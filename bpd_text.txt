Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
CHIEF'S PREFACE
The men and women of the Berkeley Police Department aspire to provide exceptional community
service to the citizens of Berkeley. The character and responsibilities surrounding the law
enforcement field requires that all personnel be given specific and consistent instructions to
execute their duties and obligations. This manual is designed to provide each member a working
guide to follow to aid in the requirements of their duties. While sworn and non-sworn personnel are
responsible for making discretionary decisions, we are all bound by law and standards to be fair,
consistent, impartial and professional. The policies, procedures, and rules set forth in this manual
are a guide to the exercise of discretion and execution of duty.
The system of policy and procedure outlined in this manual reflects basic departmental functions in
the major operational and administrative areas. These systems are provided to establish a format
for a methodical approach to achieving Department goals and objectives. Policies and procedures
are designed to support a clear understanding of the constraints and limitations allowed under law
and to convey the Department's expectations of work performance.
This manual is a tool to be used to supplement individual training and experience, and is not
intended to discourage employee initiative. It will not encompass every situation encountered by
a member, so judicious exercise of discretion may be required.
All personnel are required to be familiar with the directives in this manual and when
necessary, seek guidance and clarification from a supervisor. Members are encouraged to
submit recommendations for constructive changes to improve the Department's efficiency and
effectiveness. This manual will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the law, personnel
responsibilities, and Department goals and objectives.
Disclaimer: The policies, procedures, and rules expressed in this manual are for Departmental
use only and do not apply in any criminal or civil proceeding. Any policy, procedure and/or rule
shall not be construed as a higher legal standard of care or safety in an evidentiary sense with
respect to third party claims. When a conflict occurs in any directive in this manual with Federal
laws, State Statutes, City Ordinances or City Personnel Policies, the existing Federal law, State
Statute, City Ordinance or City Personnel Policy will supersede the directive in conflict.

LAW ENFORCEMENT CODE OF ETHICS
As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to safeguard
lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or
intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights
of all to liberty, equality and justice.
I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does
not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger,
scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest
in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law
and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is
confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in
the performance of my duty.
I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, aspirations,
animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with
relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without
fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting
gratuities.
I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be
held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption
or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by other police officers. I will cooperate with all legally
authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice.
I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take
every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence.
I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my
chosen profession . . . law enforcement.

current law (e.g., California Public Records Act). Messages transmitted over the Department's
electronic communication systems must only be those that involve official business activities or
contain information essential to employees for the accomplishment of business-related tasks and/
or communication directly related to the business, administrations or practices of the Department.
204.2 EMAIL RIGHT OF PRIVACY
All email messages, including any attachments, that are transmitted over department networks are
considered department records and therefore are department property. The Department reserves
the right to access, audit or disclose, for any lawful reason, any message including any attachment
that is transmitted over its email system or that is stored on any department system.
The email system is not a confidential system since all communications transmitted on, to or from
the system are the property of the Department. Therefore, the email system is not appropriate
for confidential communications. If a communication must be private, an alternative method to
communicate the message should be used instead of email. Employees using the Department’s
email system shall have no expectation of privacy concerning communications utilizing the system.
Employees should not use personal accounts to exchange email or other information that is related
to the official business of the Department.
204.3 CHECKING EMAIL AND THE CRIME FORUM
Employees shall check their email and Crime Forum accounts for new messages or posts at least
two times each duty shift.
(a) It is recommended that the accounts be checked close to the beginning and end of
each shift in order to maximize the employee's exposure to new email messages and
crime information.
When requested by the sender of a message, or as otherwise necessary or appropriate,
employees shall respond to received email in a timely fashion.
Mis-addressed email should be sent back to the original sender with an advisement that the
message was mis-addressed.
Employees may forward or re-distribute copies of email messages only when doing so fulfills a
legitimate work-related purpose.

related items that are of particular interest to all users. Personal advertisements are not

Professional Standards Division should promptly take appropriate steps to look into

temporary suspension should become permanent revocation.
iii. The retiree will forfeit his/her right to a hearing and the CCW endorsement
will be permanently revoked if the retiree fails to respond to the notice of
hearing within the 15-day period.

in a timely manner, the Professional Standards Division should attempt to make
the above notice of temporary suspension through another law enforcement
officer. For example, if a retiree was arrested or detained by a distant agency, the
Professional Standards Division may request that a law enforcement officer from
that agency act as the agent of the Department to deliver the written notification.

In the event that an application is denied at the conclusion of, or during, phase one, the applicant
shall be notified in writing within 90 days of the initial application or within 30 days after receipt
of the applicant's criminal background check from the California DOJ, whichever is later. If the

that is unsafe (Penal Code § 31910).

§ 26205).
207.5 LIMITED BUSINESS LICENSE TO CARRY A CONCEALED FIREARM
The authority to issue a limited business license to carry a concealed firearm to a non-resident
applicant is granted only to the Sheriff of the county in which the applicant works. A chief of a
municipal police department may not issue limited licenses (Penal Code § 26150). Therefore,

any of the following reasons:

Use of Force
300.1 SANCTITY OF LIFE
The Berkeley Police Department’s highest priority is safeguarding the life, dignity, and liberty of
all persons. Officers shall demonstrate this principle in their daily interactions with the community
they are sworn to protect and serve. The Department is committed to accomplishing this mission
with respect and minimal reliance on the use of force by using rapport-building communication,
crisis intervention, and de-escalation tactics before resorting to force. Officers must respect the
sanctity of all human life, act in all possible respects to preserve human life, do everything possible
to avoid unnecessary uses of force, and minimize the force that is used, while still protecting
themselves and the public.
300.1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy sets forth criteria governing the use of force. All officers are responsible for knowing
and complying with this policy and conducting themselves in a manner that reflects the Berkeley
Police Department's Use of Force Core Principles. Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary
action, including and up to termination, and may subject the officer to criminal prosecution.
Supervisors shall ensure that all personnel in their command know the content of this policy and
operate in compliance with it.
300.1.2 USE OF FORCE STANDARD
In dealing with suspects, officers shall use alternatives to physical force whenever reasonably
possible. In all cases where physical force is used, officers shall use a minimum amount of force
that is objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and proportional to effectively and safely
resolve a conflict.
The United States Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), held that, in order to
comply with the U.S. Constitution, an officer’s use of force must be objectively reasonable under
the totality of circumstances known to the officer at the time. Additionally, Penal Code section
835(a) imposes further restrictions on an officer’s use of force. But these standards merely set
the minimum standard for police conduct, below which an officer’s conduct would be regarded
as unlawful.
In fulfilling this Department’s mission to safeguard the life, dignity, and liberty of officers themselves
and all members of the community they are sworn to protect and serve, this policy requires more
of our officers than simply not violating the law. As a result, this policy is more restrictive than the
minimum constitutional standard and state law in two important respects.
First, it imposes a higher duty upon officers to use a minimal amount of force objectively necessary
to safely achieve their legitimate law enforcement objective. And, second, this policy imposes
a stricter obligation on officers to exert only such force that is objectively proportionate to
the circumstances, requiring a consideration of the seriousness of the suspected offense, the
availability of de-escalation and other less aggressive techniques, and the risks of harm presented
to members of the public and to the officers involved.

Use of Force
Additionally, Penal Code section 835(a) imposes further restrictions on an officer’s use of force.
300.1.3 CORE PRINCIPLES
A. DE-ESCALATION AND FORCE MINIMIZATION. Every officer’s goal, throughout an encounter
with a member of the public, shall be to de-escalate wherever possible and resolve the encounter
without resorting to the use of force. Wherever possible, officers shall employ de-escalation
techniques to increase the likelihood of voluntary compliance with law enforcement requests or
directives and, thereby, decrease the likelihood that a use of force will become necessary during
an incident. Further, in any encounters that do call for applying force, officers must always use a
minimal amount of force that is objectively reasonable and objectively necessary to safely achieve
their legitimate law enforcement objective.
B. PROPORTIONALITY. When determining the appropriate level of force, at all times officers
shall balance the severity of the offense committed and the level of resistance based on the totality
of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time. It is particularly important
that officers apply proportionality and critical decision making when encountering a subject who
is unarmed or armed with a weapon other than a firearm.
C. MINIMIZING THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. Deadly force may only be used when it is
objectively reasonable that such action is immediately necessary to protect the officer or another
person from imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm. Officers shall not use deadly force
if it is objectively reasonable that alternative techniques will eliminate the imminent danger and
ultimately achieve the law enforcement purpose with less risk of harm to the officer or to other
persons
D. DUTY TO INTERCEDE. Whenever possible, officers shall intervene when they know or have
reason to know that another officer is about to use, or is using, unnecessary force. Officers shall
promptly report any use of unnecessary force and the efforts made to intervene to a supervisor.
E. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. Officers should be particularly sensitive when considering the
use of force against vulnerable populations, including children, elderly persons, pregnant women,
people with physical and mental disabilities, and people with limited English proficiency.
F. FOSTER STRONG COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS. The Berkeley Police Department
understands that uses of force, even if lawful and proper, can have a damaging effect on the
public's perception of the Department and the Department's relationship with the community. The
Department is committed to fostering strong community relations by building on its historic tradition
of progressive policing, ensuring accountability and transparency, and striving to increase trust
with our community.
G. FAIR AND UNBIASED POLICING. Members of the Berkeley Police Department shall carry
out their duties, including the use of force, in a manner that is fair and unbiased, in accordance
with Policy 401, Fair and Impartial Policing.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Use of Force
Minimal amount necessary– The least amount of force within a range that is objectively
reasonable and objectively necessary to safely effect an arrest or achieve some other legitimate
law enforcement purpose.
Deadly force - Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily
injury, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.
Feasible - Reasonably capable of being done or carried out under the circumstances to
successfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another
person.
Force - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents or weapons to another
person. It is not a use of force when a person allows themselves to be searched, escorted,
handcuffed or restrained.
Less-Than-Lethal Force – Any use of force which, due to possible physiological effects of
application, presents less potential for causing death or serious injury than conventional lethal
force options. Less-than-lethal force options include, but are not limited to, a specialized launcher,
or other authorized device that can discharge, fire, launch or otherwise propel single or multiple
flexible or non-flexible projectiles designed to cause physiological effects consistent with blunt
force impact.
Non-Lethal Force – Any use of force other than lethal force or less-than lethal force.
Compliant Suspect – Cooperative and/or responsive to lawful commands.
Passive Resistance - When an individual does not follow the lawful verbal commands of a police
officer, but does not physically resist in any way.
Examples: A person who goes completely limp, sits down and refuses to stand or walk, or who
may stand with arms at their sides without attempting to strike at or physically resist officers.
Active Resistance - An individual who is uncooperative and fails to comply with the lawful
verbal commands of a police officer, and attempts to avoid physical control and/or arrest by
physically struggling to free oneself from being restrained. The individual may also use verbal non-
compliance (refusing a lawful order or direction).
Examples: A person who attempts to avoid physical control and/or arrest by pulling or pushing
away from the officer, tensing arm or muscles, hiding from the officer, and/or fleeing.
Combative Resistance - An individual not only resists the officer, but poses a threat of harm to
the officer or others, in an aggressive manner that may cause physical injury.
Examples: A person who violently attempts to or attacks an officer. This action is sometimes
preceded by “pre-assault” cues such as taking a threatening stance (clenching fists, facial
expressions, threats, etc.) and verbal non-compliance.

Use of Force
Control Hold - Any Department approved hold, designed to allow an officer to control the
movement of a subject (e.g., twist lock, rear wrist lock, finger lock, etc.). A control hold can be
applied without implementing pain.
Pain Compliance Technique- Involves either the manipulation of a person’s joints or activating
certain pressure points intended to create sufficient pain for the purpose of motivating a person
to comply with verbal commands (examples of pressure points include buccal nerve, gum nerve,
sternum rub).
Control Techniques– Personal Impact Weapons and Take Downs.
Personal Body Weapons- An officer’s use of his/her body part, including but not limited to hand,
foot, knee, elbow, shoulder, hip, arm, leg or head by means of kinetic energy transfer (impact)
to gain control of a subject.
Blue Team (BT)– Computer software that allows officers to enter use of force and other incidents
from a Department computer.
Concealment - Anything which conceals a person from view.
Cover - Anything which provides protection from bullets or other projectiles fired or thrown. Cover
is subjective and its effectiveness depends upon the threat’s ballistic capability (handgun, rifle,
etc.).
Blocking- The positioning of a police vehicle in the path of an occupied subject vehicle where
contact between the vehicles is not anticipated or is anticipated to be minimal.
Ramming- The use of a vehicle to intentionally hit another vehicle
Serious bodily injury- A bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, causes serious,
permanent disfigurement or results in a prolonged loss or impairment of the functioning of any
bodily member or organ
Officer (or) Police Officer- Any sworn peace officer.
Authorized Employee- Any non-sworn employee who has received defensive tactics training and
has been authorized by the Chief of Police to use non-lethal force.
Employee– Any non-sworn employee of the Berkeley Police Department, including those deemed
“authorized employees.”
Objectively Reasonable – “Objectively reasonable” means an officer’s conduct will be evaluated
through the eyes of the hypothetically reasonable officer standing in the shoes of the involved
officer.
Totality of the circumstances – All facts known to the officer at the time, including the conduct
of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of force.

300.2 DUTY TO INTERCEDE AND DUTY TO REPORT
Any officer who observes another officer or member of the Berkeley Police Department using
force that is clearly in violation of this policy shall immediately take reasonable action to attempt
to mitigate such use of force. This may include verbal intervention or, when in a position to do so,
physical intervention. Further, any officer who learns of a potentially unauthorized use of force,
even if the officer did not witness it personally, shall promptly report this information to an on-duty
sergeant or a command officer at the first opportunity.
Any officer who observes an employee or member of a different law enforcement agency use
force that exceeds the degree of force permitted by law shall promptly report these observations
to an on-duty sergeant or a command officer at the first opportunity.
300.3 USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST
Any peace officer may use objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and proportional force
to effect an arrest, to prevent escape, or to overcome resistance. A peace officer who makes or
attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist from his/her efforts by reason of resistance
or threatened resistance on the part of the person being arrested; nor shall an officer be deemed
the aggressor or lose his/her right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the
arrest, prevent escape, or to overcome resistance. For the purpose of this policy, "retreat" does
not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.
300.3.1 FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS, NECESSITY, AND
PROPORTIONALITY OF FORCE
When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable,
objectively necessary, and proportional force, a number of factors should be taken into
consideration, as time and circumstances permit. These factors include but are not limited to:
(a) The apparent immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others.
(b) The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer
at the time.
(c) Officer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level
of exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects).
(d) The conduct of the involved officer.
(e) The effects of drugs or alcohol.
(f) The individual's apparent mental state or capacity.
(g) The individual’s apparent ability to understand and comply with officer commands.
(h) Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.
(i) The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to
resist despite being restrained.
(j) The availability of other reasonable and feasible options and their possible
effectiveness.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Use of Force
(k) Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual.
(l) Training and experience of the officer.
(m) Potential for injury to officers, suspects, bystanders, and others.
(n) Whether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight, or
is attacking the officer.
(o) The risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape.
(p) The apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the
situation.
(q) Whether the conduct of the individual being confronted no longer reasonably appears
to pose an imminent threat to the officer or others.
(r) Prior contacts with the subject or awareness of any propensity for violence.
(s) Any other exigent circumstances.
The level of resistance that an officer encounters is a key factor in determining the proportionate
amount of force. It is not possible to determine ahead of time what the proportionate level
of force is for every possible situation that officers may face. Nevertheless, one of the key
factors in determining what level of force is objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and
proportionate in a given situation is the level of resistance that an officer encounters. In general,
the less resistance an officer faces, the less force the officer should use. The types of resistance
officers may encounter fall along a continuum, from a cooperative person to an active assailant.
Consistent with training, the following general rules apply when officers are exercising judgment
in determining what level of force is necessary and proportionate:
• Compliant – In general, when dealing with a compliant person, officers may rely on
police presence and/or verbal control techniques, but should not use greater force.
• Passive resistance – In general, when dealing with a suspect involved in passive
resistance, officers may rely on police presence, verbal control techniques, or control
holds, but should not use greater force.
• Active resistance – In general, in dealing with a suspect involved in active resistance,
in addition to the options available for passive resistance, officers may rely on pain
compliance techniques or takedowns, but should not use greater force.
• Combative resistance – In general, in dealing with a suspect involved in combative
resistance, officers have all use-of-force options available to them, but deadly force
shall only be used in compliance with this policy as described in Section 300.4.
300.3.2 USE OF FORCE CONTINUUM
The Department uses a “use of force continuum” that refers to the concept that there are
reasonable responses for every threat an officer faces in a hostile situation. The force utilized
need not be sequential (e.g., gradual or preceded by attempts at lower levels of force) if those
lower levels are not appropriate. All Uses of Force must be objectively reasonable, objectively
necessary, and proportional, based on a totality of the circumstances. All progressions must rest
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Use of Force - 62
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Use of Force
on the premise that officers shall escalate and de-escalate their level of force in response to the
subject's actions.
Continuum of Force
• Officer Presence — No force is used. Considered the best way to resolve a
situation.
o The mere presence of a law enforcement officer works to deter crime or diffuse
a situation.
o Officers' attitudes are professional and nonthreatening.
• Verbalization — Force is not physical.
o Officers issue calm, nonthreatening commands, such as "Let me see your
identification and registration."
o Officers may increase their volume and shorten commands in an attempt to gain
compliance. Short commands might include "Stop," or "Don't move."
• Weaponless defense — Officers use bodily force to gain control of a situation.
o Pain Compliance and control holds.Officers use grabs, holds and joint locks to
restrain an individual.
o Personal body weapons.Officers may use punches and kicks to restrain an
individual.
• Less-Lethal Force Methods — Officers use less-lethal technologies to gain
control of a situation.
o Blunt impact.Officers may use a baton or projectile to immobilize a combative
person.
o Chemical. Officers may use chemical sprays or projectiles embedded with
chemicals to restrain an individual (e.g., pepper spray).
• Lethal Force — Officers may use lethal weapons only in compliance with Section
300.4.
300.3.3 USE OF FORCE TO SEIZE EVIDENCE
In general, officers may use reasonable force to lawfully seize evidence and to prevent the
destruction of evidence. However, officers are discouraged from using force solely to prevent
a person from swallowing evidence or contraband. In the instance when force is used, officers
should not intentionally use any technique that restricts blood flow to the head, restricts respiration
or which creates a reasonable likelihood that blood flow to the head or respiration would be
restricted. Officers are encouraged to use techniques and methods taught by the Berkeley Police
Department for this specific purpose.
300.3.4 DE-ESCALATION TACTICS
De-escalation tactics and techniques are actions used by officers which seek to minimize the
need to use force during an incident. Such tactics and techniques may increase the likelihood of
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Use of Force - 63
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Use of Force
voluntary compliance when employed and shall be used when it is safe to do so, De-escalation
tactics emphasize slowing an incident down to allow time, distance and flexibility for the situation to
resolve. Officers shall continually assess the dynamics of a situation, and modulate their response
and actions appropriately. Officers may be justified in using force at one moment, but not justified
in using force the next moment due to a change in dynamics.
The application of these tactics is intended to increase the potential for resolution with a minimal
reliance on the use of force, or without using force at all.
If immediate action is not necessary, an officer(s) shall attempt to use verbal de-escalation
techniques. When available and when practicable, a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officer, crisis
negotiator, or Berkeley Mental Health Mobile Crisis Team member shall be called upon as a
resource.
Officers shall gather information about the incident, assess the risks, assemble resources, attempt
to slow momentum and communicate and coordinate a response. In their interaction with subjects,
officers should use advisements, warnings, verbal persuasion and other tactics and alternatives
to any levels of force. Officers should move to a position that is tactically more secure or allows
them greater distance to consider or deploy a greater variety of force options.
(a) De-escalation techniques may include verbal persuasion, warnings and tactical de-
escalation techniques, such as: slowing down the pace of an incident; “waiting out”
subjects; creating distance (and thus the reactionary gap) between the officer and the
threat; and requesting additional resources (e.g., specialized units, mental health care
providers, negotiators, etc.) to resolve the incident.
(b) Officers should recognize that they may withdraw to a position that is tactically
advantageous or allows them greater distance to de-escalate a situation.
(c) Officers should consider a variety of options, including lesser force or no force options.
(d) Officers should attempt to understand and consider possible reasons why a subject
may be noncompliant or resisting arrest.
(e) A subject may not be capable of understanding the situation because of a medical
condition; mental, physical, or hearing impairment; language barrier; drug interaction;
or emotional crisis, and have no criminal intent. These situations may not make
the subject any less dangerous, but understanding a subject’s situation may enable
officers to calm the subject and allow officers to use de-escalation techniques while
maintaining public and officer safety.
(f) Officers should continue de-escalation techniques, when feasible and appropriate,
and take as much time as reasonably necessary to resolve the incident, in effort to
avoid and/or minimize the use of force.
(g) When an officer recognizes that mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol
and/or drug addictions, or other health issues are causing an individual to behave
erratically, the officer shall, when feasible and appropriate, try to de-escalate the
situation using de-escalation and/or crisis Intervention techniques.

Use of Force
(h) Establishing communication with non-compliant subjects is often most effective when
officers establish rapport, use the proper voice intonation, ask questions and provide
advice to defuse conflict and achieve voluntary compliance before resorting to force
options.
(i) The officer’s physical actions may also de-escalate a potentially volatile/violent
situation; e.g., exhibiting relaxed body language.
When time and circumstances allow, officers shall consider the following tactical principles:
(a) Make a tactical approach to the scene.
(b) Maintain a safe distance.
(c) Use available cover or concealment and identify escape routes.
(d) Stage Berkeley Fire Department.
(e) Control vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
(f) Establish communication, preferably with one officer.
(g) Create an emergency plan and a deliberate plan with contingencies.
(h) The officer’s physical actions may also de-escalate a potentially volatile/violent
situation; e.g., exhibiting relaxed body language.
300.3.5 PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES
Pain compliance techniques may be effective in controlling a physically or actively resisting
individual. Officers may only apply those pain compliance techniques for which they have
successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain compliance
technique should consider:
(a) The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level
of resistance.
(b) Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer.
(c) Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply.
The purpose of pain compliance is to direct a person's actions. The application of any pain
compliance technique shall be discontinued once the officer determines that compliance has been
achieved.
300.3.6 USE OF NON-LETHAL FORCE
When lethal force and less-than-lethal force are not authorized, officers and authorized employees
may use objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and proportional approved non-lethal force
techniques and weapons in the following circumstances:
(a) To protect themselves or another person from physical injury;
(b) To restrain or subdue a resistant individual; or
(c) To bring an unlawful situation safely and effectively under control.

300.3.7 RESTRAINT AND CONTROL DEVICES
Restraint and control devices shall not be used to punish, to display authority or as a show of
force. Handcuffs, body wraps and spit hoods shall only be used consistent with Policy 302. Batons,
approved less-lethal projectiles, and approved chemical agents shall only be used consistent with
Policy 303. As per City Council resolution (June 9, 2020), the use of tear gas by employees
of the Berkeley Police Department, or any outside department or agency called to respond to
mutual aid in Berkeley, is prohibited. Pepper spray or smoke for crowd control by employees of
the Berkeley Police Department, or any outside department or agency called to respond to mutual
aid in Berkeley, is prohibited during the COVID-19 pandemic, or until such time as the City Council
removes the prohibition.
300.3.8 CHOKEHOLD PROHIBITION
The use of a Carotid Restraint Hold is prohibited. Carotid Restraint Hold: Council Resolution No.
52,605 - N.S., February 14, 1985, “Prohibiting use of ‘chokehold’ for law enforcement purposes in
the City of Berkeley” states: “Be it resolved by the Council of the City of Berkeley as follows: That
the chokehold, including but not limited to the carotid restraint and the bar-arm hold, is hereby
banned from use for law enforcement purposes in the City of Berkeley.”
The term bar-arm refers to a variety of techniques. The use of any chokehold is strictly prohibited.
A chokehold is any hold or contact with the neck – including a carotid restraint -- that may inhibit
breathing by compression of the airway in the neck, may inhibit blood flow by compression of
the blood vessels in the neck, or that applies pressure to the front, side, or back of the neck. As
defined in the City Council Resolution, “bar-arm hold” refers to any use of the forearm to exert
pressure against the front of the neck. However, other types of arm hold techniques (e.g., those
that involve control of the arm, wrist or elbow) remain authorized.
300.4 USE OF DEADLY FORCE
An officer's use of deadly force is justified only when it is objectively reasonable, based on the
totality of the circumstances, that such force is objectively necessary to, 1) defend against an
imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another or 2) apprehend a
suspected fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury,
provided that it is objectively reasonable that the person will cause imminent death or serious
bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.
Where feasible, the officer shall, prior to the use of deadly force, make reasonable efforts to identify
themselves as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless it is objectively
reasonable that the person is aware of those facts.
An officer shall not use deadly force against another person if it reasonably appears that doing so
would unnecessarily endanger innocent people.
Lethal force is prohibited when its sole purpose is to effect an arrest, overcome resistance or
prevent a subject from escaping when the subject does not present an immediate danger of death
or serious bodily injury. Lethal force is also prohibited solely to prevent property damage or prevent
the destruction of evidence.

Use of Force
An “imminent” threat of death or serious bodily injury exists when, based on the totality of
the circumstances, it is objectivelyreasonable to believe that a person has the present ability,
opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the officer
or another person. An officer’s subjective fear of future harm alone is insufficient as an imminent
threat. An imminent threat is one that from appearances is reasonably believed to require instant
attention.

Given that individuals may perceive the display of a firearm as a potential application of force,
officers should carefully evaluate each tactical situation and use sound discretion when drawing
a firearm in public by considering the following guidelines:
(a) If the officer does not initially perceive a threat but it is objectively reasonable that the
potential for such threat exists, firearms should generally be kept in the low-ready or
other position not directed toward an individual.
(b) If it is objectively reasonable that a significant threat exists based on the totality
of circumstances presented at the time (e.g., high-risk stop, tactical entry, armed
encounter), firearms may be directed toward said threat until the officer no longer
perceives such threat.
Once it is reasonably safe to do so, officers should carefully secure all firearms.
300.4.2 DIRECTED FIRE
Officers may use controlled gunfire that is directed at the suspect, reducing the suspect’s ability
to return fire while a group or individual movement is conducted, such as in a rescue operation.
Officers may only employ this tactic when dealing with a suspect who poses an immediate and
ongoing lethal threat and only under circumstances where the use of deadly force is legally
justified. Target acquisition and communication are key elements in the successful use of this
tactic. Officers remain accountable for every round fired under these circumstances. Officers must
consider their surroundings and potential risks to bystanders, to the extent reasonable under the
circumstances, before discharging a firearm.
300.4.3 SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES
Absent exigent circumstances, officers shall not discharge firearms from a moving vehicle.
Firearms shall not be discharged at a stationary or moving vehicle, the occupants of a vehicle, or
the tires of a vehicle unless a person in the vehicle is imminently threatening an officer or another
person present with deadly force. The moving vehicle alone does not presumptively constitute a
threat that justifies the use of deadly force.
Officers shall not move into, remain, or otherwise position themselves in the path of a vehicle in
an effort to detain or apprehend the occupants. Any officer in the path of a moving vehicle shall
immediately attempt to move to a position of safety rather than discharging a firearm at the vehicle
or any of the occupants.

Use of Force
Because this policy may not cover every situation that may arise, a deviation from this policy
may be objectively reasonable and objectively necessary depending on the totality of the
circumstances. A deviation from this policy would, for instance, be justified if the officer used a
firearm in an attempt to stop an imminent vehicle attack on a crowd or a mass casualty terrorist
event.
Factors that may be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the use of a firearm against a vehicle
include:
(a) The availability and use of cover, distance and/or tactical relocation
(b) Incident command and personnel placement
(c) Tactical approach
(d) Regard for viable target acquisition and background including location, other traffic,
the presence of innocent persons, and police officers.
300.5 USE OF VEHICLES
Officers shall not use police vehicles to ram or block other vehicles, persons, or moving objects in a
manner that reasonably appears to constitute the use of lethal force, except under circumstances
outlined in section 300.4 and in Policy V-6 that covers vehicle operations.
The Vehicle Containment Technique (VCT) is the positioning of a police vehicle in the path of
a suspect vehicle where contact between the vehicles is not anticipated or is anticipated to be
minimal. VCT shall only to be used on vehicles that are either stationary or moving at a slow speed.
This technique is designed to contain a suspect vehicle to a single stationary location, thereby
preventing a pursuit from initiating, or a potentially violent situation (e.g. a hostage situation or
person barricaded inside a vehicle) from becoming mobile.
When properly utilized, the VCT can give officers time, distance, and cover in order to safely and
effectively resolve a situation.
300.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
All uses of force shall be documented promptly, completely and accurately in an appropriate report,
depending on the nature of the incident and the level of force used. The officer should articulate
the factors perceived and why they believed the use of force was objectively reasonable and
objectively necessary under the circumstances. Whenever an officer or employee uses Oleoresin
Capsicum (pepper spray) they must also complete a “Use of Pepper Spray Report.” Whenever
an officer or employee use body wrap or spit hood restraint devices they must also complete a
“Use of Restraint Device Report” and document, review and report such uses in accordance with
section 300.11.
Upon receiving notification of a use of force, an uninvolved supervisor, when feasible, shall
determine the level of force reporting level, investigation, documentation and review requirements.

300.6.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY
A supervisor should respond to any reported use of force, if reasonably available. The responding
supervisor is expected to:
(a) Obtain the basic facts from the involved officers. Absent an allegation of misconduct
or excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of
duties.
(b) Ensure that any injured parties are examined and treated.
(c) Once any initial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been
rendered, ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible
injury or complaint of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These
photographs should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.
(d) Identify any witnesses not already included in related reports.
(e) Review and approve all related reports.
(f) Review body worn camera footage related to the incident.
In the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported
application of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as
circumstances permit.
300.6.2 USE OF FORCE REPORTING LEVELS
Level 1
The officer used any of the following, and the circumstances of the application would lead
an objectively reasonable officer to conclude that the subject did not experience more than
momentary discomfort:
1. Control holds/ pain compliance techniques
2. Leverage
3. Grab
4. Bodyweight
5. The officer lowered the subject to a seated position or to the ground while partially or
completely supporting the person’s bodyweight.
6. Takedown
If the incident fits the parameters for a Level 1 incident, the supervisor will enter all applicable data
into the Blue Team template with a brief summary.
Level 2
(a) No suspect injury or complaint of continuing pain due to interaction with officer.
(b) Officer’s use of force was limited to the following:
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Use of Force - 69
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Use of Force
1. Firearm drawn from the holster or otherwise deployed during an interaction with
an individual, and/or pointed at an individual. For the purposes of this section,
"interaction" shall be defined as a situation in which an individual could reasonably
believe the deployment and/or pointing of a firearm could be an attempt to gain
compliance.
2. Control hold, pressure point, leverage, grab, takedown, and/or bodyweight,
and the application would lead a reasonably objective officer to conclude that the
individual may have experienced more than momentary discomfort.
An uninvolved supervisor, when feasible, will respond to the scene and conduct a Use of Force
Investigation, ensuring that statements are taken from the suspect and witnesses, and that photos
are taken of all involved parties. If the incident fits the parameters for a Level 2 incident, the
supervisor will enter all applicable data into the Blue Team template with a brief summary.
Level 3
(a) Suspect has sustained an injury or complains of injury or continuing pain due to
interaction with the officer.
(b) Would have otherwise been classified as a Level 2, except officer body worn camera
was not activated in a timely manner, prior to the enforcement contact, per policy.
(c) The officer used any of the following force options:
1. Chemical Agents/Munitions
2. Impact Weapon Strikes
3. Personal Body Weapons
An uninvolved supervisor, when practical, will respond to the scene and conduct a Use of Force
Investigation, ensuring that statements are taken from the suspect and witnesses. If the incident
fits the parameters for a Level 3 incident, the supervisor will enter all applicable data into the Blue
Team template.
The supervisor will also complete a Use of Force Investigation Report narrative in Blue Team for
review through the Use of Force Review process. Suspect and witness statements from the crime
report will be attached to the use of force investigation.
Level 4
Any incident involving deadly force or any force likely to cause death or serious bodily injury will
be investigated under the protocols outlined in Policy P-12.
300.6.3 EMPLOYEE USE OF FORCE
When any Berkeley Police Department employee has engaged in a use of force as defined in
this policy, the use of force must be reported to a Berkeley Police supervisor and investigated in
accordance with this policy.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Use of Force - 70

Use of Force
(a) In the event a use of force as described as Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 occurs during
an unusual occurrence as described in General Order U-4, the officer shall prepare a
supplemental report as soon as practical following the incident.
(a) Each officer shall include in the report, to the extent possible, specific information
regarding each use of force, e.g. the reason for the use of force, location, description
of the individual(s) upon whom force was used, type of force used, etc.
300.6.4 PUBLIC RECORDS
Records related to use of force incidents shall be retained and disclosed in compliance
with California Penal Code section 832.7, California Government Code section 6254(f), and
Department Policy R-23.
300.7 MEDICAL CONSIDERATION
When an officer or employee uses force that results in injury, or when a subject complains that
an injury has been inflicted, theofficersor employee shall promptly provide, if trained, or otherwise
promptly procure medical assistance when reasonable and safe to do so in order to ensure that
the subject receives appropriate medical care.
The on-scene supervisor or, if the on-scene supervisor is not available, the primary handling officer
shall ensure that any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following
any use of force is informed that the person was subjected to force.
Persons who exhibit extreme agitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied by profuse
sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain
(sometimes called “excited delirium”), or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple
officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving
these persons should be considered medical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a
medical emergency should request medical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical
personnel stage away if appropriate.
300.8 USE OF FORCE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
The Division Captain shall review the Use of Force Report (and when applicable, Use of Pepper
Spray Report or Use of Restraint Device Report) and route the report to the Chief of Police with
a recommendation of findings. The Chief of Police may convene a Review Board as outlined in
Policy 301 instead of utilizing Division Captain Review.
The Chief of Police shall make a finding that the use of force was either within policy or initiate
additional administrative review/investigation as may be appropriate.
Any determination concerning the propriety of force used shall be based on the facts and
information available to the officer at the time the force was employed, and not upon information
gained after the fact.
All Use of Force Reports shall be reviewed to determine whether Departmental use of force
regulations, policies, or procedures were: 1) violated or followed; 2) clearly understood, effective,

Law Enforcement Manual
Handcuffing and Restraints
302.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for the use of handcuffs and other restraints during detentions and
arrests.
302.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department authorizes the use of restraint devices in accordance with this
policy, the Use of Force Policy and department training. Restraint devices shall not be used to
punish, to display authority or as a show of force.
302.3 USE OF RESTRAINTS
Only members who have successfully completed Berkeley Police Department approved training
on the use of restraint devices described in this policy are authorized to use these devices.
When deciding whether to use any restraint, officers should carefully balance officer safety
concerns with factors that include, but are not limited to:
(a) The circumstances or crime leading to the arrest
(b) The demeanor and behavior of the arrested person
(c) The age and health of the person
(d) Whether the person may be pregnant
(e) Whether the person has a hearing or speaking disability. In such cases, consideration
should be given, safety permitting, to handcuffing to the front in order to allow the
person to sign or write notes
(f) Whether the person has any other apparent disability
302.4 RESTRAINT OF DETAINEES
Situations may arise where it may be reasonable to restrain an individual who may, after brief
investigation, be released without arrest. Unless arrested, the use of restraints on detainees should
continue only for as long as is reasonably necessary to assure the safety of officers and others.
When deciding whether to remove restraints from a detainee, officers should continuously weigh
the safety interests at hand against the continuing intrusion upon the detainee.
302.5 ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF RESTRAINT
Alternative Means of Restraint include but are not limited to:
(a) Handcuffing the person with their hands in front of their body
(b) Handcuffing the person with multiple sets of linked handcuffs
(c) Use of the entire WRAP system
(d) Use of the WRAP’s ankle strap
(e) Use of plastic handcuffs, aka flex-cuffs

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Handcuffing and Restraints
(f) Use of an ambulance gurney with five point straps
302.6 RESTRAINT OF PREGNANT PERSONS
Persons who are known to be pregnant should be restrained in the least restrictive manner that
is effective for officer safety and in no event shall these persons be restrained by the use of leg
irons, waist chains or handcuffs behind the body.
No person who is in labor, delivery or recovery after delivery shall be handcuffed or restrained
except in extraordinary circumstances and only when a supervisor makes an individualized
determination that such restraints are necessary for the safety of the arrestee, officers or others
(Penal Code § 3407; Penal Code § 6030).
302.7 RESTRAINT OF JUVENILES
A juvenile under 14 years of age should not be restrained unless he/she is suspected of a
dangerous felony or when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile may resist,
attempt escape, injure him/herself, injure the officer or damage property.
302.8 NOTIFICATIONS
Whenever an officer transports a person with the use of restraints other than handcuffs, the officer
shall inform the jail staff upon arrival at the jail that restraints were used. This notification should
include information regarding any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would
be potential safety concerns or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme
agitation, impaired respiration) that may have occurred prior to, or during transportation to the jail.
302.9 APPLICATION OF HANDCUFFS OR PLASTIC CUFFS
Handcuffs, including temporary plastic cuffs, aka flex-cuffs, may be used only to restrain a person’s
hands to ensure officer safety.
Although recommended for most arrest situations, handcuffing is not an absolute requirement
of the Department. Officers should consider handcuffing any person they reasonably believe
warrants that degree of restraint. However, officers should not conclude that regardless of the
circumstances, every person should be handcuffed.
In most situations handcuffs should be applied with the hands behind the person’s back. When
feasible, handcuffs should be applied between the base of the palm and the ulna bone of the wrist.
When feasible, handcuffs should be double-locked to prevent tightening, which may cause undue
discomfort or injury to the hands or wrists.
In situations where one pair of handcuffs does not appear sufficient to restrain the individual or may
cause unreasonable discomfort due to the person’s size, officers should consider using alternative
means of restraint.
If the person being handcuffed is on the ground or in a prone position, officers should, as soon
as possible, place the person in an upright sitting position or on their side for respiratory recovery
and to mitigate the potential for positional asphyxia.

Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Handcuffing and Restraints
Handcuffs should be removed as soon as it is reasonable or after the person has been searched
and is safely confined within a detention facility.
302.10 APPLICATION OF SPIT HOODS/MASKS/SOCKS
Spit hoods, aka spit masks or spit socks, are temporary protective devices designed to prevent the
wearer from transferring or transmitting fluids (saliva and mucous) to others. As the Department
recognizes that use of a spit hood may be experienced as a traumatic event to a wearer, and may
cause alarm and concern to onlookers, this policy provides clear and specific guidelines for their
use, in service of the safety of all parties involved.
Spit hoods may be placed upon persons in custody while the officer reasonably believes the
person will bite or spit, either on a person or in an inappropriate place. They are generally used
during application of a physical restraint, while the person is restrained, or during or after transport.
Officers utilizing spit hoods shall ensure that the spit hood is applied properly to allow for adequate
ventilation and that the restrained person can breathe normally. Officers should provide assistance
during the movement of restrained individuals due to the potential for impaired or distorted vision
on the part of the individual. Officers should avoid comingling individuals wearing spit hoods with
other detainees.
Spit hoods shall not be used in situations where there are indications that the restrained person
has a medical condition evident in the area around the mouth or nose, such as difficulty breathing
or vomiting. In such cases, prompt medical care should be provided. If the person vomits while
wearing a spit hood, the spit hood shall be promptly removed and discarded. Persons who have
been sprayed with oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray should be thoroughly decontaminated including
hair, head and clothing prior to application of a spit hood.
Those who have been placed in a spit hood should be continually monitored and shall not be left
unattended until the spit hood is removed. Spit hoods shall be discarded after each use.
302.11 APPLICATION OF THE WRAP
The WRAP is a temporary restraining device comprised of a velcro strapped leg panel, torso
harness, ankle strap and backside handcuff carabiner. The device immobilizes the body into a
straight-legged seated position. Used properly, it restricts a subject’s ability to do harm to oneself
or others. Officer safety is enhanced and the risk of injury to the subject is reduced.
In determining whether to use the WRAP, officers should consider:
(a) Whether the officer or others could be exposed to injury due to the assaultive or
resistant behavior of a suspect.
(b) Whether it is reasonably necessary to protect the suspect from his/her own actions
(e.g., running away from the arresting officer while handcuffed, kicking at objects or
officers).
(c) Whether it is reasonably necessary to avoid damage to property (e.g., kicking at
windows of the patrol unit).
(d) Whether conventional methods of restraint have failed.

Handcuffing and Restraints
302.11.1 GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE WRAP
When applying the WRAP, the following guidelines should be followed:
(a) If practicable, officers should notify a supervisor of the intent to apply the WRAP. In
all cases, a supervisor shall be notified as soon as practicable after the application
of the WRAP.
(b) Once applied, absent a medical or other emergency, restraints should remain in place
until the officer arrives at the jail or other facility or the person no longer reasonably
appears to pose a threat.
(c) Restraint straps should be checked frequently for tightness, and adjusted as
necessary, until the WRAP is removed. The harness straps shall never be tightened
to the point they interfere with the person's ability to breathe.
(d) The restrained person should be continually monitored by an officer while the WRAP
is in use. The officer should ensure that the person does not roll onto and remain on
his/her stomach.
(e) The officer should look for signs of distress such as sudden quiet or inactivity,
complaints of chest pain, change in facial color, complaint of extreme heat, vomiting,
and/or labored breathing, and take appropriate steps to relieve and minimize any
obvious factors contributing to this condition.
(f) Movement of the person can be accomplished in three ways, depending on the level
of their cooperation; the person can be carried, allowed to stand and shuffle walk or
be transported in a vehicle.
(g) Once secured in a vehicle, the person should be placed in a seated or upright position,
secured with a seat belt, and shall not be placed on his/her stomach for an extended
period, as this could reduce the person’s ability to breathe.
(h) If in custody and transported by ambulance/paramedic unit, the restrained person
should be accompanied by an officer when requested by medical personnel. The
transporting officer should describe to medical personnel any unusual behaviors or
other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or
medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired
respiration).
302.11.2 DEVICE REMOVAL
Based on the prisoner’s combativeness or level of aggression, officers should employ appropriate

Control Devices and Techniques
303.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for the use and maintenance of control devices that are described
herein.
303.2 POLICY
In order to control subjects who are violent or who demonstrate the intent to be violent, the Berkeley
Police Department authorizes officers to use control devices and techniques in accordance with
the guidelines in this policy and the Use of Force Policy.
303.3 ISSUING, CARRYING AND USING CONTROL DEVICES
Control devices described in this policy may be carried and used by members of this department
only if the device has been issued by the Department or approved by the Chief of Police, or his/
her designee.
Only officers who have successfully completed department-approved training in the use of any
control device are authorized to carry and use the device.
Control devices may be used when a decision has been made to control, restrain or arrest a
subject who is violent or who demonstrates the intent to be violent, and the use of the device
appears reasonable under the circumstances. When reasonable, a verbal warning and opportunity
to comply should precede the use of these devices.
When using control devices, officers should carefully consider potential impact areas in order to
minimize injuries and unintentional targets.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 303.9, kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents
shall not be used to disperse any assembly, protest, or demonstration (Penal Code 13652).
303.4 RESPONSIBILITIES
303.4.1 WATCH COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITIES
The Watch Commander may authorize the use of a control device by selected personnel or
members of specialized units who have successfully completed the required training.
303.4.2 PERSONNEL AND TRAINING SERGEANT RESPONSIBILITIES
The Personnel and Training Sergeant, or designated instructor, shall control the inventory and
issuance of all control devices and shall ensure that all damaged, inoperative, outdated or
expended control devices or projectiles are properly disposed of, repaired or replaced.
Every control device will be periodically inspected by the Personnel and Training Sergeant or the
designated instructor for a particular control device. The inspection shall be documented.

Control Devices and Techniques
303.4.3 USER RESPONSIBILITIES
All normal maintenance, charging or cleaning shall remain the responsibility of personnel using
the various devices.
Any damaged, inoperative, outdated or expended control devices or projectiles, along with
documentation explaining the cause of the damage, shall be returned to the Personnel and
Training Sergeant for disposition. Damage to City Property forms shall also be prepared and
forwarded through the chain of command, when appropriate, explaining the cause of damage.
303.5 BATON AND COLLAPSIBLE BATON GUIDELINES
The need to immediately control a suspect must be weighed against the risk of causing serious
injury. The head, neck, throat, spine, heart, kidneys and groin should not be intentionally targeted
except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious
bodily injury or death to the officer or others.
When carrying a baton, including a collapsible baton, uniformed personnel shall carry the baton
in its authorized holder on the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry the
baton as authorized and in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of
their supervisor.
303.6 OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) SPRAY GUIDELINES
As with other control devices, OC spray (aka pepper spray) and pepper projectiles may be
considered for use to bring under control an individual or groups of individuals who are engaging in,
or are about to engage in violent behavior. Pepper projectiles and OC spray should not, however,
be used against individuals or groups who merely fail to disperse or do not reasonably appear to
present a risk to the safety of officers or the public.
303.6.1 OC SPRAY
Uniformed personnel carrying OC spray shall carry the device in its holster on the equipment belt
or external vest carrier. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry OC spray as authorized,
in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.
303.6.2 PEPPER PROJECTILE SYSTEMS
Pepper projectiles (aka "Pava" rounds) are plastic spheres that are filled with a derivative of OC
powder. Because the compressed gas launcher (aka "less lethal" launcher) delivers the projectiles
with enough force to burst the projectiles on impact and release the OC powder, the potential
exists for the projectiles to inflict injury if they strike the head, neck, spine or groin. Therefore,
personnel using a launcher should not intentionally target those areas, except when the officer
reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the
officer or others.
Officers encountering a situation that warrants the use of a launcher shall notify a supervisor as
soon as practicable. A supervisor shall respond to all incidents where the suspect has been hit or
exposed to the chemical agent. The supervisor shall ensure that all notifications and reports are
completed as required by the Use of Force Policy.

303.6.3 TREATMENT FOR OC SPRAY EXPOSURE
Persons who have been sprayed with or otherwise affected by the use of OC should be promptly
provided with clean water to cleanse the affected areas. Those persons who complain of further
severe effects shall be examined by appropriate medical personnel.
303.7 POST-APPLICATION NOTICE
Whenever OC has been introduced into a residence, building interior, vehicle or other enclosed
area, officers should provide the owners or available occupants with notice of the possible
presence of residue that could result in irritation or injury if the area is not properly cleaned.
Such notice should include advisement that clean up will be at the owner's expense. Information
regarding the method of notice and the individuals notified should be included in related reports.
303.8 LESS LETHAL PROJECTILE GUIDELINES
This department is committed to reducing the potential for violent confrontations. "Less lethal"
projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in death or serious physical injury and can
be used in an attempt to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation.
303.8.1 DEPLOYMENT AND USE
Only department-approved projectiles shall be carried and deployed. Approved projectiles may be
used to compel an individual to cease his/her actions when such projectiles present a reasonable
option.
Approved projectiles include:
(a) "Less Lethal" rounds: impact projectiles
(b) "Pava" rounds: impact projectiles containing OC/pepper spray
(c) "Marking" rounds: impact projectiles containing paint
Officers are not required or compelled to use approved projectiles in lieu of other reasonable
tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of these projectiles cannot be done safely.
The safety of hostages, innocent persons and officers takes priority over the safety of subjects
engaged in criminal or suicidal behavior.
Circumstances appropriate for deployment include, but are not limited to, situations in which:
(a) The suspect is armed with a weapon and the tactical circumstances allow for the safe
application of approved projectiles.
(b) The suspect has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others.
(c) The suspect is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other
dangerous projectiles at people and/or officers.
(d) There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has already committed a crime of
violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.
303.8.2 DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
Before discharging projectiles, the officer should consider such factors as:
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Control Devices and Techniques - 85
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Control Devices and Techniques
(a) Distance and angle to target.
(b) Type of projectiles employed.
(c) Type and thickness of subject’s clothing.
(d) The subject’s proximity to others.
(e) The location of the subject.
(f) Whether the subject’s actions dictate the need for an immediate response and the use
of control devices appears appropriate.
A verbal warning of the intended use of the device should precede its application, unless it would
otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances.
The purpose of the warning is to give the individual a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply
and to warn other officers and individuals that the device is being deployed.
Officers should keep in mind the manufacturer’s recommendations and their training regarding
effective distances and target areas. However, officers are not restricted solely to use according to
manufacturer recommendations. Each situation must be evaluated on the totality of circumstances
at the time of deployment.
The need to immediately incapacitate the subject must be weighed against the risk of causing
serious injury or death. The head and neck should not be intentionally targeted, except when the
officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death
to the officer or others.
303.8.3 SAFETY PROCEDURES
Officers will inspect the launcher and projectiles at the beginning of each shift to ensure that the
launcher is in proper working order and the projectiles are of the approved type and appear to
be free from defects.
When it is not deployed, the launcher will be unloaded and properly and securely stored.
303.9 CROWD CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Pursuant to California Penal Code 13652, kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents shallonly
be deployed by a peace officer that has received training on their proper use by the Commission
on Peace Officer Standards and Training for crowd control if the use is objectivelyreasonable to
defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury to any individual, includingany peace officer,
or to bring an objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely andeffectively under control, and
only in accordance with all of the following requirements:
(a) Deescalation techniques or other alternatives to force have been attempted, when
objectively reasonable, and have failed.
(b) Repeated, audible announcements are made announcing the intent to use kinetic
energy projectiles and chemical agents and the type to be used, when objectively
reasonable to do so. The announcements shall be made from various locations, if
necessary, and delivered in multiple languages, if appropriate.

Control Devices and Techniques
(c) Persons are given an objectively reasonable opportunity to disperse and leave the
scene.
(d) An objectively reasonable effort has been made to identify persons engaged in violent
acts and those who are not, and kinetic energy projectiles or chemical agents are
targeted toward those individuals engaged in violent acts. Projectiles shall not be
aimed indiscriminately into a crowd or group of persons.
(e) Kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents are used only with the frequency,
intensity, and in a manner that is proportional to the threat and objectively reasonable.
(f) Officers shall minimize the possible incidental impact of their use of kinetic energy
projectiles and chemical agents on bystanders, medical personnel, journalists, or other
unintended targets.
(g) An objectively reasonable effort has been made to extract individuals in distress.
(h) Medical assistance is promptly provided, if properly trained personnel are present, or
procured, for injured persons, when it is reasonable and safe to do so.
(i) Kinetic energy projectiles shall not be aimed at the head, neck, or any other vital
organs.
(j) Kinetic energy projectiles or chemical agents shall not be used by any law enforcement
agency solely due to any of the following:
1. A violation of an imposed curfew.
2. A verbal threat.
3. Noncompliance with a law enforcement directive.
As per City Council resolution (June 9, 2020), pepper spray for crowd control by employees ofthe
Berkeley Police Department, or any outside department or agency called to respond to mutual aid
in Berkeley, is prohibited during the COVID-19 pandemic, or until such time as theCity Council
removes the prohibition.
303.10 TRAINING FOR CONTROL DEVICES
The Personnel and Training Sergeant shall ensure that all personnel who are authorized to carry
a control device have been properly trained and certified to carry the specific control device and
are retrained or recertified as necessary.
(a) Proficiency training shall be monitored and documented by a certified, control-device
weapons or tactics instructor.
(b) All training and proficiency for control devices will be documented in the officer’s
training file.
(c) Officers who fail to demonstrate proficiency with the control device or knowledge of
this agency’s Use of Force Policy will be provided remedial training. If an officer cannot
demonstrate proficiency with a control device or knowledge of this agency’s Use of
Force Policy after remedial training, the officer will be restricted from carrying the
control device and may be subject to discipline.

Conducted Energy Device
304.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for requesting a Conducted Energy Device (CED) from an outside
agency and assisting the outside agency if the CED is deployed or discharged.
304.2 POLICY
The Conducted Energy Device (CED) is intended to control a violent or potentially violent
individual, while minimizing the risk of serious injury. The appropriate use of such a device should
result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects.
The use of police CEDs at the request of the Berkeley Police Department may be permitted with
the approval of the Chief of Police or City Manager. Once approved, a CED will only be deployed
by outside agency personnel responding to a request for assistance.
304.3 ISSUANCE AND CARRYING TASER DEVICES
Members of the Berkeley Police Department are currently not issued CEDs and shall not carry
a CED while on duty.
304.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS
When an outside agency has been called in to assist, a verbal warning of the intended use of the
CED should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or
when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to:
(a) Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply.
(b) Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the CED may be deployed.
The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons it was not given shall be
documented by the case officer in the related report.
304.5 USE OF THE CED
The CED has limitations and restrictions requiring consideration before its use. The CED should
only be used when its operator can safely approach the subject within the operational range of the
device. Although the CED is generally effective in controlling most individuals, officers should be
aware that the device may not achieve the intended results and be prepared with other options.
304.5.1 APPLICATION OF THE TASER DEVICE
A CED may be requested (with approval from the Chief of Police or City Manager) when the
circumstances perceived by the officer at the time indicate that such application is reasonably
necessary to control a person. Examples include circumstances wherein:
(a) The subject is violent or is physically resisting.
(b) The subject has demonstrated, by words or action, an intention to be violent or to
physically resist, and reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officers,
him/herself or others.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Conducted Energy Device
Mere flight from a pursuing officer, without other known circumstances or factors, is not good
cause for the use of the CED to apprehend an individual.
304.5.2 SPECIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
The use of the CED on certain individuals should generally be avoided unless the totality of
the circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear ineffective or would
present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes
that the need to control the individual outweighs the risk of using the device. This includes:
(a) Individuals who are known to be pregnant.
(b) Elderly individuals or obvious juveniles.
(c) Individuals with obviously low body mass.
(d) Individuals who are handcuffed or otherwise restrained.
(e) Individuals who have been recently sprayed with a flammable chemical agent or
who are otherwise in close proximity to any known combustible vapor or flammable
material, including alcohol-based oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray.
(f) Individuals whose position or activity may result in collateral injury (e.g., falls from
height, operating vehicles).
304.5.3 ACTIONS FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENTS
Officers shall notify a supervisor of all CED discharges. Confetti tags, the expended cartridge,
along with both probes and wire, should be collected by the outside agency and handled according
to their procedures.
304.5.4 DANGEROUS ANIMALS
The CED may be requested in order to be deployed against an animal as part of a plan to deal
with a potentially dangerous animal, such as a dog, if the animal reasonably appears to pose an
imminent threat to human safety and alternative methods are not reasonably available or would
likely be ineffective.
304.6 DOCUMENTATION
Officers shall document the request for, deployment and/or discharge of a CED in a related police
report.
304.6.1 REPORTS
The officer should include the following in the arrest/crime report:
(a) Identification of all personnel firing TASER devices
(b) Identification of all witnesses
(c) Medical care provided to the subject
(d) Observations of the subject's physical and physiological actions
(e) Any known or suspected drug use, intoxication or other medical problems

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Conducted Energy Device
(f) A "Use of Force" Report is not necessary when an outside agency deploys or
discharges a CED. However, the outside agency may be required to document its use
according to their own policy or procedure.
304.7 MEDICAL TREATMENT
Consistent with local medical personnel protocols and absent extenuating circumstances, only
appropriate medical personnel should remove TASER device probes from a person’s body. Used
TASER device probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, similar to a used hypodermic needle,
and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should be taken.
All persons who have been struck by TASER device probes or who have been subjected to the
electric discharge of the device shall be medically assessed prior to booking. Additionally, any
such individual who falls under any of the following categories should, as soon as practicable, be
examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel:
(a) The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/
or alcohol.
(b) The person may be pregnant.
(c) The person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention.
(d) The TASER device probes are lodged in a sensitive area (e.g., groin, female breast,
head, face, neck).
(e) The person requests medical treatment.
Any individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications
(i.e., more than 15 seconds) shall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically
evaluated prior to booking. If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be
witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related
reports. If an audio recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal
should be included, if possible.
The transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that
the individual has been subjected to the application of the TASER device.
304.8 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
When possible, supervisors should respond to calls when they reasonably believe there is a
likelihood the CED may be used. A supervisor should respond to all incidents where the CED
was activated.
A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to an activation of
the CED. Photographs of probe sites should be taken and witnesses interviewed.

If the vehicle does not have a trunk or a locked container, then the firearm should be locked within
the center utility console that can be locked with a padlock, keylock, combination lock, or other
similar locking device (Penal Code § 25140).
Officers are exempt from these requirements during circumstances requiring immediate aid or
action in the course of official duties (Penal Code § 25140).
306.6 FIREARMS TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS
All members who carry a firearm while on-duty are required to successfully complete training and
qualify with their duty firearms semi-annually. Members will qualify with off-duty and secondary
firearms at least once a year. Training and qualifications must be on an approved range course.
At least annually, all members carrying a firearm should receive practical training designed to
simulate field situations including low-light shooting.
306.6.1 NON-CERTIFICATION OR NON-QUALIFICATION

recorded statement no later than the end of the next regularly scheduled shift, unless
otherwise directed by a supervisor.
306.7.1 DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS
Members are authorized to use firearms to stop an animal in circumstances where the animal
reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat to human safety and alternative methods are
not reasonably available or would likely be ineffective. When practical members should seek
supervisor approval prior to using a firearm to destroy an animal.
In circumstances where there is sufficient advance notice that a potentially dangerous animal may
be encountered, department members should develop reasonable contingency plans for dealing
with the animal (e.g., fire extinguisher, TASER® device, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, animal
control officer). Nothing in this policy shall prohibit any member from shooting a dangerous animal
if circumstances reasonably dictate that a contingency plan has failed or becomes impractical.
306.7.2 INJURED ANIMALS
A member may euthanize an animal that is so badly injured that human compassion requires
its removal from further suffering and where other dispositions are impractical (Penal Code §
597.1(e)). When practical members should seek supervisor approval prior to using a firearm to
destroy an animal.
Injured animals (with the exception of dogs and cats) may only be euthanized after a reasonable
search to locate the owner has been made (Penal Code § 597.1(b)). Injured dogs and cats found
without their owners shall be taken to an appropriate veterinarian for determination of whether
they should be treated or humanely destroyed.
306.8 PERSONNEL AND TRAINING SERGEANT DUTIES
The range will be under the exclusive control of the FTU Staff. All members attending will follow
the directions of the FTU. The FTU Staff will maintain a roster of all members attending the range
and will submit the roster to the Personnel and Training Sergeant or his or her designee after each
range date. Failure of any member to sign in may result in non-qualification.
The range shall remain operational and accessible to Department members during hours
established by the Department.
The Department Armorers have the responsibility of making periodic inspection, at least once a
year, of all duty firearms carried by members of this department to verify proper operation. The
Personnel and Training Sergeant or their designee has the authority to deem any department-
issued or personally owned firearm unfit for service. The member will be responsible for all repairs
to his/her personally owned firearm and it will not be returned to service until inspected by the
Department Armorer.

The FTU Staff have the responsibility for ensuring each member meets the minimum requirements
during training shoots and, on at least a semi-annual basis, can demonstrate proficiency in the
care, cleaning and safety of all firearms the member is authorized to carry.
The FTU Staff shall complete and submit to the Personnel and Training Sergeant documentation
of the training courses provided. Documentation shall include a description of the training provided
and, on a form that has been approved by the Department, a list of each member who completes
the training. The Personnel and Training Sergeant or his or her designee should keep accurate
records of all training shoots, qualifications, repairs, maintenance or other records.
306.9 FLYING WHILE ARMED
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has imposed rules governing law enforcement
officers flying armed on commercial aircraft. The following requirements apply to officers who
intend to be armed while flying on a commercial air carrier or flights where screening is conducted
(49 CFR 1544.219):
(a) Officers wishing to fly while armed must be flying in an official capacity, not for vacation
or pleasure, and must have a need to have the firearm accessible, as determined by
the Department based on the law and published TSA rules.
(b) Officers must carry their Berkeley Police Department identification card, bearing the
officer’s name, a full-face photograph, identification number, the officer’s signature
and the signature of the Chief of Police or the official seal of the Department and must
present this identification to airline officials when requested. The officer should also
carry the standard photo identification needed for passenger screening by airline and
TSA officials (e.g., driver license, passport).
(c) The Berkeley Police Department must submit a National Law Enforcement
Telecommunications System (NLETS) message prior to the officer’s travel. If
approved, TSA will send the Berkeley Police Department an NLETS message
containing a unique alphanumeric identifier. The officer must present the message on
the day of travel to airport personnel as authorization to travel while armed.
(d) An official letter signed by the Chief of Police authorizing armed travel may also
accompany the officer. The letter should outline the officer’s need to fly armed, detail
his/her itinerary, and include that the officer has completed the mandatory TSA training
for a law enforcement officer flying while armed.
(e) Officers must have completed the mandated TSA security training covering officers
flying while armed. The training shall be given by the department-appointed instructor.
(f) It is the officer’s responsibility to notify the air carrier in advance of the intended
armed travel. This notification should be accomplished by early check-in at the carrier’s
check-in counter.
(g) Any officer flying while armed should discreetly contact the flight crew prior to take-off
and notify them of his/her assigned seat.
(h) Discretion must be used to avoid alarming passengers or crew by displaying a
firearm. The officer must keep the firearm concealed on his/her person at all times.

flight captain, ground security manager, TSA representative or other management
representative of the air carrier.
(j) Officers shall not consume alcoholic beverages while aboard an aircraft, or within eight
hours prior to boarding an aircraft.
306.10 CARRYING FIREARMS OUT OF STATE
Qualified, active, full-time officers of this department are authorized to carry a concealed firearm
in all other states subject to the following conditions (18 USC § 926B):
(a) The officer shall carry his/her Berkeley Police Department identification card whenever
carrying such firearm.
(b) The officer is not the subject of any current disciplinary action that prohibits them from
carrying a firearm.
(c) The officer may not be under the influence of alcohol or any other intoxicating or
hallucinatory drug.
(d) The officer will remain subject to this and all other department policies (including
qualifying and training).

Law Enforcement Manual
Canines
308.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes guidelines for the use of canines to augment police services to the
community including, but not limited to locating missing or at risk individuals and apprehending
criminal offenders.
308.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department that a request for canine unit assistance from an
outside agency only be used to effectively and reasonably carry out legitimate law enforcement
objectives
Per the 1982 Berkeley City Council Resolution (51,408 NS), police use of canines from other law
enforcement agencies is permitted upon approval of the City Manager (or upon approval of the
Chief of Police in emergency situations when the City Manager is not immediately available) in
the following circumstances:
(a) To apprehend a suspect where there is a threat to human life, the suspect is
reasonably believed to be armed with a deadly weapon and the suspect is in a
controlled, contained area and there are no known occupants of the area other than
the suspect; or
(b) To locate missing persons; or
(c) To locate crime scenes.
The use of canines in crowd control is explicitly prohibited.
308.3 APPREHENSION GUIDELINES
A canine may be used to locate and apprehend a suspect if:
(a) The on-scene supervisor or Watch Commander reasonably believes that the individual
has either committed, is committing or is threatening to commit any serious offense
and
(b) If the suspect is believed to be concealed in an area where entry by other than the
canine would pose a threat to the safety of officers or the public.
It is recognized that situations may arise that do not fall within the provisions set forth in this policy.
Such events require consideration of the totality of the circumstances and the use of an objective
reasonableness standard applied to the decision to use a canine
Absent a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed, is committing or is threatening to commit
a serious offense, mere flight from a pursuing officer, without any of the above conditions, shall
not serve as the basis for the use of a canine to apprehend a suspect.
In all applications, once the suspect has been located and no longer reasonably appears to present
a threat or risk of escape, officers should confirm the handler secures the canine as soon as it
becomes reasonably practicable.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Canines
If the canine has apprehended the suspect with a secure bite, and officers believe that the suspect
no longer poses a threat, officers should request the handler, if not done already, command the
canine to release the suspect.
308.4 PREPARATION FOR DEPLOYMENT
Prior to the use of a canine to search for or apprehend any suspect, the on-scene supervisor
should carefully consider all pertinent information reasonably available at the time. The information
should include, but is not limited to:
(a) The nature and seriousness of the suspected offense.
(b) Whether violence or weapons were used or are anticipated.
(c) The degree of resistance or threatened resistance, if any, the suspect has shown.
(d) The suspect’s known or perceived age.
(e) The potential for injury to officers or the public caused by the suspect if the canine
is not utilized.
(f) Any potential danger to the public and/or other officers at the scene if the canine is
released.
(g) The potential for the suspect to escape or flee if the canine is not utilized.
As circumstances permit, the on-scene supervisor should make every reasonable effort to
communicate with the canine handler and coordinate with other involved members to minimize
the risk of unintended injury.
It is the canine handler’s responsibility to evaluate each situation and determine whether the use
of a canine is appropriate and reasonable. The canine handler shall have the authority to decline
the use of the canine whenever he/she deems deployment is unsuitable.
A supervisor who is sufficiently apprised of the situation may prohibit deploying the canine.
Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor, assisting members should take direction from the
handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.
308.5 WARNINGS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS
Unless it would increase the risk of injury or escape, a clearly audible warning announcing that a
canine will be used if the suspect does not surrender should be made prior to releasing a canine.
Officers should allow a reasonable time for a suspect to surrender and should request the handler
quiet the canine momentarily in order to listen for any verbal response to the warning. If feasible,
other members should be in a location opposite the warning to verify that the announcement could
be heard. If available, warnings given in other languages should be used as necessary.
In the event of an apprehension, the handling officer shall document in any related report how the
warning was given and, if none was given, the reasons why.

Canines
308.6 REPORTING DEPLOYMENTS, BITES AND INJURIES
Whenever a canine deployment results in a bite or causes injury to an intended suspect, a
supervisor should be promptly notified. The injured person shall be promptly treated by emergency
medical services personnel and, if appropriate, transported to an appropriate medical facility for
further treatment. The deployment and injuries should also be included in any related incident or
arrest report.
308.7 NON-APPREHENSION GUIDELINES
Properly trained canines may also be used to track or search for non-criminals (e.g., lost children,
individuals who may be disoriented or in need of medical attention). The Watch Commander is
responsible for determining a canine’s suitability for such assignments based on the conditions
and the particular abilities of the canine. When the canine is deployed in a search or other non-
apprehension operation, the following guidelines apply.
(a) Absent a change in circumstances that present an immediate threat to officers,
the canine or the public, such applications should be conducted on-leash or under
conditions that minimize the likelihood the canine will bite or otherwise injure the
individual, if located.
(b) Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor, assisting members should take direction
from the handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.
308.8 BOMB/EXPLOSIVE DETECTION
Because of the high risk of danger to the public and officers when a bomb or other explosive
device is suspected, the use of a canine team trained in explosive detection may be considered.
When available, an explosive-detection canine team may be used in accordance with current law
and under certain circumstances, including:
(a) Assisting in the search of a building, structure, area, vehicle or article where an actual
or suspected explosive device has been reported or located.
(b) Assisting with searches at transportation facilities and vehicles (e.g., buses, airplanes,
trains).
(c) Preventive searches at special events, VIP visits, official buildings and other restricted
areas. Searches of individuals should remain minimally intrusive and shall be strictly
limited to the purpose of detecting explosives.
(d) Assisting in the search of scenes where an explosion has occurred and an explosive
device or secondary explosive device is suspected.
At no time will an explosive-detection trained canine be used to render a suspected device safe
or clear.

Officer Response to Calls
309.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides for the safe and appropriate response to emergency and non-emergency
situations whether dispatched or self-initiated.
309.2 RESPONSE TO CALLS
Officers dispatched "Code-3" shall consider the call an emergency response and proceed
immediately. Officers responding Code-3 shall continuously operate emergency lighting
equipment, including at minimum a steady forward facing red light, and shall sound the siren as
reasonably necessary pursuant to Vehicle Code § 21055.
Responding with emergency light(s) and siren does not relieve the officer of the duty to continue
to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons. The use of any other warning equipment
without a red light and siren does not provide any exemption from the Vehicle Code.
Officers should only respond Code-3 when so dispatched or when circumstances reasonably
indicate an emergency response is required. Officers not authorized to respond Code-3 shall
observe all traffic laws and proceed without the use of emergency lights and siren.
309.3 RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESPONDING OFFICERS
Officers shall exercise sound judgment and care with due regard for life and property when
responding to an emergency call. Officers shall reduce speed at all street intersections to such a
degree that they shall have complete control of the vehicle.
The decision to continue a Code-3 response is at the discretion of the officer. If, in the officer's
judgment, the roadway conditions or traffic congestion does not permit such a response without
unreasonable risk, the officer may elect to respond to the call without the use of red lights and
siren at the legal speed limit. An officer shall also discontinue the Code-3 response when directed
by a supervisor.
309.4 COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES
A dispatcher shall assign a Code-3 response when an officer requests emergency assistance or
available information reasonably indicates that the public is threatened with serious injury or death
and immediate police response is needed. The dispatcher shall:
(a) Attempt to assign the closest available unit to the location requiring assistance
(b) Confirm and repeat the location where the Code-3 response is needed
(c) Notify and coordinate allied emergency services (e.g., fire and ambulance)
(d) Continue to obtain and broadcast information as necessary concerning the response
and monitor the situation until it is stabilized or terminated
(e) Control all radio communications during the emergency and coordinate assistance
under the direction of the Watch Commander or field supervisor

Officer Response to Calls
309.5 SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon being notified that a Code-3 response has been initiated, the Watch Commander or the field
supervisor shall verify the following:
(a) The proper response has been initiated
(b) No more than those units reasonably necessary under the circumstances are involved
in the response
(c) Affected outside jurisdictions are being notified as practical
The field supervisor shall monitor the response until it has been stabilized or terminated and assert
control by directing units into or out of the response if necessary. If, in the supervisor's judgment,
the circumstances require additional units to be assigned a Code-3 response, the supervisor may
do so.
It is the supervisor's responsibility to terminate a Code-3 response that, in his/her judgment is
inappropriate due to the circumstances.
When making the decision to authorize a Code-3 response, the Watch Commander or the field
supervisor should consider the following:
• The type of call
• The necessity of a timely response
• Traffic and roadway conditions
• The location of the responding units
309.6 FAILURE OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT
If the emergency equipment on the vehicle should fail to operate, the officer must terminate
the Code-3 response and respond accordingly. In all cases, the officer shall notify the Watch
Commander, field supervisor, or the Communications Center of the equipment failure so that
another unit may be assigned to the emergency response.

Law Enforcement Manual
Domestic Violence
310.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide the guidelines necessary to deter, prevent and reduce
domestic violence through vigorous enforcement and to address domestic violence as a serious
crime against society. This policy specifically addresses the commitment of this department to
take enforcement action when appropriate, to provide assistance to victims and to guide officers
in the investigation of domestic violence.
310.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Court order - All forms of orders related to domestic violence that have been issued by a court
of this state or another, whether civil or criminal, regardless of whether service has been made.
310.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department’s response to incidents of domestic violence and violations of
related court orders shall stress enforcement of the law to protect the victim and shall communicate
the philosophy that domestic violence is criminal behavior. It is also the policy of this department
to facilitate victims’ and offenders’ access to appropriate civil remedies and community resources
whenever feasible. In order to break the cycle of violence, the department policy is pro-arrest and
focuses on proving the case with or without the victim’s cooperation whenever possible.
310.3 OFFICER SAFETY
The investigation of domestic violence cases often places officers in emotionally charged and
sometimes highly dangerous environments. No provision of this policy is intended to supersede
the responsibility of all officers to exercise due caution and reasonable care in providing for the
safety of any officers and parties involved.
310.4 INVESTIGATIONS
The following guidelines should be followed by officers when investigating domestic violence
cases:
(a) Calls of reported, threatened, imminent, or ongoing domestic violence and the violation
of any court order are of extreme importance and should be considered among the
highest response priorities. This includes incomplete 9-1-1 calls.
(b) When practicable, officers should obtain and document statements from the victim, the
suspect, and any witnesses, including children, in or around the household or location
of occurrence.
(c) Officers should list the full name and date of birth (and school if available) of each
child who was present in the household at the time of the offense. The names of other
children who may not have been in the house at that particular time should also be
obtained for follow-up.

(d) When practicable and legally permitted, video or audio record all significant statements
and observations.
(e) All injuries should be photographed, regardless of severity, taking care to preserve
the victim’s personal privacy. Where practicable, photographs should be taken by a
person of the same sex. Victims whose injuries are not visible at the time of the incident
should be asked to contact the Detective Bureau in the event that the injuries later
become visible.
(f) Officers should request that the victim complete and sign an authorization for release
of medical records related to the incident when applicable.
(g) If the suspect is no longer at the scene, officers should make reasonable efforts to
locate the suspect to further the investigation, provide the suspect with an opportunity
to make a statement, and make an arrest or seek an arrest warrant if appropriate.
(h) Seize any firearms or other dangerous weapons in the home, if appropriate and legally
permitted, for safekeeping or as evidence. If the domestic violence involved threats
of bodily harm, any firearm discovered in plain view or pursuant to consent or other
lawful search must be taken into temporary custody (Penal Code § 18250).
(i) When completing an incident or arrest report for violation of a court order, officers
should include specific information that establishes that the offender has been served,
including the date the offender was served, the name of the agency that served the
order, and the provision of the order that the subject is alleged to have violated. When
reasonably available, the arresting officer should attach a copy of the order to the
incident or arrest report.
(j) Officers should take appropriate enforcement action when there is probable cause to
believe an offense has occurred. Factors that should not be used as sole justification
for declining to take enforcement action include:
1. Whether the suspect lives on the premises with the victim.
2. Claims by the suspect that the victim provoked or perpetuated the violence.
3. The potential financial or child custody consequences of arrest.
4. The physical or emotional state of either party.
5. Use of drugs or alcohol by either party.
6. Denial that the abuse occurred where evidence indicates otherwise.
7. A request by the victim not to arrest the suspect.
8. Location of the incident (public/private).
9. Speculation that the complainant may not follow through with the prosecution.
10. Actual or perceived characteristics such as race, ethnicity, national origin,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, economic status,
age, cultural group, disability, or marital status of the victim or suspect.
11. The social status, community status, or professional position of the victim or
suspect.

310.4.1 IF A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED
If a suspect is arrested, officers should:
(a) Advise the victim that there is no guarantee the suspect will remain in custody.
(b) Provide the victim’s contact information to the jail staff to enable notification of the
victim upon the suspect’s release from jail.
(c) Advise the victim whether any type of court order will be in effect when the suspect
is released from jail.
310.4.2 IF NO ARREST IS MADE
If no arrest is made, the officer should:
(a) Advise the parties of any options, including but not limited to:
1. Voluntary separation of the parties.
2. Appropriate resource referrals (e.g., counselors, friends, relatives, shelter
homes, victim witness unit).
(b) Document the resolution in a report.
310.5 VICTIM ASSISTANCE
Because victims may be traumatized or confused, officers should be aware that a victim's behavior
and actions may be affected:
(a) Victims should be provided with the department's domestic violence information
handout, even if the incident may not rise to the level of a crime.
(b) Victims should also be alerted to any available victim advocates, shelters, and
community resources.
(c) When an involved person requests law enforcement assistance while removing
essential items of personal property, officers should stand by for a reasonable amount
of time.
(d) If the victim has sustained injury or complaints of pain, officers should seek medical
assistance as soon as practicable.
(e) Officers should ask the victim whether the victim has a safe place to stay and assist
in arranging transportation to an alternate shelter if the victim expresses a concern for
the victim's safety or if the officer determines that a need exists.
(f) Officers should make reasonable efforts to ensure that children or dependent adults
who are under the supervision of the suspect or victim are being properly cared for.
(g) If appropriate, officers should seek or assist the victim in obtaining an emergency order
if appropriate.
An officer shall advise an individual protected by a Canadian domestic violence protection order
of available local victim services (Family Code § 6452).

310.6 DISPATCH ASSISTANCE
All calls of domestic violence, including incomplete 9-1-1 calls, should be dispatched as soon as
practicable.
Dispatchers are not required to verify the validity of a court order before responding to a request for
assistance. Officers should request that dispatchers check whether any of the involved persons
are subject to the terms of a court order.
310.7 FOREIGN COURT ORDERS
Various types of orders may be issued in domestic violence cases. Any foreign court order properly
issued by a court of another state, Indian tribe or territory shall be enforced by officers as if it
were the order of a court in this state. An order should be considered properly issued when it
reasonably appears that the issuing court has jurisdiction over the parties and reasonable notice
and opportunity to respond was given to the party against whom the order was issued (18 USC
§ 2265). An otherwise valid out-of-state court order shall be enforced, regardless of whether the
order has been properly registered with this state.
Canadian domestic violence protection orders shall also be enforced in the same manner as if
issued in this state (Family Code § 6452).
310.8 VERIFICATION OF COURT ORDERS
Determining the validity of a court order, particularly an order from another jurisdiction, can be
challenging. Therefore, in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest for a
violation of any court order, officers should carefully review the actual order when available, and
where appropriate and practicable:
(a) Ask the subject of the order about his/her notice or receipt of the order, his/her
knowledge of its terms and efforts to respond to the order.
1. If a determination is made that a valid foreign order cannot be enforced because
the subject has not been notified or served the order, the officer shall inform
the subject of the order, make a reasonable effort to serve the order upon the
subject, and allow the subject a reasonable opportunity to comply with the order
before enforcing the order. Verbal notice of the terms of the order is sufficient
notice (Family Code § 6403).
(b) Check available records or databases that may show the status or conditions of the
order.
1. Registration or filing of an order in California is not required for the enforcement
of a valid foreign order (Family Code § 6403).
(c) Contact the issuing court to verify the validity of the order.
(d) Contact a law enforcement official from the jurisdiction where the order was issued
to verify information.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Domestic Violence - 111

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Domestic Violence
Officers should document in an appropriate report their efforts to verify the validity of an order,
regardless of whether an arrest is made. Officers should contact a supervisor for clarification when
needed.
310.9 STANDARDS FOR ARRESTS
Officers investigating a domestic violence report should consider the following:
(a) An arrest should be made when there is probable cause to believe that a felony or
misdemeanor domestic violence offense has been committed (Penal Code § 13701).
Any decision to not arrest an adult when there is probable cause to do so requires
supervisor approval.
1. Officers are only authorized to make an arrest without a warrant for a
misdemeanor domestic violence offense if the officer makes the arrest as soon
as probable cause arises (Penal Code § 836).
(b) An officer responding to a domestic violence call who cannot make an arrest will advise
the victim of the victim's right to make a private person's arrest. The advisement should
be made out of the presence of the suspect and shall include advising the victim how
to safely execute the arrest. Officers shall not dissuade victims from making a lawful
private person's arrest. Officers should refer to the provisions in the Private Persons
Arrests Policy for options regarding the disposition of private person's arrests (Penal
Code § 836(b)).
(c) Officers shall not cite and release a person for the following offenses (Penal Code §
853.6(a)(3)):
1. Penal Code § 243(e)(1) (battery against spouse, cohabitant)
2. Penal Code § 273.5 (corporal injury on spouse, cohabitant, fiancé/fiancée,
person of a previous dating or engagement relationship, mother/father of the
offender's child)
3. Penal Code § 273.6 (violation of protective order) if violence or threats of
violence have occurred or the suspect has gone to the workplace or residence
of the protected party
4. Penal Code § 646.9 (stalking)
5. Other serious or violent felonies specified in Penal Code § 1270.1
(d) In responding to domestic violence incidents, including mutual protective order
violations, officers should generally be reluctant to make dual arrests. Officers shall
make reasonable efforts to identify the dominant aggressor in any incident. The
dominant aggressor is the person who has been determined to be the most significant,
rather than the first, aggressor (Penal Code § 13701). In identifying the dominant
aggressor, an officer shall consider:
1. The intent of the law to protect victims of domestic violence from continuing
abuse.
2. The threats creating fear of physical injury.
3. The history of domestic violence between the persons involved.

Domestic Violence
4. Whether either person acted in self-defense.
(e) An arrest shall be made when there is probable cause to believe that a violation of a
domestic violence court order has been committed (Penal Code § 13701; Penal Code
§ 836), regardless of whether the offense was committed in the officer's presence.
After arrest, the officer shall confirm that a copy of the order has been registered,
unless the victim provides a copy (Penal Code § 836).
310.10 REPORTS AND RECORDS
(a) A written report shall be completed on all incidents of domestic violence. All such
reports should be documented on the appropriate form, which includes information
and notations specific to domestic violence incidents as required by Penal Code §
13730.
(b) Reporting officers should provide the victim with the case number of the report. The
case number may be placed in the space provided on the domestic violence victim
information handout provided to the victim. If the case number is not immediately
available, an explanation should be given regarding how the victim can obtain the
information at a later time.
(c) Officers who seize any firearm, ammunition, or other deadly weapon in a domestic
violence incident shall issue the individual possessing such weapon a receipt that
includes the name and residential mailing address of the owner or person who
possessed the weapon and notice of where the weapon may be recovered, along with
the applicable time limit for recovery (Penal Code § 18250; Penal Code § 18255; Penal
Code § 33800; Family Code § 6389(c)).
310.11 RECORD-KEEPING AND DATA COLLECTION
This department shall maintain records of court orders related to domestic violence and the service
status of each (Penal Code § 13710), as well as records on the number of domestic violence
related calls reported to the Department, including whether weapons were used in the incident or
whether the incident involved strangulation or suffocation (Penal Code § 13730). This information
is to be reported to the Attorney General monthly. It shall be the responsibility of the Records
Supervisor to maintain and report this information as required.
310.12 SERVICE OF COURT ORDERS
(a) An officer who obtains an emergency protective order from the court shall serve it on
the restrained person if the person can be reasonably located and shall provide the
person protected or the person's parent/guardian with a copy of the order. The officer
shall file a copy with the court as soon as practicable and shall have the order entered
into the computer database system for protective and restraining orders maintained
by the Department of Justice (Family Code § 6271; Penal Code § 646.91).
(b) At the request of the petitioner, an officer at the scene of a reported domestic violence
incident shall serve a court order on a restrained person (Family Code § 6383; Penal
Code § 13710).

Domestic Violence
(c) Any officer serving a protective order that indicates that the respondent possesses
weapons or ammunition shall request that the firearm/ammunition be immediately
surrendered (Family Code § 6389(c)).
(d) During the service of a protective order any firearm discovered in plain view or pursuant
to consent or other lawful search shall be taken into temporary custody (Penal Code
§ 18250).
(e) If a valid Canadian order cannot be enforced because the person subject to the order
has not been notified or served with the order, the officer shall notify the protected
individual that reasonable efforts shall be made to contact the person subject to the
order. The officer shall make a reasonable effort to inform the person subject to the
order of the existence and terms of the order and provide the person with a record of
the order, if available, and shall allow the person a reasonable opportunity to comply
with the order before taking enforcement action (Family Code § 6452).
310.13 PUBLIC ACCESS TO POLICY
A copy of this domestic violence policy will be provided to members of the public upon request
(Penal Code § 13701).
310.14 DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF BAIL INCREASE
Any officer who makes a warrantless arrest for a felony or misdemeanor violation of a domestic
violence restraining order shall evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine whether
reasonable cause exists to seek an increased bail amount. If there is reasonable cause to believe
that the scheduled bail amount is insufficient to assure the arrestee's appearance or to protect the
victim or family member of a victim, the officer shall prepare a declaration in support of increased
bail (Penal Code § 1269c).

Law Enforcement Manual
Search and Seizure
311.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Both the federal and state Constitutions provide every individual with the right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures. This policy provides general guidelines for Berkeley Police
Department personnel to consider when dealing with search and seizure issues.
311.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to respect the fundamental privacy rights
of individuals. Members of this department will conduct searches in strict observance of the
constitutional rights of persons being searched. All seizures by this department will comply with
relevant federal and state law governing the seizure of persons and property.
The Department will provide relevant and current training to officers as guidance for the application
of current law, local community standards and prosecutorial considerations regarding specific
search and seizure situations, as appropriate.
311.3 SEARCHES
The U.S. Constitution generally provides that a valid warrant is required in order for a search to
be valid. There are, however, several exceptions that permit a warrantless search.
Examples of law enforcement activities that are exceptions to the general warrant requirement
include, but are not limited to, searches pursuant to the following:
• Valid consent
• Incident to a lawful arrest
• Legitimate community caretaking interests
• Vehicle searches under certain circumstances
• Exigent circumstances
Certain other activities are recognized by federal and state courts and by certain statutes as
legitimate law enforcement activities that also do not require a warrant. Such activities may include
seizure and examination of abandoned property, and observations of activities and property
located on open public areas.
Because case law regarding search and seizure is constantly changing and subject to
interpretation by the courts, each member of this department is expected to act in each situation
according to current training and his/her familiarity with clearly established rights as determined
by case law.
Officers seeking a consent search should obtain written consent on a Berkeley Police Department
Consent Search Form, unless an officers safety or exigency issue exists. When either of the
aforementioned exist, the officer shall obtain the consent on body worn camera (BWC) and
document the reason in the MDT/incident/case report.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Search and Seizure
Whenever practicable, officers are encouraged to contact a supervisor to resolve questions
regarding search and seizure issues prior to electing a course of action.
311.4 SEARCH PROTOCOL
Although conditions will vary and officer safety and other exigencies must be considered in every
search situation, the following guidelines should be followed whenever circumstances permit:
(a) Members of this department will strive to conduct searches with dignity and courtesy.
(b) Officers should explain to the person being searched the reason for the search.
(c) Searches should be carried out with due regard and respect for private property
interests and in a manner that minimizes damage. Property should be left in a condition
as close as reasonably possible to its pre-search condition.
(d) In order to minimize the need for forcible entry, an attempt should be made to obtain
keys, combinations or access codes when a search of locked property is anticipated.
(e) When the person to be searched is of the opposite sex as the searching officer, a
reasonable effort should be made to summon an officer of the same sex as the subject
to conduct the search. When it is not practicable to summon an officer of the same
sex as the subject, the following guidelines should be followed:
1. Another officer or a supervisor should witness the search.
2. The officer should not search areas of the body covered by tight-fitting clothing,
sheer clothing or clothing that could not reasonably conceal a weapon.
311.5 ASKING IF A PERSON IS ON PROBATION OR PAROLE
In an effort to foster community trust, officers should not ask if a person is on probation or
parole when a person has satisfactorily identified themselves, either verbally or by presenting
identification documents.
Officers may determine probation or parole status through standard records checks conducted in
the course of a traffic safety or investigative stop. Officers should only ask when necessary to:
(a) Protect the safety of others, the person detained, or officers;
(b) Further a specific law enforcement investigative purpose (for example, sorting out multiple
computer returns on a common name);
(c) To confirm probation and parole status subsequent to a records check.
If an officer needs to ask the question, “Are you on probation or parole?” the officer should do so
while treating the person with dignity and respect, and being mindful that people may take offense
at the question.
311.6 WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF INDIVIDUALS ON SUPERVISED RELEASE
SEARCH CONDITIONS
In accordance with California law, individuals on probation, parole, Post Release Community
Supervision, or other supervised release status may be subject to warrantless search as a

condition of their probation. Officers shall only conduct probation or parole searches to further a
legitimate law enforcement purpose or rehabilitative purpose. Searches shall not be conducted in
an arbitrary, capricious, or harassing fashion.
Individuals contacted or detained who are found to be on searchable Supervised Release for
1
Violent Offenses may be searched pursuant to the terms of their Supervised Release conditions.
The decision to detain a person and conduct a probation or parole search, or otherwise enforce
2
probation or parole conditions for those on supervised release for nonviolent crimes , should be
made, at a minimum, in connection with articulable facts that create a reasonable suspicion that
a person may have committed a crime, be committing a crime, or be about to commit a crime
or which demonstrate that the individual is connected in some way to criminal activity or that the
individual is an imminent threat to officer or citizen safety. In the conduct of all such detentions and
searches, officers shall consciously avoid the application of bias, shall not use such detentions or
searches as a means to harass or annoy, and shall not conduct such detentions and searches in
a manner that targets or is discriminatory toward any protected class.
1. Offenses involving the use of force, the threat of force, the use or possession of
a weapon, sexual violations against the person of another, human trafficking, and
the use of force or threats to public safety. Battery on a Peace Officer (Penal Code
§ 243(b)), Reckless Evasion in a Vehicle (Vehicle Code § 2800.2(a)), or a violent
felony as defined in Penal Code § 667.5(c).), fall into the categories of violent crimes,
weapons offenses, sex crimes and/or crimes involving threats to public safety in
accordance with state law.
2. "Non-Violent Offenses" are defined as offenses in which violence or use of a weapon
or threat to life safety is not a factor.
311.7 DOCUMENTATION
Officers shall document, via MDT disposition, Field Interview, Incident or Case Report, any search
of a person, vehicle or location. Officers should consider documenting, as applicable, the following:
• Reason for the search
• Any efforts used to minimize the intrusiveness of any search (e.g., asking for consent
or keys)
• What, if any, injuries or damage occurred
• All steps taken to secure property
• The results of the search, including a description of any property or contraband seized
• If the person searched is the opposite sex, any efforts to summon an officer of the
same sex as the person being searched and the identification of any witness officer
Supervisors shall review reports to ensure the reports are accurate, that actions are properly
documented and that current legal requirements and department policy have been met.

Temporary Custody of Juveniles
312.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines consistent with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
Act for juveniles taken into temporary custody by members of the Berkeley Police Department
(34 USC § 11133).
Guidance regarding contacting juveniles at schools or who may be victims is provided in the Child
Abuse Policy.
312.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Juvenile non-offender - An abused, neglected, dependent, or alien juvenile who may be legally
held for his/her own safety or welfare. This also includes any juvenile who may have initially been
contacted for an offense that would not subject an adult to arrest (e.g., fine-only offense) but was
taken into custody for his/her protection or for purposes of reuniting the juvenile with a parent,
guardian, or other responsible person. Juveniles 11 years of age or younger are considered
juvenile non-offenders even if they have committed an offense that would subject an adult to arrest.
Juvenile offender - A juvenile 12 to 17 years of age who is alleged to have committed an offense
that would subject an adult to arrest (a non-status offense) (Welfare and Institutions Code § 602).
It also includes an offense under Penal Code § 29610 for underage possession of a handgun or
concealable firearm (28 CFR 31.303).
Non-secure custody - When a juvenile is held in the presence of an officer or other custody
employee at all times and is not placed in a locked room, cell, or behind any locked doors. Juveniles
in non-secure custody may be handcuffed but not to a stationary or secure object. Personal
supervision, through direct visual monitoring and audio two-way communication is maintained.
Monitoring through electronic devices, such as video, does not replace direct visual observation
(Welfare and Institutions Code § 207.1; 15 CCR 1150).
Safety checks - Direct, visual observation personally by a member of this department performed
at random intervals within time frames prescribed in this policy to provide for the health and welfare
of juveniles in temporary custody.
Secure custody - When a juvenile offender is held in a locked room, a set of rooms, or a cell.
Secure custody also includes being physically secured to a stationary object (15 CCR 1146).
Sight and sound separation - Located or arranged to prevent physical, visual, or auditory contact
that is more than brief or inadvertent.
Status offender - A juvenile suspected of committing a criminal violation of the law that would
not be a criminal violation but for the age of the offender. Examples may include running away,
underage possession of tobacco, curfew violation, and truancy. A juvenile in custody on a
court order or warrant based upon a status offense is also a status offender. This includes the

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Temporary Custody of Juveniles
habitually disobedient or truant juvenile under Welfare and Institutions Code § 601 and any juvenile
suspected of an offense that would not subject an adult to arrest (e.g., fine-only offense).
312.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to releasing juveniles from temporary custody as
soon as reasonably practicable and keeping juveniles safe while they are in temporary custody at
the Berkeley Police Department. Juveniles should be held in temporary custody only for as long
as reasonably necessary for processing, transfer or release.
312.3 JUVENILES WHO SHOULD NOT BE HELD
Juveniles who exhibit any of the following conditions should not be held at the Berkeley Police
Department:
(a) Unconscious
(b) Seriously injured
(c) A known suicide risk or obviously severely emotionally disturbed
(d) Significantly intoxicated except when approved by the Watch Commander. A medical
clearance shall be obtained for minors who are under the influence of drugs, alcohol
or any other intoxicating substance to the extent that they are unable to care for
themselves (15 CCR 1151).
(e) Extremely violent or continuously violent
Officers taking custody of a juvenile who exhibits any of the above conditions should take
reasonable steps to provide medical attention or mental health assistance and notify a supervisor
of the situation (15 CCR 1142; 15 CCR 1151).
These juveniles should not be held at the Berkeley Police Department unless they have been
evaluated by a qualified medical and/or mental health professional (15 CCR 1142).
If the officer taking custody of the juvenile believes the juvenile may be a suicide risk, the juvenile
shall be under continuous direct supervision until evaluation, release or a transfer is completed
(15 CCR 1142).
312.3.1 EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE OF JUVENILES IN CUSTODY
When emergency medical attention is required for a juvenile, medical assistance will be called
immediately. The Watch Commander shall be notified of the need for medical attention for the
juvenile. Department members should administer first aid as applicable (15 CCR 1142).
312.3.2 SUICIDE PREVENTION OF JUVENILES IN CUSTODY
Department members should be alert to potential symptoms based upon exhibited behavior that
may indicate the juvenile is a suicide risk. These symptoms may include depression, refusal to
communicate, verbally threatening to kill him/herself or any unusual behavior which may indicate
the juvenile may harm him/herself while in either secure or non-secure custody (15 CCR 1142).

312.4 CUSTODY OF JUVENILES
Officers should take custody of a juvenile and temporarily hold the juvenile at the Berkeley Police
Department when there is no other lawful and practicable alternative to temporary custody. Refer
to the Child Abuse Policy for additional information regarding detaining a juvenile that is suspected
of being a victim.
No juvenile should be held in temporary custody at the Berkeley Police Department without
authorization of the arresting officer's supervisor or the Watch Commander. Juveniles taken into
custody shall be held in non-secure custody unless otherwise authorized by this policy.
Any juvenile taken into custody shall be released to the care of the juvenile’s parent or other
responsible adult or transferred to a juvenile custody facility or to other authority as soon as
practicable and in no event shall a juvenile be held beyond six hours from the time of his/her entry
into the Berkeley Police Department (34 USC § 11133; Welfare and Institutions Code § 207.1).
312.4.1 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE NON-OFFENDERS
Non-offenders taken into protective custody in compliance with the Child Abuse Policy should
generally not be held at the Berkeley Police Department. Custodial arrangements should be made
for non-offenders as soon as reasonably possible. Juvenile non-offenders shall not be held in
secure custody (34 USC § 11133; Welfare and Institutions Code § 206).
Juveniles 11 years of age or younger who have committed an offense that would subject an adult
to arrest may be held in non-secure custody for the offenses listed in Welfare and Institutions
Code § 602(b) (murder and the sexual assault offenses) and should be referred to a probation
officer for a placement determination (Welfare and Institutions Code § 602.1).
312.4.2 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE STATUS OFFENDERS
Status offenders (e.g. runaways) should generally be released by citation or with a warning rather
than taken into temporary custody. However, officers may take custody of a status offender if
requested to do so by a parent or legal guardian in order to facilitate reunification (e.g., transported
home or to the station to await a parent). Juvenile status offenders shall not be held in secure
custody (34 USC § 11133).
(a) When a juvenile is a suspected runaway the officer shall:
1. Contact the parent, guardian or a responsible adult;
i. Allow the youth to speak with parent, guardian or responsible adult;
2. If it’s determined that the youth is not a runaway, the youth should be released
as soon as reasonably possible;
3. If it’s confirmed that the youth is a runaway, proceed with standard
documentation and reporting procedures;
4. Provide food, water, and access to lavatory facilities, as necessary; and,
5. If unable to contact a parent, guardian or responsible adult, or they do not
cooperate with police and/or refuse take custody of their runaway juvenile, follow

Temporary Custody of Juveniles
procedures described in the “Protective Custody” section of the Child Abuse
Policy.
312.4.3 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS
)Juvenile offenders should be held in non-secure custody while at the Berkeley Police Department
unless another form of custody is authorized by this policy or is necessary due to exigent
circumstances.
Generally, a juvenile offender may be taken into custody when authorized by a court order or when
there is probable cause to believe the juvenile has committed an offense that would subject an
adult to arrest (Welfare and Institutions Code § 625).
A juvenile offender who is 14 years of age or older and taken into custody for committing or
attempting to commit a felony with a firearm shall not be released and be transported to a juvenile
facility (Welfare and Institutions Code § 625.3).
In all other cases the juvenile offender may be:
(a) Transported to a juvenile facility.
(b) Released to a parent or other responsible adult after processing at the Department.
(c) Released upon warning or citation.
(d) Transported to his/her home or to the place where the juvenile offender was taken into
custody (Welfare and Institutions Code § 207.2).
In determining which disposition is appropriate, the investigating officer or supervisor shall prefer
the alternative which least restricts the juvenile’s freedom of movement, provided that alternative
is compatible with the best interests of the juvenile and the community (Welfare and Institutions
Code § 626).
Whenever a juvenile offender under the age of 14 is taken into custody, the officer should take
reasonable steps to verify and document the child's ability to differentiate between right and wrong,
particularly in relation to the alleged offense (Penal Code § 26).
312.5 ADVISEMENTS
Officers shall take immediate steps to notify the juvenile’s parent, guardian, or a responsible
relative that the juvenile is in custody, the location where the juvenile is being held, and the
intended disposition (Welfare and Institutions Code § 627).

Temporary Custody of Juveniles
Juveniles taken into custody for an offense shall immediately be advised (or at least within one
hour from being taken into custody, if possible) that they may make three telephone calls: one
call completed to his/her parent or guardian; one to a responsible relative or his/her employer;
and another call completed to an attorney. The calls shall be at no expense to the juvenile when
completed to telephone numbers within the local calling area. Juveniles should be asked whether
they are a caregiver and provided two more phone calls in the same manner as provided to adults
in the Temporary Custody of Adults Policy (Welfare and Institutions Code § 627; Penal Code §
851.5).
312.6 JUVENILE CUSTODY LOGS
Any time a juvenile is held in custody at the Department, the custody shall be promptly and properly

Code § 208; 15 CCR 1144). There should also be sight and sound separation between non-
offenders and juvenile and status offenders.
In situations where brief or accidental contact may occur (e.g., during the brief time a juvenile is
being fingerprinted and/or photographed in booking), a member of the Berkeley Police Department
(trained in the supervision of persons in custody) shall maintain a constant, immediate, side-by-
side presence with the juvenile or the adult to minimize any contact. If inadvertent or accidental
contact does occur, reasonable efforts shall be taken to end the contact (15 CCR 1144).
312.8 TEMPORARY CUSTODY REQUIREMENTS
Members assigned to monitor or process any juvenile at the Berkeley Police Department shall
ensure the following:
(a) A supervisor should be notified if it is anticipated that a juvenile may need to remain at
the Berkeley Police Department more than four hours. This will enable the supervisor
to ensure no juvenile is held at the Berkeley Police Department more than six hours.
(b) A staff member of the same sex shall supervise personal hygiene activities and care,
such as changing clothing or using the restroom, without direct observation to allow
for privacy.
(c) Juveniles shall have reasonable access to toilets and wash basins (15 CCR 1143).

taken as evidence or is otherwise unsuitable or inadequate for continued wear while
in custody (15 CCR 1143).
(i) Blankets shall be provided as reasonably necessary (15 CCR 1143).
1. The supervisor should ensure that there is an adequate supply of clean blankets.

the Temporary Custody of Adults Policy).
312.10 USE OF RESTRAINT DEVICES
Juvenile offenders may be handcuffed in accordance with the Handcuffing and Restraints Policy. A
juvenile offender may be handcuffed at the Berkeley Police Department when the juvenile presents
a heightened risk. However, non-offenders and status offenders should not be handcuffed unless
they are combative or threatening (15 CCR 1142).
Other restraints shall only be used after less restrictive measures have failed and with the approval
of a supervisor. Restraints shall only be used so long as it reasonably appears necessary for the
juvenile's protection or the protection of others (15 CCR 1142).
Juveniles in restraints shall be kept away from other unrestrained juveniles or monitored in such
a way as to protect the juvenile from abuse (15 CCR 1142).

312.12 SECURE CUSTODY
Only juvenile offenders 14 years of age or older may be placed in secure custody (Welfare and
Institutions Code § 207; 15 CCR 1145).
Secure custody should only be used for juvenile offenders when there is a reasonable belief that
the juvenile is a serious risk of harm to him/herself or others. Factors to be considered when
determining if the juvenile offender presents a serious security risk to him/herself or others include
the following (15 CCR 1145):
(a) Age, maturity and delinquent history
(b) Severity of offense for which the juvenile was taken into custody
(c) The juvenile offender’s behavior
(d) Availability of staff to provide adequate supervision or protection of the juvenile
offender

Members of this department shall document the reasons for placing the juvenile in secure custody
in the police report.
When practicable and when no locked enclosure is available, handcuffing one hand of a juvenile
offender to a fixed object while otherwise maintaining the juvenile in non-secure custody should
be considered as the method of secure custody. An employee must be present at all times to
ensure the juvenile’s safety while secured to a stationary object (15 CCR 1148).
Juveniles shall not be secured to a stationary object for more than 60 minutes. Supervisor approval
is required to secure a juvenile to a stationary object for longer than 60 minutes and every 30
minutes thereafter (15 CCR 1148). Supervisor approval should be documented.
The decision for securing a minor to a stationary object for longer than 60 minutes and every 30
minutes thereafter shall be based upon the best interests of the juvenile offender (15 CCR 1148).
312.12.1 LOCKED ENCLOSURES
A thorough inspection of the area shall be conducted before placing a juvenile into the enclosure.
A second inspection shall be conducted after removing the juvenile. Any damage noted to the
room should be photographed and documented in the crime report.
The following requirements shall apply to a juvenile offender who is held inside a locked enclosure:

may, within 30 calendar days, inspect and evaluate the jail, lockup, or court holding
facility pursuant to the provisions of 15 CCR 1046. Any inquiry made by the Board
shall be limited to the standards and requirements set forth in 15 CCR 1046.
(h) A medical and operational review of deaths and suicide attempts pursuant to 15 CCR
1046.
(i) Evidence preservation.
312.14 INTERVIEWING OR INTERROGATING JUVENILE SUSPECTS

Temporary Custody of Juveniles
Prior to conducting a custodial interrogation, including the waiver of Miranda rights, an officer shall
permit a juvenile 17 years of age or younger to consult with legal counsel in person, by telephone,

(a) Information is necessary to protect life or property from an imminent threat.
(b) The questions are limited to what is reasonably necessary to obtain the information
relating to the threat.
The Alameda County Public Defender's office staffs a 24-hour hotline (510-667-4433) that
will allow the in-custody juvenile to consult with an on-call attorney. At the conclusion of the
conversation with the Public Defender, officers shall contemporaneously provide the Miranda
Admonishment to the juvenile while the Public Defender is on the phone.In the event officers
cannot reach a Public Defender on the hotline, they should call the Juvenile Intake Phone number
at 510-667-7450.
312.14.1 MANDATORY RECORDINGS OF JUVENILES
Any interrogation of an individual under 18 years of age who is in custody and suspected
of committing murder shall be audio and video recorded when the interview takes place at a
department facility, jail, detention facility or other fixed place of detention. The recording shall
include the entire interview and a Miranda advisement preceding the interrogation (Penal Code
§ 859.5).
This recording is not mandatory when (Penal Code § 859.5):
(a) Recording is not feasible because of exigent circumstances that are later documented
in a report.
(b) The individual refuses to have the interrogation recorded, including a refusal any time
during the interrogation, and the refusal is documented in a report. If feasible, the
refusal shall be electronically recorded.
(c) The custodial interrogation occurred in another state by law enforcement officers
of that state, unless the interrogation was conducted with the intent to avoid the
requirements of Penal Code § 859.5.
(d) The interrogation occurs when no member conducting the interrogation has a
reason to believe that the individual may have committed murder. Continued
custodial interrogation concerning that offense shall be electronically recorded if the
interrogating member develops a reason to believe the individual committed murder.
(e) The interrogation would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or would
jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated or another
individual. Such circumstances shall be documented in a report.
(f) A recording device fails despite reasonable maintenance and the timely repair or
replacement is not feasible.
(g) The questions are part of a routine processing or booking, and are not an interrogation.

upon the approval from the Watch Commander or Detective Bureau supervisor, giving due
consideration to the following:
(a) The gravity of the offense
(b) The past record of the offender
(c) The age of the offender
312.16 RELEASE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING JUVENILES
Court decisions and legislation have combined to carefully specify situations in which information
may be given out or exchanged when a case involves a juvenile. Members of this department
shall not divulge any information regarding juveniles unless they are certain of the legal authority
to do so.
A copy of the current policy of the juvenile court concerning authorized release of information and
appropriate acknowledgment forms shall be kept with copies of this procedure in the Berkeley
Police Department Policy Manual. Such releases are authorized by Welfare and Institutions Code
§ 827 (click here to view: W&I 827).
Welfare and Institutions Code § 828 authorizes the release of certain information to other
agencies. It shall be the responsibility of the Support Services Bureau Lieutenant and the Detective
Bureau Lieutenant to ensure that personnel of those bureaus act within legal guidelines.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Senior and Disability Victimization
An unexplained or suspicious death of an elder, dependent adult, or other adult or child with a
disability should be treated as a potential homicide until a complete investigation including an
autopsy is completed, and it should not be assumed that the death of an elder or person with a
disability is natural simply because of the age or disability of the deceased (Penal Code § 368.6(c)
(18)).
313.4.1 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CONSIDERATIONS
The following factors as provided in Penal Code § 368.6 should be considered when investigating
incidents of elder and dependent adult abuse:
(a) Elder and dependent adult abuse, sex crimes, child abuse, domestic violence, and
any other criminal act, when committed in whole or in part because of the victim’s
actual or perceived disability, including disability caused by advanced age, is also a
hate crime (Penal Code § 368.6) (see the Hate Crimes Policy for additional guidance).
(b) Senior and disability victimization crimes are also domestic violence subject to the
mandatory arrest requirements of Penal Code § 836 if they meet the elements
described in Penal Code § 273.5, including but not limited to a violation by a caretaker
or other person who is or was a cohabitant of the victim, regardless of whether the
cohabitant is or was a relative of, or in an intimate personal relationship with, the victim
(Penal Code § 368.6(c)(10)).
(c) Many victims of sexual assault and other sex crimes delay disclosing the crimes for
reasons including but not limited to shame, embarrassment, self-doubt, fear of being
disbelieved, and fear of retaliation by the perpetrator or others (Penal Code § 368.6(c)
(11)).
(d) Victims and witnesses with disabilities, including cognitive and communication

313.6 PROTECTIVE CUSTODY
Before taking an elder or dependent adult abuse victim into protective custody when facts indicate
the adult may not be able to care for him/herself, the officer should make reasonable attempts to
contact APS. Generally, removal of an adult abuse victim from his/her family, guardian, or other
responsible adult should be left to the welfare authorities when they are present or have become
involved in an investigation.
Generally, members of this department should remove an elder or dependent adult abuse victim
from his/her family or guardian without a court order only when no other effective alternative is
reasonably available and immediate action reasonably appears necessary to protect the victim.
Prior to taking an elder or dependent adult abuse victim into protective custody, the officer should
take reasonable steps to deliver the adult to another qualified legal guardian, unless it reasonably
appears that the release would endanger the victim or result in abduction. If this is not a reasonable
option, the officer shall ensure that the adult is delivered to APS.
Whenever practicable, the officer should inform a supervisor of the circumstances prior to taking an
elder or dependent adult abuse victim into protective custody. If prior notification is not practicable,
officers should contact a supervisor promptly after taking the adult into protective custody.
When elder or dependent adult abuse victims are under state control, have a state-appointed
guardian, or there are other legal holdings for guardianship, it may be necessary or reasonable
to seek a court order on behalf of the adult victim to either remove the adult from a dangerous
environment (protective custody) or restrain a person from contact with the adult.
313.6.1 EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDERS
In any situation which an officer reasonably believes that an elder or dependent adult is in
immediate and present danger of abuse based on an allegation of a recent incident of abuse or
threat of abuse (other than financial abuse alone), the officer may seek an emergency protective
order against the person alleged to have committed or threatened such abuse (Family Code §
6250(d)).
313.6.2 VERIFICATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER
Whenever an officer verifies that a relevant protective order has been issued, the officer shall make
reasonable efforts to determine if the order prohibits the person from possession of firearms or
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Senior and Disability Victimization - 134

Law Enforcement Manual
Senior and Disability Victimization
requires the relinquishment of firearms, and if the order does so, the officer shall make reasonable
efforts to (Penal Code § 368.6(c)(19)):
(a) Inquire whether the restrained person possesses firearms. The officer should make
this effort by asking the restrained person and the protected person.
(b) Query the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System to determine if
any firearms are registered to the restrained person.
(c) Receive or seize prohibited firearms located in plain view or pursuant to a consensual
or other lawful search in compliance with Penal Code § 18250 et seq. and in
accordance with department procedures.
313.7 INTERVIEWS
313.7.1 PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS
Absent extenuating circumstances or impracticality, officers should audio record the preliminary
interview with a suspected elder or dependent adult abuse victim. Officers should avoid multiple
interviews with the victim and should attempt to gather only the information necessary to begin an
investigation. When practicable, investigating officers should defer interviews until a person who
is specially trained in such interviews is available.
313.7.2 DETAINING VICTIMS FOR INTERVIEWS
An officer should not detain an adult involuntarily who is suspected of being a victim of abuse
solely for the purpose of an interview or physical exam without his/her consent or the consent of
a guardian unless one of the following applies:
(a) Exigent circumstances exist, such as:
1. A reasonable belief that medical issues of the adult need to be addressed
immediately.
2. A reasonable belief that the adult is or will be in danger of harm if the interview
or physical exam is not immediately completed.
3. The alleged offender is a family member or guardian and there is reason to
believe the adult may be in continued danger.
(b) A court order or warrant has been issued.
313.7.3 INTERVIEWS WITH A PERSON WITH DEAFNESS OR HEARING LOSS
An officer who is interviewing a victim or witness who reports or demonstrates deafness or hearing
loss should secure the services of a qualified interpreter (as defined by Evidence Code § 754)
prior to the start of the interview (Penal Code § 368.6) (see the Communications with Persons
with Disabilities Policy for additional guidance).
313.8 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
When an elder or dependent adult abuse investigation requires a medical examination, the
investigating officer should obtain consent for such examination from the victim, guardian, agency,

or entity having legal custody of the adult. The officer should also arrange for the adult’s
transportation to the appropriate medical facility.
In cases where the alleged offender is a family member, guardian, agency, or entity having legal
custody and is refusing to give consent for the medical examination, officers should notify a
supervisor before proceeding. If exigent circumstances do not exist or if state law does not provide
for officers to take the adult for a medical examination, the supervisor should consider other
government agencies or services that may obtain a court order for such an examination.
313.9 DRUG-ENDANGERED VICTIMS

the immediate and longer-term medical and safety needs of an elder or dependent adult abuse
victim who has been exposed to the manufacturing, trafficking, or use of narcotics.

Officers responding to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where an elder or dependent
adult abuse victim is present or where there is evidence that an elder or dependent adult abuse

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent supervisors or managers from discharging
supervisory or management responsibilities, such as determining duty assignments, evaluating
or counseling members or issuing discipline, in a manner that is consistent with established
procedures.
314.4.3 QUESTIONS OR CLARIFICATION
Members with questions regarding what constitutes discrimination, sexual harassment or
retaliation are encouraged to contact a supervisor, a manager, the Chief of Police, the Professional

Discriminatory Harassment
Standards Division Captain, the City Manager, the City's Equal Employment Opportunity and
Diversity (EEO) Officer, or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH)
for further information, direction or clarification (Government Code § 12950).
314.5 INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS
Various methods of resolution exist. During the pendency of any such investigation, the supervisor
of the involved member should take prompt and reasonable steps to mitigate or eliminate
any continuing abusive or hostile work environment. It is the policy of the Department that all
complaints of discrimination, retaliation or harassment shall be fully documented and promptly
and thoroughly investigated.
314.5.1 SUPERVISOR RESOLUTION
Members who believe they are experiencing discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should be
encouraged to inform the individual that the behavior is unwelcome, offensive, unprofessional,
or inappropriate. However, if the member feels uncomfortable or threatened or has difficulty
expressing the member's concern, or if this does not resolve the concern, assistance should be
sought from a supervisor or manager who is a rank higher than the alleged transgressor.
314.5.2 FORMAL INVESTIGATION
If the complaint cannot be satisfactorily resolved through the process described above, a formal
investigation will be conducted.
The person assigned to investigate the complaint will have full authority to investigate all aspects
of the complaint. Investigative authority includes access to records and the cooperation of any
members involved. No influence will be used to suppress any complaint and no member will be
subject to retaliation or reprisal for filing a complaint, encouraging others to file a complaint or for
offering testimony or evidence in any investigation.
Formal investigation of the complaint will be confidential to the extent possible and will include, but
is not limited to, details of the specific incident, frequency and dates of occurrences and names
of any witnesses. Witnesses will be advised regarding the prohibition against retaliation, and that
a disciplinary process, up to and including termination, may result if retaliation occurs.
Members who believe they have been discriminated against, harassed or retaliated against
because of their protected status, are encouraged to follow the chain of command but may also
file a complaint directly with the City's Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity (EEO) Officer,
Chief of Police, Professional Standards Division Captain or the City Manager.
314.5.3 ALTERNATIVE COMPLAINT PROCESS
No provision of this policy shall be construed to prevent any member from seeking legal redress
outside the Department. Members who believe that they have been harassed, discriminated
against, or retaliated against are entitled to bring complaints of employment discrimination to
federal, state, and/or local agencies responsible for investigating such allegations. Specific
time limitations apply to the filing of such charges. Members are advised that proceeding with
complaints under the provisions of this policy does not in any way affect those filing requirements.

Child Abuse
315.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for the investigation of suspected child abuse.
This policy also addresses when Berkeley Police Department members are required to notify the
county Child Protective Services (CPS) of suspected child abuse.
315.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Child - Unless otherwise specified by a cited statute, a child is any person under the age of 18
years.
Child abuse - Any offense or attempted offense involving violence or neglect with a child victim
when committed by a person responsible for the child’s care or any other act that would mandate
notification to a social service agency or law enforcement (Penal Code § 11165.9; Penal Code
§ 11166).
315.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department will investigate all reported incidents of alleged criminal child
abuse and ensure CPS is notified as required by law.
315.3 MANDATORY NOTIFICATION
The child protection agency shall be notified when (Penal Code § 11166):
(a) There is a known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect reported, which is
alleged to have occurred as a result of the action of a person responsible for the child's
welfare, or
(b) A person responsible for the child's welfare fails to adequately protect the child from
abuse when the person knew or reasonably should have known that the child was in
danger of abuse.
The District Attorney’s office shall be notified in all instances of known or suspected child abuse or
neglect reported to this department. Notification of the District Attorney is not required for reports
only involving neglect by a person, who has the care or custody of a child, to provide adequate
food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision where no physical injury to the child has
occurred (Penal Code § 11166).
When the abuse or neglect occurs at a licensed facility or is alleged to have resulted from the
actions of a person who is required to have a state license (e.g., foster homes, group homes,
day care), notification shall also be made to the California Department of Social Services or other
applicable licensing authority. When the alleged abuse or neglect involves a child of a minor parent
or a dependent adult, notification shall also be made to the attorney of the minor or the dependent
adult within 36 hours (Penal Code 11166.1; Penal Code 11166.2).

Law Enforcement Manual
Child Abuse
For purposes of notification, the abuse or neglect includes physical injury or death inflicted by other
than accidental means upon a child by another person; sexual abuse (Penal Code § 11165.1);
neglect (Penal Code § 11165.2); the willful harming or injuring of a child or the endangering of the
person or health of a child (Penal Code § 11165.3); and unlawful corporal punishment or injury
(Penal Code § 11165.4). Child abuse or neglect does not include a mutual affray between minors,
nor does it include an injury caused by the reasonable and necessary force used by a peace
officer acting within the course and scope of the peace officer's employment as a peace officer.
315.3.1 NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE
Notification should occur as follows (Penal Code § 11166):
(a) Notification shall be made immediately, or as soon as practicable, by telephone, fax
or electronic transmission.
(b) A written follow-up report should be forwarded within 36 hours of receiving the
information concerning the incident.
315.4 QUALIFIED INVESTIGATORS
Qualified investigators should be available for child abuse investigations. These investigators
should:
(a) Conduct interviews in child appropriate interview facilities.
(b) Be familiar with forensic interview techniques specific to child abuse investigations.
(c) Present all cases of alleged child abuse to the prosecutor for review.
(d) Coordinate with other enforcement agencies, social service agencies and school
administrators as needed.
(e) Provide referrals to therapy services, victim advocates, guardians and support for the
child and family as appropriate.
(f) Participate in or coordinate with multidisciplinary investigative teams as applicable
(Welfare and Institutions Code § 18961.7).
315.5 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTING
In all reported or suspected cases of child abuse, a report will be written. Officers shall write a
report even if the allegations appear unfounded or unsubstantiated.
Investigations and reports related to suspected cases of child abuse should address, as
applicable:
(a) The overall basis for the contact. This should be done by the investigating officer in all
circumstances where a suspected child abuse victim was contacted.
(b) The exigent circumstances that existed if officers interviewed the child victim without
the presence of a parent or guardian.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Child Abuse - 150

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Child Abuse
(c) Any relevant statements the child may have made and to whom he/she made the
statements.
(d) If a child was taken into protective custody, the reasons, the name and title of the
person making the decision, and why other alternatives were not appropriate.
(e) Documentation of any visible injuries or any injuries identified by the child. This should
include photographs of such injuries, if practicable.
(f) Whether the child victim was transported for medical treatment or a medical
examination.
(g) Whether the victim identified a household member as the alleged perpetrator, and a
list of the names of any other children who may reside in the residence.
(h) Identification of any prior related reports or allegations of child abuse, including other
jurisdictions, as reasonably known.
(i) Previous addresses of the victim and suspect.
(j) Other potential witnesses who have not yet been interviewed, such as relatives or
others close to the victim’s environment.
All cases of the unexplained death of a child should be investigated as thoroughly as if it had been
a case of suspected child abuse (e.g., a sudden or unexplained death of an infant).
315.5.1 EXTRA JURISDICTIONAL REPORTS
If a report of known or suspected child abuse or neglect that is alleged to have occurred outside this
jurisdiction is received, department members shall ensure that the caller is immediately transferred
to the agency with proper jurisdiction for the investigation of the case. If the caller cannot be
successfully transferred to the appropriate agency, a report shall be taken and immediately
referred by telephone, fax or electronic transfer to the agency with proper jurisdiction (Penal Code
11165.9).
315.6 PROTECTIVE CUSTODY
Before taking any child into protective custody, the officer should make reasonable attempts to
contact CPS. Generally, removal of a child from his/her family, guardian or other responsible adult
should be left to the child welfare authorities when they are present or have become involved in
an investigation.
Generally, members of this department should remove a child from his/her parent or guardian
without a court order only when no other effective alternative is reasonably available and
immediate action reasonably appears necessary to protect the child. Prior to taking a child into
protective custody, the officer should take reasonable steps to deliver the child to another qualified
parent or legal guardian, unless it reasonably appears that the release would endanger the child
or result in abduction. If this is not a reasonable option, the officer shall ensure that the child is
delivered to CPS.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Child Abuse - 151

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Child Abuse
Whenever practicable, the officer should inform a supervisor of the circumstances prior to taking
a child into protective custody. If prior notification is not practicable, officers should contact a
supervisor promptly after taking a child into protective custody.
Children may only be removed from a parent or guardian in the following situations when a court
order cannot reasonably be obtained in a timely manner (Welfare and Institutions Code § 305):
(a) The officer reasonably believes the child is a person described in Welfare and
Institutions Code § 300, or a commercially exploited child under Penal Code § 647 and
Penal Code § 653.22, and further has good cause to believe that any of the following
conditions exist:
1. The child has an immediate need for medical care.
2. The child is in immediate danger of physical or sexual abuse.
3. The physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses
an immediate threat to the child’s health or safety. In the case of a child left
unattended, the officer shall first attempt to locate and determine if a responsible
parent or guardian is available and capable of assuming custody before taking
the child into protective custody.
(b) The officer reasonably believes the child requires protective custody under the
provisions of Penal Code § 279.6, in one of the following circumstances:
1. It reasonably appears to the officer that a person is likely to conceal the child,
flee the jurisdiction with the child or, by flight or concealment, evade the authority
of the court.
2. There is no lawful custodian available to take custody of the child.
3. There are conflicting custody orders or conflicting claims to custody and the
parties cannot agree which party should take custody of the child.
4. The child is an abducted child.
(c) The child is in the company of, or under the control of, a person arrested for Penal
Code § 278 (Detainment or concealment of child from legal custodian) or Penal Code
§ 278.5 (Deprivation of custody of a child or right to visitation) (Penal Code § 279.6).
A child taken into protective custody shall be delivered to CPS unless otherwise directed by court
order.
315.6.1 CALIFORNIA SAFELY SURRENDERED BABY LAW
An individual having lawful custody of an infant less than 72 hours old is not guilty of abandonment
if the individual voluntarily surrenders physical custody of the infant to personnel on-duty at a safe-
surrender site, such as a hospital or fire department (Penal Code § 271.5). The law requires the
surrender site to notify CPS.

315.6.2 NEWBORNS TESTING POSITIVE FOR DRUGS
Under certain circumstances, officers can be prohibited from taking a newborn who is the subject
of a proposed adoption into protective custody, even when the newborn has tested positive for
illegal drugs or the birth mother tested positive for illegal drugs.
Officers shall instead follow the provisions of Welfare and Institutions Code § 305.6 to ensure that
the newborn is placed with the adoptive parents when it is appropriate.
315.6.3 CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES - WARRANT SERVICE
There are times when CPS has investigated the parent(s)’s capability to care for the child prior
to police involvement and have obtained a court order granting temporary custody of the child
to CPS. In such a case the officer shall “serve” the warrant by handing the court order to the
parent(s). The officer shall not sign the order or complete any Return of Service form for CPS.
315.7 INTERVIEWS
315.7.1 PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS
Absent extenuating circumstances or impracticality, officers should record the preliminary
interview with suspected child abuse victims. Officers should avoid multiple interviews with a child
victim and should attempt to gather only the information necessary to begin an investigation. When
practicable, investigating officers should defer interviews until a person who is specially trained
in such interviews is available. Generally, child victims should not be interviewed in the home or
location where the alleged abuse occurred.
315.7.2 DETAINING SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE VICTIMS FOR AN INTERVIEW
An officer should not detain a child involuntarily who is suspected of being a victim of child abuse
solely for the purpose of an interview or physical exam without the consent of a parent or guardian
unless one of the following applies:
(a) Exigent circumstances exist, such as:
1. A reasonable belief that medical issues of the child need to be addressed
immediately.
2. A reasonable belief that the child is or will be in danger of harm if the interview
or physical exam is not immediately completed.
3. The alleged offender is the custodial parent or guardian and there is reason to
believe the child may be in continued danger.
(b) A court order or warrant has been issued.
315.7.3 INTERVIEWS AT A SCHOOL
Any student at school who is a suspected victim of child abuse shall be afforded the option of
being interviewed in private or selecting any qualified available adult member of the school staff
to be present. The purpose of the staff member’s presence is to provide comfort and support. The
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Child Abuse - 153
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Child Abuse
staff member shall not participate in the interview. The selection of a staff member should be such
that it does not burden the school with costs or hardship (Penal Code § 11174.3).
315.8 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
If the child has been the victim of abuse that requires a medical examination, the investigating
officer should obtain consent for such examination from the appropriate parent, guardian or agency
having legal custody of the child. The officer should also arrange for the child’s transportation to
the appropriate medical facility.
In cases where the alleged offender is the custodial parent or guardian and is refusing consent
for the medical examination, officers should notify a supervisor before proceeding. If exigent
circumstances do not exist or if state law does not provide for officers to take the child for a
medical examination, the notified supervisor should consider obtaining a court order for such an
examination.
315.9 DRUG-ENDANGERED CHILDREN
A coordinated response by law enforcement and social services agencies is appropriate to
meet the immediate and longer-term medical and safety needs of children exposed to the
manufacturing, trafficking or use of narcotics.
315.9.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
The Special Victims Unit Sergeant should:
(a) Work with professionals from the appropriate agencies, including CPS, other law
enforcement agencies, medical service providers and local prosecutors to develop
community specific procedures for responding to situations where there are children
endangered by exposure to methamphetamine labs or the manufacture and trafficking
of other drugs.
(b) Activate any available interagency response when an officer notifies the Detective
Bureau supervisor that the officer has responded to a drug lab or other narcotics crime
scene where a child is present or where evidence indicates that a child lives there.
315.9.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
Officers responding to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where a child is present or where
there is evidence that a child lives should:
(a) Document the environmental, medical, social and other conditions of the child with a
Case Report and utilize photography for evidentiary purposes.
(b) Notify the Detective Bureau so an interagency response can begin.
315.10 STATE MANDATES AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS

(Penal Code 841.5; Penal Code § 11167.5).
315.10.2 REQUESTS FOR REMOVAL FROM THE CHILD ABUSECENTRAL INDEX (CACI)
Any person whose name has been forwarded to the California Department of Justice (DOJ) for
placement in California’s CACI, as a result of an investigation, may request that his/her name
be removed from the CACI list. Requests shall not qualify for consideration if there is an active
case, ongoing investigation or pending prosecution that precipitated the entry to CACI (Penal
Code § 11169). All requests for removal shall be submitted in writing by the requesting person
and promptly routed to the CACI hearing officer.
315.10.3 CACI HEARING OFFICER
The Detective Bureau supervisor will normally serve as the hearing officer but must not be actively
connected with the case that resulted in the person’s name being submitted to CACI. Upon
receiving a qualified request for removal, the hearing officer shall promptly schedule a hearing to
take place during normal business hours and provide written notification of the time and place of
the hearing to the requesting party.
315.10.4 CACI HEARING PROCEDURES
The hearing is an informal process where the person requesting removal from the CACI list will
be permitted to present relevant evidence (e.g., certified copy of an acquittal, factual finding of
innocence) as to why his/her name should be removed. The person requesting the hearing may
record the hearing at his/her own expense.
Formal rules of evidence will not apply and the hearing officer may consider, in addition to evidence
submitted by the person requesting the hearing, any relevant information including, but not limited
to, the following:
(a) Case reports including any supplemental reports
(b) Statements by investigators
(c) Statements from representatives of the District Attorney’s Office
(d) Statements by representatives of a child protective agency who may be familiar with
the case
After considering all information presented, the hearing officer shall make a determination as to
whether the requesting party’s name should be removed from the CACI list. Such determination
shall be based on a finding that the allegations in the investigation are not substantiated (Penal
Code § 11169).
If, after considering the evidence, the hearing officer finds that the allegations are not
substantiated, he/she shall cause a request to be completed and forwarded to the DOJ that the

person’s name be removed from the CACI list. A copy of the hearing results and the request for
removal will be attached to the case reports.
The findings of the hearing officer shall be considered final and binding.
315.10.5 CHILD DEATH REVIEW TEAM
This department should cooperate with any interagency child death review team investigation.
Written and oral information relating to the death of a child that would otherwise be subject to
release restrictions may be disclosed to the child death review team upon written request and
approval of a supervisor (Penal Code § 11174.32).

Missing Persons
316.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidance for handling missing person investigations.
316.1.1 DEFINITIONS
At risk - Includes, but is not limited to (Penal Code § 14215):
• A victim of a crime or foul play.
• A person missing and in need of medical attention.
• A missing person who is age 11 or younger.
• A missing person with no pattern of running away or disappearing.
• A missing person who may be the victim of parental abduction.
• A mentally impaired missing person, including cognitively impaired or developmentally
disabled.
Missing person - Any person who is reported missing to law enforcement when the person’s
location is unknown. This includes a child who has been taken, detained, concealed, enticed away
or kept by a parent in violation of the law (Penal Code § 277 et seq.). It also includes any child who
is missing voluntarily, involuntarily or under circumstances that do not conform to his/her ordinary
habits or behavior, and who may be in need of assistance (Penal Code § 14215).
Missing person networks - Databases or computer networks available to law enforcement and
that are suitable for information related to missing persons investigations. These include the
National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System (CLETS), and the Missing and Unidentified Persons System (MUPS).
316.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department does not consider any report of a missing person to be routine
and assumes that the missing person is in need of immediate assistance until an investigation
reveals otherwise. The Berkeley Police Department gives missing person cases priority over
property-related cases and will not require any time frame to pass before beginning a missing
person investigation (Penal Code § 14211).
316.3 REQUIRED FORMS AND BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION KITS
The Detective Bureau Lieutenant, or his/her designee, should develop and make available forms
and kits in accordance with this policy, state law, federal law and the California Peace Officer
Standards and Training (POST) Missing Persons Investigations guidelines, including:
• Department report form for use in missing person cases
• Missing person investigation checklist that provides investigation guidelines and
resources that could be helpful in the early hours of a missing person investigation
(Penal Code § 13519.07)

• California DOJ missing person forms as appropriate
• Biological sample collection kits
316.4 ACCEPTANCE OF REPORTS
Any member encountering a person who wishes to report a missing person or runaway shall
render assistance without delay (Penal Code § 14211). This can be accomplished by accepting
the report via telephone or in-person and initiating the investigation. Those members who are
unable to render immediate assistance shall promptly dispatch or alert a member who can take
the report.
A report shall be accepted in all cases and regardless of where the person was last seen, where
the person resides or any other question of jurisdiction (Penal Code § 14211).
316.5 INITIAL INVESTIGATION
Officers or other members conducting the initial investigation of a missing person shall take the
following investigative actions, as applicable:
(a) Respond to a dispatched call for service as soon as practicable.
(b) Interview the reporting party and any witnesses to determine whether the person
qualifies as a missing person and, if so, whether the person may be at risk.
(c) Notify a supervisor immediately if there is evidence that a missing person is either at
risk or may qualify for a public alert, or both (see the Public Alerts Policy).
(d) Broadcast a "Be on the Look-Out" (BOLO) bulletin if the person is under 21 years
of age or there is evidence that the missing person is at risk. The BOLO should be
broadcast as soon as practicable but in no event more than one hour after determining
the missing person is under 21 years of age or may be at risk (Penal Code § 14211).
(e) Make entries into the appropriate missing person networks as follows:
1. Within two hours of the initial report, when the missing person is under 21 years
old or is considered at risk.
2. In all other cases, as soon as practicable, but not later than four hours from the
time of the officer's initial contact with the reporting party.
(f) Complete the appropriate report forms accurately and completely and initiate a search
as applicable under the facts.
(g) Collect and/or review:
1. A photograph of the missing person, if available.
2. Any documents that may assist in the investigation, such as court orders
regarding custody.
3. Any other evidence that may assist in the investigation, including personal
electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, computers).

Missing Persons
(h) When circumstances permit and if appropriate, attempt to determine the missing
person’s location through his/her telecommunications carrier.
(i) Contact the appropriate agency if the report relates to a previously made missing
person report and another agency is actively investigating that report. When this
is not practical, the information should be documented in an appropriate report for
transmission to the appropriate agency. If the information relates to an at-risk missing
person, the member should notify a supervisor and proceed with reasonable steps to
locate the missing person.
316.6 REPORT PROCEDURES AND ROUTING
Employees should complete all missing person reports and forms promptly and submit them for
supervisor approval.
316.6.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of the supervisor shall include, but are not limited to:
(a) Reviewing and approving missing person reports upon receipt.

319.4 HATE CRIME VS. HATE INCIDENT
Many acts of hate violence fall under the category of a hate crime, which is punishable by law.
However, not all hate incidents are hate crimes. For example, verbal name calling, although
offensive, is not a crime and must be accompanied by a viable threat of violence and the ability
to carry out the threat.
For a hate incident to be categorized as a hate crime, it must violate a criminal law. A hate crime
might include threatening phone calls, physical assaults, destruction of property, bomb threats,
and/or the disturbance of religious meetings.
A hate incident that does not constitute a hate crime might include hate speech, display of offensive
materials on one's property, the distribution of hate materials in public places, and the posting of
hate materials that does not result in property damage. Even if a hate incident does not rise to the
level of a hate crime, the victim will still need support and assistance and may have an actionable
civil claim as well.
319.5 CRIMINAL STATUTES
The key criminal statutes on hate crimes are
(a) Penal Code § 422.6 which provides that it is a misdemeanor to both (a) threaten or
injure an individual or (b) damage property because of the real or perceived beliefs or
characteristics of the other person; and
(b) Penal Code § 422.7 which provides that it is a felony to both (a) threaten or injure an
individual (when the injury could or does result in great bodily injury) or (b) damage

property (when the damage is in excess of $950) because of the real or perceived
beliefs or characteristics of the other person.
319.6 INVESTIGATIONS
Whenever any member of this department receives a report of a suspected hate crime or other
activity that reasonably appears to involve a potential hate crime, the following should occur:
(a) Assigned officers should promptly contact the victim, witness or reporting party to
investigate the matter further as circumstances may dictate
(b) A supervisor should be notified of the circumstances as soon as practical.
(c) Once in-progress aspects of any such situation have been stabilized (e.g., treatment
of victims, apprehension of suspects at the scene), the assigned officers should take
all reasonable steps to preserve evidence that establishes a possible hate crime.
(d) Based upon available information, officers should take appropriate action to mitigate
further injury or damage to potential victims or the community.
1. Officers should contact the property owner to remove any evidence that cannot
be physically removed (i.e., painted words or signs on a wall) by the officer once
the offense is documented.
(e) The assigned officers should interview available witnesses, victims and others to
determine what circumstances, if any, indicate that the situation may involve a hate
crime.
1. No victim of or a witness to a hate crime who is not otherwise charged with
or convicted of a crime under state law may be detained for or turned over to
federal authorities exclusively for any actual or suspected immigration violation
(Penal Code § 422.93(b))
2. Statements of victims and witnesses should be audio or video recorded if
practicable (see the Portable Audio/Video Recorders Policy).
(f) Depending on the situation, the assigned officers or supervisor may request additional
assistance from detectives or other resources.
(g) The assigned officers should include all available evidence indicating the likelihood of
a hate crime in the relevant reports. All related reports should be clearly marked as
“Hate Crimes” and, absent prior approval of a supervisor, should be completed and
submitted by the assigned officers before the end of the shift.
(h) The assigned officers will provide the victims of any suspected hate crime with a
brochure on hate crimes (Penal Code § 422.92). Such brochures will also be available
to members of the general public upon request. The assigned officers should also
make reasonable efforts to assist the victims by providing available information on
local assistance programs and organizations.
(i) The assigned officers and supervisor should take reasonable steps to ensure that any
such situation does not escalate further and should provide information to the victim
regarding legal aid (e.g., Possible Temporary Restraining Order through the District
Attorney or City Attorney Penal Code § 136.2 or Civil Code § 52.1 as indicated).

Standards of Conduct
321.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes standards of conduct that are consistent with the values and mission of
the Berkeley Police Department and are expected of all department members. The standards
contained in this policy are not intended to be an exhaustive list of requirements and prohibitions
but they do identify many of the important matters concerning conduct. In addition to the provisions
of this policy, members are subject to all other provisions contained in this manual, as well as
any additional guidance on conduct that may be disseminated by this department or a member’s
supervisors.
321.2 POLICY
The continued employment or appointment of every member of the Berkeley Police Department
shall be based on conduct that reasonably conforms to the guidelines set forth herein. Failure to
meet the guidelines set forth in this policy, whether on- or off-duty, may be cause for disciplinary
action.
321.3 DIRECTIVES AND ORDERS
Members shall comply with lawful directives and orders from any department supervisor or person
in a position of authority, absent a reasonable and bona fide justification.
321.3.1 UNLAWFUL OR CONFLICTING ORDERS
Supervisors shall not knowingly issue orders or directives that, if carried out, would result in a
violation of any law or department policy. Supervisors should not issue orders that conflict with
any previous order without making reasonable clarification that the new order is intended to
countermand the earlier order.
No member is required to obey any order that appears to be in direct conflict with any federal
law, state law or local ordinance. Following a known unlawful order is not a defense and does not
relieve the member from criminal or civil prosecution or administrative discipline. If the legality of
an order is in doubt, the affected member shall ask the issuing supervisor to clarify the order or
shall confer with a higher authority. The responsibility for refusal to obey rests with the member,
who shall subsequently be required to justify the refusal.
Unless it would jeopardize the safety of any individual, members who are presented with a lawful
order that is in conflict with a previous lawful order, department policy or other directive shall
respectfully inform the issuing supervisor of the conflict. The issuing supervisor is responsible
for either resolving the conflict or clarifying that the lawful order is intended to countermand the
previous lawful order or directive, in which case the member is obliged to comply. Members who
are compelled to follow a conflicting lawful order after having given the issuing supervisor the
opportunity to correct the conflict, will not be held accountable for disobedience of the lawful order
or directive that was initially issued.

shall be quiet, orderly, attentive and respectful and shall exercise patience and discretion in the
performance of their duties.
Discipline may be initiated for any good cause. It is not mandatory that a specific policy or rule
violation be cited to sustain discipline. This policy is not intended to cover every possible type of
misconduct.

resources, including computers, software and systems, that are issued or maintained by the
Department in a professional manner and in accordance with this policy.

department email system, computer network, and/or any information placed into storage on any
department system or device. This includes records of all keystrokes or Web-browsing history

It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to identify and monitor registered offenders living
within this jurisdiction and to take reasonable steps to address the risks those persons may pose.

investigations should conduct the registration in order to best evaluate any threat the person may
pose to the community. Those assigned to register offenders should receive appropriate training
regarding the registration process.
Upon conclusion of the registration process, the investigator shall ensure that the registration
information is provided to the California Department of Justice (DOJ) in accordance with applicable
law (Penal Code § 457.1; Penal Code § 290 et seq.).

required by the California DOJ, fingerprints and a photograph, and any other information required
by applicable law (Penal Code § 457.1; Penal Code § 290 et seq.).

residence, or knock-and-talk contact.
(b) Review of information on the California DOJ website for sex offenders.
(c) Contact with a registrant’s parole or probation officer.
Any discrepancies should be reported to the California DOJ as appropriate, and may result in
criminal prosecution.

registrant’s presence in the community. Members who identify a significant risk or other public
safety issue associated with a registrant should promptly advise their supervisor. The supervisor

(q) All deaths of state hospital patients.
(r) Suspected Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths or Sudden Unexplained
Infant Death.
(s) All deaths where the patient is comatose throughout the period of the physician’s
attendance. Includes patients admitted to hospitals unresponsive and expire without
regaining consciousness.
The body shall not be disturbed or moved from the position or place of death without permission
of the coroner.
330.4.2 SEARCHING DEAD BODIES
The Coroner or Deputy Coroner is generally the only person permitted to search a body known to
be dead from any of the circumstances set forth in Government Code § 27491. The only exception
is that an officer is permitted to search the body of a person killed in a traffic collision for the limited
purpose of locating an anatomical donor card (Government Code § 27491.3). If such a donor card
is located, the Coroner or a designee shall be promptly notified. Should exigent circumstances
indicate to an officer that any search of a known dead body is warranted prior to the arrival of the
Coroner or a designee; the investigating officer shall first obtain verbal consent from the Coroner
or a designee (Government Code § 27491.2).
Whenever possible, a witness, preferably a relative to the deceased or a member of the household,
should be requested to remain at the scene with the officer pending the arrival of the Coroner or
a designee. The name and address of this person shall be included in the narrative of the death

Death Investigation
report. Whenever personal effects are removed from the body of the deceased by the Coroner or
a designee, a receipt shall be obtained. This receipt shall be attached to the death report.
330.4.3 DEATH NOTIFICATION
The Coroner is responsible for notifying relatives or friends of the deceased, but department
members shall assist as requested. When practical, and if not handled by the Coroner’s Office,
notification to the next-of-kin of the deceased person should be made, in person, by the supervisor
assigned to the incident.
If the next-of-kin lives in another jurisdiction, a law enforcement official from that jurisdiction shall
be requested to make the personal notification. If the relatives live outside this county, the Coroner
may be requested to make the notification. The Coroner and any assigned detectives shall be
advised if the next-of-kin notification has been made. Any notifications made, or requests for
notifications, shall be documented in the associated report.
330.4.4 UNIDENTIFIED DEAD BODIES
If the identity of a dead body cannot be established after the Coroner arrives, the Coroner’s office
will issue a “John Doe" or "Jane Doe” number for the report.
330.4.5 DEATH INVESTIGATION REPORTING
All incidents involving a death shall be documented on the appropriate form.
330.4.6 SUSPECTED HOMICIDE
If the initially assigned officer suspects that the death involves a homicide or other suspicious
circumstances, the Homicide Sergeant or designee shall be notified to determine the possible
need for detectives to respond to the scene for further immediate investigation.
Pending arrival of the Homicide Detail, the assigned officer shall investigate the circumstances
surrounding the death, including but not limited to obtaining statements, securing the scene,
gathering evidence and making arrests.
330.4.7 EMPLOYMENT RELATED DEATHS OR INJURIES
Any member of this agency who responds to and determines that a death, serious illness,
or serious injury has occurred as a result of an accident at or in connection with the victim's
employment shall ensure that the nearest office of Cal-OSHA is notified by telephone immediately
or as soon as practicable with all pertinent information (8 CCR 342(b)).

Identity Theft
331.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Identity theft is a growing trend that frequently involves related crimes in multiple jurisdictions. This
policy is intended to provide guidelines for the reporting and investigation of such crimes.
331.2 REPORTING
In an effort to maintain uniformity in reporting, officers presented with the crime of identity
theft (Penal Code § 530.6) shall initiate a report for victims residing within the jurisdiction of
this department when the crime occurred. For incidents of identity theft occurring outside this
jurisdiction, officers should observe the following:
(a) For any victim not residing within this jurisdiction, the officer may either take a courtesy
report to be forwarded to the victim’s residence agency or the victim should be
encouraged to promptly report the identity theft to the law enforcement agency where
he or she resides.
331.3 RELATED CRIMES
While the crime of identity theft should be reported to the law enforcement agency where the
victim resides, officers of this department should investigate and report crimes occurring within
this jurisdiction which have resulted from the original identity theft (e.g., the identity theft occurred
elsewhere, but the credit card fraud occurred and is reported in this jurisdiction).
Officers should include all known incidents of fraudulent activity (e.g., credit card number applied
for in victim’s name when the victim has never made such an application).
331.4 ADDITIONAL REPORTS
Officers should also cross-reference all known reports made by the victim (e.g., U.S. Secret
Service, credit reporting bureaus, U.S. Postal Service and DMV) with all known report numbers.
331.5 RESOURCES
The reporting officer should inform victims of identity theft that the California Identity Theft Registry
is available to help those who are wrongly linked to crimes. The registry can be checked by law
enforcement and other authorized persons to investigate whether a criminal history or want was
created in the victim's name (Penal Code § 530.7). Information regarding the California Identity
Theft Registry can be obtained by calling toll free (888) 880-0240.
331.6 FOLLOW UP
Following supervisory review and departmental processing, the initial report should be forwarded
to the appropriate detective for follow up investigation, coordination with other agencies and
prosecution as circumstances dictate.

Communications with Persons with Disabilities
332.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidance to members when communicating with individuals with disabilities,
including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, have impaired speech or vision, or are blind.
332.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Auxiliary aids - Tools used to communicate with people who have a disability or impairment. They
include, but are not limited to, the use of gestures or visual aids to supplement oral communication;
a notepad and pen or pencil to exchange written notes; a computer or typewriter; an assistive
listening system or device to amplify sound; a teletypewriter (TTY) or videophones (video relay
service or VRS); taped text; qualified readers; or a qualified interpreter.
Disability or impairment - A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life
activity, including hearing or seeing, regardless of whether the disabled person uses assistive or
adaptive devices or auxiliary aids. Individuals who wear ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses are
not considered to have a disability (42 USC § 12102).
Qualified interpreter - A person who is able to interpret effectively, accurately and impartially,
both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. Qualified
interpreters include oral interpreters, translators, sign language interpreters and intermediary
interpreters.
332.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to reasonably ensure that people with disabilities,
including victims, witnesses, suspects and arrestees have equal access to law enforcement
services, programs and activities. Members must make efforts to communicate effectively with
individuals with disabilities.
The Department will not discriminate against or deny any individual access to services, rights or
programs based upon disabilities.
332.3 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES (ADA) COORDINATOR
The Chief of Police shall delegate certain responsibilities to the Audit and Inspection Sergeant,
who shall act as the ADA Coordinator (28 CFR 35.107). The ADA Coordinator shall be directly
responsible to the Professional Standards Division Captain or his/her designee.
The responsibilities of the ADA Coordinator shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) Working with the City ADA coordinator regarding the Berkeley Police Department’s
efforts to ensure equal access to services, programs and activities.
(b) Developing reports, new procedures, or recommending modifications to this policy.
(c) Acting as a liaison with local disability advocacy groups or other disability groups
regarding access to department services, programs and activities.
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved.
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department - 218Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
(d) Ensuring that a list of qualified interpreter services is maintained and available to each
Watch Commander and Communications Center Manager. The list should include
information regarding the following:
1. Contact information
2. Availability
(e) Developing procedures that will enable members to access auxiliary aids or services,
including qualified interpreters, and ensure the procedures are available to all
members.
(f) Ensuring signage is posted in appropriate areas, indicating that auxiliary aids are
available free of charge to people with disabilities.
(g) Ensuring appropriate processes are in place to provide for the prompt and equitable
resolution of complaints and inquiries regarding discrimination in access to department
services, programs and activities.
332.4 FACTORS TO CONSIDER
Because the nature of any law enforcement contact may vary substantially from one situation
to the next, members of this department should consider all information reasonably available to
them when determining how to communicate with an individual with a disability. Members should
carefully balance all known factors in an effort to reasonably ensure people who are disabled have
equal access to services, programs and activities. These factors may include, but are not limited to:
(a) Members should not always assume that effective communication is being achieved.
The fact that an individual appears to be nodding in agreement does not always mean
he/she completely understands the message. When there is any doubt, members
should ask the individual to communicate back or otherwise demonstrate their
understanding.
(b) The nature of the disability (e.g., deafness or blindness vs. hard of hearing or low
vision).
(c) The nature of the law enforcement contact (e.g., emergency vs. non-emergency,
custodial vs. consensual contact).
(d) The availability of auxiliary aids. The fact that a particular aid is not available does
not eliminate the obligation to reasonably ensure access. However, in an emergency,
availability may factor into the type of aid used.
332.5 INITIAL AND IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATIONS
Recognizing that various law enforcement encounters may be potentially volatile and/or
emotionally charged, members should remain alert to the possibility of communication problems.
Members should exercise special care in the use of all gestures, and verbal and written
communication to minimize initial confusion and misunderstanding when dealing with any
individual with known or suspected disabilities.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Communications with Persons with Disabilities
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department - 219Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
In a non-emergency situation, when a member knows or suspects an individual requires
assistance to effectively communicate, the member shall identify the individual’s choice of auxiliary
aid or service.
The individual’s preferred communication method must be honored unless another effective
method of communication exists under the circumstances (28 CFR 35.160).
Factors to consider when determining whether an alternative method is effective include:
(a) The methods of communication usually used by the individual.
(b) The nature, length and complexity of the communication involved.
(c) The context of the communication.
In emergency situations involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of any person,
members may use whatever auxiliary aids and services that reasonably appear effective under
the circumstances. This may include, for example, exchanging written notes or using the services
of a person who knows sign language but is not a qualified interpreter, even if the person who is
deaf or hard of hearing would prefer a qualified sign language interpreter or another appropriate
auxiliary aid or service. Once the emergency has ended, the continued method of communication
should be reconsidered. The member should inquire as to the individual's preference and give
primary consideration to that preference.
If an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing or has impaired speech must be handcuffed while in
the custody of the Berkeley Police Department, consideration should be given, safety permitting,
to placing the handcuffs in the front of the body to facilitate communication using sign language
or writing.
332.6 TYPES OF ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE
Berkeley Police Department members shall never refuse to assist an individual with disabilities
who is requesting assistance. The Department will not charge anyone to receive auxiliary aids, nor
shall they require anyone to furnish their own auxiliary aid or service as a condition for receiving
assistance. The Department will make every reasonable effort to provide equal access and timely
assistance to individuals who are disabled through a variety of services.
A person who is disabled may choose to accept department-provided auxiliary aids or services
or they may choose to provide their own.
Department-provided auxiliary aids or services may include, but are not limited to, the assistance
methods described in this policy.
332.7 AUDIO RECORDINGS AND ENLARGED PRINT
The Department may develop audio recordings to assist people who are blind or have a visual
impairment with accessing important information. If such a recording is not available, members
may read aloud from the appropriate form, for example a personnel complaint form, or provide
forms with enlarged print.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
332.8 QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS
A qualified interpreter may be needed in lengthy or complex transactions (e.g., interviewing a
victim, witness, suspect or arrestee), if the individual to be interviewed normally relies on sign
language or speechreading (lip-reading) to understand what others are saying. The qualified
interpreter should not be a person with an interest in the case or investigation involving the disabled
individual. A person providing interpretation services may be required to establish the accuracy
and trustworthiness of the interpretation in a court proceeding.
Qualified interpreters should be:
(a) Available within a reasonable amount of time but in no event longer than one hour
if requested.
(b) Experienced in providing interpretation services related to law enforcement matters.
(c) Familiar with the use of VRS and/or video remote interpreting services.
(d) Certified in either American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed English (SE).
(e) Able to understand and adhere to the interpreter role without deviating into other roles,
such as counselor or legal adviser.
(f) Knowledgeable of the ethical issues involved when providing interpreter services.
Members should use department-approved procedures to request a qualified interpreter at the
earliest reasonable opportunity, and generally not more than 15 minutes after a request for an
interpreter has been made or it is reasonably apparent that an interpreter is needed. No individual
who is disabled shall be required to provide his/her own interpreter (28 CFR 35.160).
332.9 TTY AND RELAY SERVICES
In situations where an individual without a disability would have access to a telephone (e.g.,
booking or attorney contacts), members must also provide those who are deaf, hard of hearing
or have impaired speech the opportunity to place calls using an available TTY (also known as a
telecommunications device for deaf people, or TDD). Members shall provide additional time, as
needed, for effective communication due to the slower nature of TTY and TDD communications.
The Department will accept all TTY or TDD calls placed by those who are deaf or hard of hearing
and received via a telecommunications relay service (28 CFR 35.162).
Note that relay services translate verbatim, so the conversation must be conducted as if speaking
directly to the caller.
332.10 COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS
Interpreter services may be available from community volunteers who have demonstrated
competence in communication services, such as ASL or SE, and have been approved by the
Department to provide interpreter services.
Where qualified interpreters are unavailable to assist, approved community volunteers who have
demonstrated competence may be called upon when appropriate. However, department members
must carefully consider the nature of the contact and the relationship between the individual with
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Communications with Persons with Disabilities
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department - 221Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
the disability and the volunteer to ensure that the volunteer can provide neutral and unbiased
assistance.
332.11 FAMILY AND FRIENDS
While family or friends may offer to assist with interpretation, members should carefully consider
the circumstances before relying on such individuals. The nature of the contact and relationship
between the individual with the disability and the person offering services must be carefully
considered (e.g., victim/suspect).
Children shall not be relied upon except in emergency or critical situations when there is no
qualified interpreter reasonably available.
Adults may be relied upon when (28 CFR 35.160):
(a) There is an emergency or critical situation and there is no qualified interpreter
reasonably available.
(b) The person with the disability requests that the adult interpret or facilitate
communication and the adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance on that
adult for such assistance is reasonable under the circumstances.
332.12 REPORTING
Whenever any member of this department is required to complete a report or other documentation,
and communication assistance has been provided, such services should be noted in the related
report. Members should document the type of communication services utilized and whether the
individual elected to use services provided by the Department or some other identified source.
If the individual’s express preference is not honored, the member must document why another
method of communication was used.
All written communications exchanged in a criminal case shall be attached to the report or placed
into evidence.
332.13 FIELD ENFORCEMENT
Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, serving
warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field contacts that may
involve individuals with disabilities. The scope and nature of these activities and contacts will
inevitably vary.
The Department recognizes that it would be virtually impossible to provide immediate access
to complete communication services to every member of this department. Members and/or
supervisors must assess each situation and consider the length, complexity and importance of the
communication, as well as the individual’s preferred method of communication, when determining
the type of resources to use and whether a qualified interpreter is needed.
Although not every situation can be addressed in this policy, it is important that members are able
to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the need for information and the meaning
or consequences of any enforcement action. For example, it would be meaningless to verbally
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Communications with Persons with Disabilities
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department - 222Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
request consent to search if the officer is unable to effectively communicate with an individual who
is deaf or hard of hearing and requires communications assistance.
If available, officers should obtain the assistance of a qualified interpreter before placing an
individual with a disability under arrest. Individuals who are arrested and are assisted by service
animals should be permitted to make arrangements for the care of such animals prior to transport.
332.13.1 FIELD RESOURCES
Examples of methods that may be sufficient for transactions, such as checking a license or giving
directions to a location or for urgent situations such as responding to a violent crime in progress,
may, depending on the circumstances, include such simple things as:
(a) Hand gestures or visual aids with an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing or has
impaired speech.
(b) Exchange of written notes or communications.
(c) Verbal communication with an individual who can speechread by facing the individual
and speaking slowly and clearly.
(d) Use of computer, word processing, personal communication device or similar device
to exchange texts or notes.
(e) Slowly and clearly speaking or reading simple terms to individuals who have a visual
or mental impairment.
Members should be aware that these techniques may not provide effective communication as
required by law and this policy depending on the circumstances.
332.14 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS
In an effort to ensure that the rights of individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech
impairment are protected during a custodial interrogation, this department will provide interpreter
services before beginning an interrogation, unless exigent circumstances exist or the individual
has made a clear indication that he/she understands the process and desires to proceed without
an interpreter. The use of a video remote interpreting service should be considered, where
appropriate, if a live interpreter is not available. Miranda warnings shall be provided to suspects
who are deaf or hard of hearing by a qualified interpreter or by providing a written Miranda warning
card.
In order to ensure that communications during custodial investigations are accurately documented
and are admissible as evidence, interrogations should be recorded whenever reasonably possible.
See guidance on recording custodial interrogations in the Investigation and Prosecution Policy.
332.15 ARREST AND BOOKINGS
If an individual with speech or hearing disabilities is arrested, the arresting officer shall use
department-approved procedures to provide a qualified interpreter at the place of arrest or
booking as soon as reasonably practicable, unless the individual indicates that he/she prefers a
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Communications with Persons with Disabilities

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communications with Persons with Disabilities
different auxiliary aid or service or the officer reasonably determines another effective method of
communication exists under the circumstances.
When gathering information during the booking process, members should remain alert to the
impediments that often exist when communicating with those who are deaf, hard of hearing,
who have impaired speech or vision, are blind, or have other disabilities. In the interest of the
arrestee’s health and welfare, the safety and security of the facility and to protect individual
rights, it is important that accurate medical screening and booking information be obtained. If
necessary, members should seek the assistance of a qualified interpreter whenever there is
concern that accurate information cannot be obtained or that booking instructions may not be
properly understood by the individual.
Individuals who require and possess personally owned communication aids (e.g., hearing aids,
cochlear processors) should be permitted to retain them while in custody.
332.16 COMPLAINTS
Pursuant to the City of Berkeley’s ADA Grievance procedure (AR 1.13, as it may be amended
from time to time) the Department shall investigate any complaint against the Department or its
employees which alleges denial of accommodation or non-compliance with disability related civil
rights laws with respect to the Department's services and programs. AR 1.13 should be referred
to for more details. Generally, however, any individual who disputes a disability-related action or
omission of the Department or of an employee of the Department may discuss his/her complaint
with the ADA Coordinator. The ADA Coordinator may consult with the City's Disability Compliance
Coordinator. The ADA Coordinator shall maintain on file (for a period of three years) any record
of the dispute including any findings, recommendations and/or the outcome.
If the dispute is not resolved to the complainant's satisfaction, he or she may file a complaint with
the City's Disability Compliance Coordinator. Pursuant to BMC 3.32.090, as it may be amended
from time to time, such complaints may also be filed with the Police Review Commission.
332.17 COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Community outreach programs and other such services offered by this department are important
to the ultimate success of more traditional law enforcement duties. This department will continue
to work with community groups, local businesses and neighborhoods to provide equal access to
such programs and services.
332.18 TRAINING
To ensure that all members who may have contact with individuals who are disabled are properly
trained, the Department will provide periodic training that should include:
(a) Awareness and understanding of this policy and related procedures, related forms and
available resources.
(b) Procedures for accessing qualified interpreters and other available resources.
(c) Working with in-person and telephone interpreters and related equipment.

The Personnel and Training Sergeant shall be responsible for ensuring new members receive
training related to interacting with individuals who have disabilities, including individuals who are
deaf, hard of hearing, who have impaired speech or vision, or are blind. Those who may have
contact with such individuals should receive refresher training at least once every two years
thereafter. The Personnel and Training Sergeant shall maintain records of all training provided,
and will retain a copy in each member’s training file in accordance with established records
retention schedules.
332.18.1 CALL-TAKER TRAINING
Emergency call-takers shall be trained in the use of TTY equipment protocols for communicating
with individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech impairments. Such training
and information should include:
(a) The requirements of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for telephone
emergency service providers.
(b) ASL syntax and accepted abbreviations.
(c) Practical instruction on identifying and processing TTY or TDD calls, including the
importance of recognizing silent TTY or TDD calls, using proper syntax, abbreviations
and protocol when responding to TTY or TDD calls.
(d) Hands-on experience in TTY and TDD communications, including identification of TTY
or TDD tones.
Training should be mandatory for all the Communications Center members who may have contact
with individuals from the public who are deaf, hard of hearing or have impaired speech. Refresher
training should occur every six months.

Private Persons Arrests
333.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the handling of private person’s arrests made
pursuant to Penal Code § 837.
333.2 ADVISING PRIVATE PERSONS OF THE ARREST PROCESS
Penal Code § 836(b) expressly mandates that all officers shall advise victims of domestic violence
of the right to make a private person’s arrest, including advice on how to safely execute such an
arrest. In all other situations, officers should use sound discretion in determining whether or not
to advise an individual of the arrest process.
(a) When advising any individual regarding the right to make a private person’s arrest,
officers should refrain from encouraging or dissuading any individual from making such
an arrest and should instead limit advice to the legal requirements for such an arrest
as listed below.
(b) Private individuals should be discouraged from using force to effect a private person’s
arrest, and absent immediate threat to their own safety or the safety of others, private
individuals should be encouraged to refer matters to law enforcement officials for
further investigation or arrest.
333.3 ARRESTS BY PRIVATE PERSONS
Penal Code § 837 provides that a private person may arrest another:
(a) For a public offense committed or attempted in his or her presence;
(b) When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his or her presence;
(c) When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for
believing the person arrested has committed it.
Unlike peace officers, private persons may not make an arrest on suspicion that a felony has been
committed - the felony must in fact have taken place.
333.4 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
Any officer presented with a private person wishing to make an arrest must determine whether or
not there is reasonable cause to believe that such an arrest would be lawful (Penal Code § 847).
(a) Should any officer determine that there is no reasonable cause to believe that a private
person’s arrest is lawful, the officer should take no action to further detain or restrain
the individual beyond that which reasonably appears necessary to investigate the
matter, determine the lawfulness of the arrest and protect the public safety.
1. Any officer who confirms that a private person's arrest is unlawful shall promptly
release the arrested individual pursuant to Penal Code § 849(b)(1). The officer
must include the basis of such a determination in a related report.
2. Absent reasonable cause to support a private person’s arrest or other lawful
grounds to support an independent arrest by the officer, the officer should

Private Persons Arrests
advise the parties that no arrest will be made and that the circumstances will be
documented in a related report.
(b) Whenever an officer determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a private
person’s arrest is lawful, the officer may exercise any of the following options:
1. Take the individual into physical custody for booking
2. Release the individual pursuant to a Notice to Appear
3. Release the individual pursuant to Penal Code § 849
333.5 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
In all circumstances in which a private person is claiming to have made an arrest, the individual
must complete and sign a BPD Private Person's Arrest Form under penalty of perjury.
In addition to the Private Person’s Arrest Form (and any other related documents such as citations,
booking forms, etc.), officers shall complete a report regarding the circumstances and disposition
of the incident.

Definitions related to this policy include:
Authorized interpreter - A person who has been screened and authorized by the Department to
act as an interpreter and/or translator for others.
Interpret or interpretation - The act of listening to a communication in one language (source
language) and orally converting it to another language (target language), while retaining the same
meaning.
Limited English proficient (LEP) - Any individual whose primary language is not English and
who has a limited ability to read, write, speak or understand English. These individuals may be
competent in certain types of communication (e.g., speaking or understanding) but still be LEP
for other purposes (e.g., reading or writing). Similarly, LEP designations are context-specific; an
individual may possess sufficient English language skills to function in one setting but these skills
may be insufficient in other situations.
Qualified bilingual member - A member of the Berkeley Police Department, designated by the
Department, who has the ability to communicate fluently, directly and accurately in both English
and another language. Bilingual members may be fluent enough to communicate in a non-English
language but may not be sufficiently fluent to interpret or translate from one language into another.
Translate or translation - The replacement of written text from one language (source language)
into an equivalent written text (target language).
335.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to reasonably ensure that LEP individuals have
meaningful access to law enforcement services, programs and activities, while not imposing undue
burdens on its members.
The Department will not discriminate against or deny any individual access to services, rights or
programs based upon national origin or any other protected interest or right.
335.3 LEP COORDINATOR
The Communications Center Manager is the designated LEP Coordinator.
The responsibilities of the LEP Coordinator include, but are not limited to:
(a) Coordinating and implementing all aspects of the Berkeley Police Department’s LEP
services to LEP individuals.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Limited English Proficiency Services - 229
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Limited English Proficiency Services
(b) Developing procedures that will enable members to access LEP services, including
telephonic interpreters, and ensuring the procedures are available to all members.
(c) Ensuring that a list of all qualified bilingual members and authorized interpreters is
maintained and available to each Watch Commander and Communications Center
Manager. The list should include information regarding the following:
1. Languages spoken
2. Contact information
3. Availability
(d) Ensuring signage stating that interpreters are available free of charge to LEP
individuals is posted in appropriate areas and in the most commonly spoken
languages.
(e) Reviewing existing and newly developed documents to determine which are vital
documents and should be translated, and into which languages the documents should
be translated.
(f) Annually assessing demographic data and other resources, including contracted
language services utilization data and community-based organizations, to determine
if there are additional documents or languages that are appropriate for translation.
(g) Identifying standards and assessments to be used by the Department to qualify
individuals as qualified bilingual members or authorized interpreters.
(h) Periodically reviewing efforts of the Department in providing meaningful access
to LEP individuals, and, as appropriate, developing reports, new procedures or
recommending modifications to this policy.
(i) Receiving and responding to complaints regarding department LEP services.
(j) Ensuring appropriate processes are in place to provide for the prompt and equitable
resolution of complaints and inquiries regarding discrimination in access to department
services, programs and activities.
335.4 FOUR-FACTOR ANALYSIS
Since there are many different languages that members could encounter, the Department will
utilize the four-factor analysis outlined in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Guidance to
Federal Financial Assistance Recipients, available at the DOJ website, to determine which
measures will provide meaningful access to its services and programs. It is recognized that law
enforcement contacts and circumstances will vary considerably. This analysis, therefore, must
remain flexible and will require an ongoing balance of four factors, which are:
1. The number or proportion of LEP individuals eligible to be served or likely to be
encountered by department members, or who may benefit from programs or services
within the jurisdiction of the Department or a particular geographic area.
2. The frequency with which LEP individuals are likely to come in contact with department
members, programs or services.
3. The nature and importance of the contact, program, information or service provided.

Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Limited English Proficiency Services
4. The cost of providing LEP assistance and the resources available.
335.5 TYPES OF LEP ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE
Berkeley Police Department members should never refuse service to an LEP individual who is
requesting assistance, nor should they require an LEP individual to furnish an interpreter as a
condition for receiving assistance. The Department will make every reasonable effort to provide
meaningful and timely assistance to LEP individuals through a variety of services.
The Department will utilize all reasonably available tools, such as language identification cards,
when attempting to determine an LEP individual's primary language.
LEP individuals may choose to accept department-provided LEP services at no cost or they may
choose to provide their own.
Department-provided LEP services may include, but are not limited to, the assistance methods
described in this policy.
335.6 WRITTEN FORMS AND GUIDELINES
Vital documents or those that are frequently used should be translated into languages most likely to
be encountered. The LEP Coordinator will arrange to make these translated documents available
to members and other appropriate individuals, as necessary.
335.7 AUDIO RECORDINGS
The Department may develop audio recordings of important or frequently requested information
in a language most likely to be understood by those LEP individuals who are representative of
the community being served.
335.8 QUALIFIED BILINGUAL MEMBERS
Bilingual members may be qualified to provide LEP services when they have demonstrated
through established department procedures a sufficient level of skill and competence to fluently
communicate in both English and a non-English language. Members utilized for LEP services
must demonstrate knowledge of the functions of an interpreter/translator and the ethical issues
involved when acting as a language conduit. Additionally, bilingual members must be able to
communicate technical and law enforcement terminology, and be sufficiently proficient in the
non-English language to perform complicated tasks, such as conducting interrogations, taking
statements, collecting evidence or conveying rights or responsibilities.
When a qualified bilingual member from this department is not available, personnel from other
City departments, who have been identified by the Department as having the requisite skills and
competence, may be requested.
335.9 AUTHORIZED INTERPRETERS
Any person designated by the Department to act as an authorized interpreter and/or translator
must have demonstrated competence in both English and the involved non-English language,
must have an understanding of the functions of an interpreter that allows for correct and effective
translation, and should not be a person with an interest in the department case or investigation
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Limited English Proficiency Services - 231
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Limited English Proficiency Services
involving the LEP individual. A person providing interpretation or translation services may be
required to establish the accuracy and trustworthiness of the interpretation or translation in a court
proceeding.
Authorized interpreters must pass a screening process established by the City of Berkeley's
Human Resources Department which demonstrates that their skills and abilities include:
(a) The competence and ability to communicate information accurately in both English
and in the target language.
(b) Knowledge, in both languages, of any specialized terms or concepts peculiar to this
department and of any particularized vocabulary or phraseology used by the LEP
individual.
(c) The ability to understand and adhere to the interpreter role without deviating into other
roles, such as counselor or legal adviser.
(d) Knowledge of the ethical issues involved when acting as a language conduit.
335.9.1 SOURCES OF AUTHORIZED INTERPRETERS
The Department may contract with authorized interpreters who are available over the telephone.
Members may use these services with the approval of a supervisor and in compliance with
established procedures.
Other sources may include:
• Qualified bilingual members of this department or personnel from other City
departments.
• Individuals employed exclusively to perform interpretation services.
• Contracted in-person interpreters, such as state or federal court interpreters, among
others.
• Interpreters from other agencies.
335.9.2 COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS AND OTHER SOURCES OF LANGUAGE
ASSISTANCE
Language assistance may be available from community volunteers who have demonstrated
competence in either monolingual (direct) communication and/or in interpretation or translation (as
noted in above), and have been approved by the Department to communicate with LEP individuals.
Where qualified bilingual members or other authorized interpreters are unavailable to assist,
approved community volunteers who have demonstrated competence may be called upon when
appropriate. However, department members must carefully consider the nature of the contact and
the relationship between the LEP individual and the volunteer to ensure that the volunteer can
provide neutral and unbiased assistance.
While family or friends of an LEP individual may offer to assist with communication or
interpretation, members should carefully consider the circumstances before relying on such
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Limited English Proficiency Services - 232

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Limited English Proficiency Services
individuals. For example, children should not be relied upon except in exigent or very informal and
non-confrontational situations.
335.10 CONTACT AND REPORTING
While all law enforcement contacts, services and individual rights are important, this department
will utilize the four-factor analysis to prioritize service to LEP individuals so that such services may
be targeted where they are most needed, according to the nature and importance of the particular
law enforcement activity involved.
Whenever any member of this department is required to complete a report or other documentation,
and interpretation services are provided to any involved LEP individual, such services should be
noted in the related report. Members should document the type of interpretation services utilized
and whether the individual elected to use services provided by the Department or some other
identified source.
335.11 RECEIVING AND RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE
The Berkeley Police Department will take reasonable steps and will work with the Personnel and
Training Bureau to develop in-house language capacity by hiring or appointing qualified members
proficient in languages representative of the community being served.
335.11.1 EMERGENCY CALLS TO 9-1-1
Department members will make every reasonable effort to promptly accommodate LEP individuals
utilizing 9-1-1 lines. When a 9-1-1 call-taker receives a call and determines that the caller is an LEP
individual, the call-taker shall quickly determine whether sufficient information can be obtained to
initiate an appropriate emergency response. If language assistance is still needed, the language
is known and a qualified bilingual member is available in the Communications Center, the call
shall immediately be handled by the qualified bilingual member.
If a qualified bilingual member is not available or the call-taker is unable to identify the caller’s
language, the call-taker will contact the contracted telephone interpretation service and establish
a three-way call between the call-taker, the LEP individual and the interpreter.
Dispatchers will make every reasonable effort to dispatch a qualified bilingual member to the
assignment, if available and appropriate.
While 9-1-1 calls shall receive top priority, reasonable efforts should also be made to
accommodate LEP individuals seeking routine access to services and information by utilizing the
resources listed in this policy.
335.12 FIELD ENFORCEMENT
Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, serving
warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field contacts that may
involve LEP individuals. The scope and nature of these activities and contacts will inevitably vary.
Members and/or supervisors must assess each situation to determine the need and availability of
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Limited English Proficiency Services - 233
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Limited English Proficiency Services
language assistance to all involved LEP individuals and utilize the methods outlined in this policy
to provide such assistance.
Although not every situation can be addressed in this policy, it is important that members are able
to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the need for information and the meaning
or consequences of any enforcement action. For example, it would be meaningless to request
consent to search if the officer is unable to effectively communicate with an LEP individual.
If available, officers should obtain the assistance of a qualified bilingual member or an authorized
interpreter before placing an LEP individual under arrest.
335.13 INVESTIGATIVE FIELD INTERVIEWS
In any situation where an interview may reveal information that could be used as the basis for
arrest or prosecution of an LEP individual and a qualified bilingual member is unavailable or
lacks the skills to directly communicate with the LEP individual, an authorized interpreter should
be used. This includes interviews conducted during an investigation with victims, witnesses and
suspects. In such situations, audio recordings of the interviews should be made when reasonably
possible. Identification and contact information for the interpreter (e.g., name, address) should be
documented so that the person can be subpoenaed for trial if necessary.
If an authorized interpreter is needed, officers should consider calling for an authorized interpreter
in the following order:
• An authorized department member or allied agency interpreter
• An authorized telephone interpreter
• Any other authorized interpreter
Any Miranda warnings shall be provided to suspects in their primary language by an authorized
interpreter or, if the suspect is literate, by providing a translated Miranda warning card.
The use of an LEP individual’s bilingual friends, family members, children, neighbors or bystanders
may be used only when a qualified bilingual member or authorized interpreter is unavailable and
there is an immediate need to interview an LEP individual.
335.14 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS
Miscommunication during custodial interrogations may have a substantial impact on the evidence
presented in a criminal prosecution. Only qualified bilingual members or, if none is available
or appropriate, authorized interpreters shall be used during custodial interrogations. Miranda
warnings shall be provided to suspects in their primary language by the qualified bilingual member
or an authorized interpreter.
In order to ensure that translations during custodial interrogations are accurately documented and
are admissible as evidence, interrogations should be recorded whenever reasonably possible.
See guidance on recording custodial interrogations in the Investigation and Prosecution Policy.

335.15 BOOKINGS
When gathering information during the booking process, members should remain alert to the
impediments that language barriers can create. In the interest of the arrestee’s health and welfare,
the safety and security of the facility, and to protect individual rights, it is important that accurate
medical screening and booking information be obtained. Members should seek the assistance
of a qualified bilingual member whenever there is concern that accurate information cannot be
obtained or that booking instructions may not be properly understood by an LEP individual.
335.16 COMPLAINTS
The Department shall ensure that LEP individuals who wish to file a complaint regarding members
of this department are able to do so. The Department may provide an authorized interpreter or
translated forms, as appropriate. Complaints will be referred to the Internal Affairs Bureau.
Investigations into such complaints shall be handled in accordance with the Personnel Complaints
Policy. Authorized interpreters used for any interview with an LEP individual during an investigation
should not be members of this department.
Any notice required to be sent to an LEP individual as a complaining party pursuant to the
Personnel Complaints Policy should be translated or otherwise communicated in a language-
accessible manner.
335.17 COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Community outreach programs and other such services offered by this department are important
to the ultimate success of more traditional law enforcement duties. This department will continue
to work with community groups, local businesses and neighborhoods to provide equal access to
such programs and services.
335.18 TRAINING
To ensure that all members who may have contact with LEP individuals are properly trained,
the Department will provide periodic training on this policy and related procedures, including
how to access department-authorized telephonic and in-person interpreters and other available
resources.
The Personnel and Training Sergeant shall be responsible for ensuring new members receive LEP
training. Those who may have contact with LEP individuals should receive refresher training at
least once every two years thereafter. The Personnel and Training Sergeant shall maintain records
of all LEP training provided, and will retain a copy in each member’s training file in accordance
with established records retention schedules.

Biological Samples
337.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for the collection of biological samples from those individuals
required to provide samples upon conviction or arrest for certain offenses. This policy does not
apply to biological samples collected at a crime scene or taken from a person in conjunction with
a criminal investigation. Nor does it apply to biological samples from those required to register,
for example, sex offenders.
337.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department will assist in the expeditious collection of required biological
samples from offenders in accordance with the laws of this state. Should force be necessary in
order to obtain a sample, officers should only use the minimum amount of force necessary.
337.3 PERSONS SUBJECT TO DNA COLLECTION
Those who must submit a biological sample include (Penal Code § 296):
(a) A person, including a juvenile, upon conviction or other adjudication of any felony
offense.
(b) A person, including a juvenile, upon conviction or other adjudication of any offense if
the person has a prior felony on record.
(c) An adult arrested or charged with any felony.
337.4 PROCEDURE
When an individual is required to provide a biological sample, a trained employee shall obtain the
sample in accordance with this policy.
337.4.1 COLLECTION
The following steps should be taken to collect a sample:
(a) Verify that the individual is required to provide a sample pursuant to Penal Code §
296; Penal Code § 296.1.
(b) Verify that a biological sample has not been previously collected from the offender
by querying the individual’s criminal history record for a DNA collection flag or, during
regular business hours, calling the California Department of Justice (DOJ) designated
DNA laboratory. There is no need to obtain a biological sample if one has been
previously obtained.
(c) Use a DNA buccal swab collection kit provided by the California DOJ to perform the
collection and take steps to avoid cross contamination.
337.5 INVOLUNTARY DNA COLLECTION
If a person refuses to cooperate with the sample collection process, officers should attempt to
identify the reason for refusal and seek voluntary compliance without resorting to using force.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Biological Samples - 238
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Biological Samples
Force will not be used in the collection of samples except as authorized by a court order or with
the approval of the Watch Commander.
The following employees shall be involved in the administration of an involuntary DNA collection
procedure:
(a) A sworn supervisor,
(b) An assigned officer and
(c) An assisting employee.
The incident supervisor shall involve as many assisting employees as may be required to ensure
the restraint of the individual and to accomplish the DNA collection. The incident supervisor
shall explain to the individual that their refusal will result in his/her physical restraint, and that
reasonable force may be employed to promote the safety of all involved parties during the
impending collection.
337.5.1 RESTRAINT EQUIPMENT
When available and practical, restraint equipment should be employed if its use would enhance
the safety of persons involved in an involuntary DNA collection process.
“Restraint equipment”, as used in this policy, may include, but is not limited to, a padded
phlebotomy chair, a hospital gurney equipped with soft-restraints and “The Wrap” restraint device.
The use of restraint equipment shall not preclude the physical restraint of an individual’s person
by an employee if such action is necessary to mitigate the potential for injury.
The incident supervisor shall monitor the restraint process to ensure only reasonable force is
employed. If confronted with violent resistance, the incident supervisor may elect to terminate the
procedure, and develop an alternate plan for the DNA collection.
Should employees use physical force to overcome an individual’s violent resistance to the DNA
collection process, the incident supervisor shall adhere to the reporting protocols in the Use of
Force Policy. The arresting officer shall document the conduct of the individual during the DNA
collection procedure in his/her report.
In the event an individual is injured, or complains of injury, as a result of police action, the incident
supervisor shall ensure medical service protocols are followed.
337.5.2 VIDEO RECORDING
A video recording shall be made anytime force is used to obtain a biological sample. The recording
should document all staff participating in the process, in addition to the methods and all force used
during the collection. The recording should be part of the investigation file, if any, or otherwise
retained in accordance with the department’s records retention schedule (15 CCR 1059).
337.5.3 CELL EXTRACTIONS
If the use of force includes a cell extraction, the extraction shall be video recorded, including audio.
Video shall be directed at the cell extraction event. The video recording shall be retained by the
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Biological Samples - 239
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Biological Samples
Department for the length of time required by statute. Notwithstanding the use of the video as
evidence in a criminal proceeding, the tape shall be retained administratively (15 CCR 1059).
337.6 LEGAL MANDATES AND RELEVANT LAWS
California law provides for the following:
337.6.1 DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO FORCE
The Watch Commander shall prepare prior written authorization for the use of any force (15 CCR
1059). The written authorization (the BPD "Upgraded Search and DNA Collection Request" form)
shall include information that the individual was asked to provide the requisite specimen, sample
or impression and refused, and if applicable, the related court order authorizing the force.
337.6.2 BLOOD SAMPLES
A blood sample should only be obtained under this policy when:
(a) The California DOJ requests a blood sample and the individual consents, or
(b) A court orders a blood sample following a refusal.
The withdrawal of blood may only be performed in a medically approved manner by health care
providers trained and qualified to draw blood. A California DOJ collection kit shall be used for this
purpose (Penal Code § 298(a); Penal Code § 298(b)(2)).
337.6.3 LITIGATION
The Chief of Police or authorized designee should notify the California DOJ’s DNA Legal Unit in
the event this department is named in a lawsuit involving the DNA Data Bank sample collection,
sample use or any aspect of the state’s DNA Data Bank Program.
337.7 EXPUNGEMENT FROM CAL-DNA DATA BANK
California Penal Code § 299 sets forth the criteria for DNA Database sample expungement.
Expungement can be accomplished easily and quickly when a DNA sample qualifies for removal
from the State database and a person provides sufficient documentation of his/ her identity, legal
status and criminal history to the California Department of Justice, DNA Database Program (CAL-
DNA). A petitioner whose sample qualifies for DNA database sample expungement and who
provides appropriate documentation can expedite the process so that neither a court hearing, nor
a 180-day waiting period permitted by Section 299, likely will be necessary.
If CAL-DNA receives sufficient documentation showing that an individual meets the criteria for
expungement of his or her DNA sample, CAL-DNA will review and research the request and
issue a response to the petitioner indicating that the expungement was completed and the sample
destroyed, or notify the petitioner of the legal reason the Department is required to retain the
sample and profile.
A form to request CAL-DNA to expunge a DNA database sample and profile can be obtained by
contacting the California Office of the Attorney General. The Attorney General’s website is https://
oag.ca.gov or a petitioner can call 800-952-5225. The form to request the expungement is the

Child and Dependent Adult Safety
340.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines to ensure that children and dependent adults are not left without
appropriate care in the event their caregiver or guardian is arrested or otherwise prevented from
providing care due to actions taken by members of this department (Penal Code § 833.2(a)).
This policy does not address the actions to be taken during the course of a child abuse or
dependent adult investigation. These are covered in the Child Abuse and Adult Abuse policies.
340.2 POLICY
It is the policy of this department to mitigate, to the extent reasonably possible, the stressful
experience individuals may have when their parent or caregiver is arrested. The Berkeley Police
Department will endeavor to create a strong, cooperative relationship with local, state and
community-based social services to ensure an effective, collaborative response that addresses
the needs of those affected, including call-out availability and follow-up responsibilities.
340.3 PROCEDURES DURING AN ARREST
When encountering an arrest or prolonged detention situation, officers should make reasonable
attempts to determine if the arrestee is responsible for children or dependent adults. In some
cases this may be obvious, such as when children or dependent adults are present. However,
officers should inquire if the arrestee has caregiver responsibilities for any children or dependent
adults who are without appropriate supervision. The following steps should be taken (Penal Code
§ 13517.7(b)(1)):
(a) Inquire about and confirm the location of any children or dependent adults.
(b) Look for evidence of children and dependent adults. Officers should be mindful that
some arrestees may conceal the fact that they have a dependent for fear the individual
may be taken from them.
(c) Consider inquiring of witnesses, neighbors, friends and relatives of the arrestee as to
whether the person is responsible for a child or dependent adult.
Whenever reasonably possible, officers should take reasonable steps to accomplish the arrest of
a parent, guardian or caregiver out of the presence of his/her child or dependent adult. Removing
children or dependent adults from the scene in advance of the arrest will generally ensure the
best outcome for the individual.
Whenever it is safe to do so, officers should allow the parent or caregiver to assure children or
dependent adults that they will be provided care. If this is not safe or if the demeanor of the parent
or caregiver suggests this conversation would be non-productive, the officer at the scene should
explain the reason for the arrest in age-appropriate language and offer reassurance to the child
or dependent adult that he/she will receive appropriate care.

Child and Dependent Adult Safety
340.3.1 AFTER AN ARREST
Whenever an arrest is made, the officer should take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of
the arrestee’s disclosed or discovered children or dependent adults.
Officers should allow the arrestee reasonable time to arrange for care of children and dependent
adults. Temporary placement with family or friends may be appropriate. However, any decision
should give priority to a care solution that is in the best interest of the child or dependent adult. In
such cases the following guidelines should be followed:
(a) Allow the person reasonable time to arrange for the care of children and dependent
adults with a responsible party, as appropriate.
1. Officers should consider allowing the person to use his/her cell phone to facilitate
arrangements through access to contact phone numbers, and to lessen the
likelihood of call screening by the recipients due to calls from unknown sources.
(b) Unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., signs of abuse, drug use, unsafe
environment), officers should respect the parent or caregiver’s judgment regarding
arrangements for care. It is generally best if the child or dependent adult remains
with relatives or family friends that he/she knows and trusts because familiarity with
surroundings and consideration for comfort, emotional state and safety are important.
1. Except when a court order exists limiting contact, the officer should attempt
to locate and place children or dependent adults with the non-arrested parent,
guardian or caregiver.
(c) Provide for the immediate supervision of children or dependent adults until an
appropriate caregiver arrives.
(d) Notify Child Protective Services or Adult Protective Services, if appropriate.
(e) Notify a field supervisor of the disposition of children or dependent adults.
If children or dependent adults are at school or another known location outside the household
at the time of arrest, the arresting officer should attempt to contact the school or other known
location and inform the principal or appropriate responsible adult of the caregiver’s arrest and of
the arrangements being made for the care of the arrestee’s dependent. The result of such actions
should be documented in the associated report.
340.3.2 DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS
During the booking process the arrestee shall be allowed to make additional telephone calls to
relatives or other responsible individuals as is reasonably necessary to arrange for the care of any
child or dependent adult. These telephone calls should be given as soon as practicable and are
in addition to any other telephone calls allowed by law (Penal Code § 851.5(c)).
If an arrestee is unable to resolve the care of any child or dependent adult through this process,
a supervisor should be contacted to determine the appropriate steps to arrange for care. These
steps may include additional telephone calls or contacting a local, county or state services agency.

Child and Dependent Adult Safety
340.3.3 SUPPORT AND COUNSELING REFERRAL
If, in the judgment of the handling officers, the child or dependent adult would benefit from
additional assistance, such as counseling services, contact with a victim advocate or a crisis
telephone number, the appropriate referral information may be provided.
340.4 DEPENDENT WELFARE SERVICES
Whenever an arrestee is unwilling or incapable of arranging for the appropriate care of any
child or dependent adult, the handling officer should contact the appropriate welfare service or
other department-approved social service to determine whether protective custody is appropriate
(Welfare and Institutions Code § 305).
Only when other reasonable options are exhausted should a child or dependent adult be
transported to the police facility, transported in a marked patrol car or taken into formal protective
custody.
Under no circumstances should a child or dependent adult be left unattended or without
appropriate care.
340.5 TRAINING
The Personnel and Training Sergeant is responsible to ensure that all personnel of this department
who may be involved in arrests affecting children or dependent adults receive approved POST-
approved training on effective safety measures when a parent, guardian or caregiver is arrested
(Penal Code § 13517.7).

341.3 SUPERVISION OF VOLUNTEERS
Each volunteer who is accepted to a position with the Department must have a clearly identified
supervisor who is responsible for direct management of that volunteer. This supervisor will be
responsible for day-to-day management and guidance of the work of the volunteer and should be
available to the volunteer for consultation and assistance.
A volunteer may be assigned as and act as a supervisor of other volunteers provided that the
supervising volunteer is under the direct supervision of a paid staff member.
Functional supervision of volunteers is the responsibility of the supervisor in charge of the unit
where the volunteer is assigned. Following are some considerations to keep in mind while
supervising volunteers:
(a) Take the time to introduce volunteers to employees on all levels.
(b) Ensure volunteers have work space and necessary office supplies.
(c) Make sure the work is challenging. Do not hesitate to give them an assignment or task
that will tap these valuable resources.
341.4 CONFIDENTIALITY
With appropriate security clearance, volunteers may have access to confidential information
such as criminal histories or investigative files. Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor
or departmental policy, all information shall be considered confidential. Only that information
specifically identified and approved by authorized personnel shall be released. Confidential
information shall be given only to persons who have a need and a right to know as determined
by departmental policy and supervisory personnel.
Each volunteer will be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement before being given an
assignment with the Department. Subsequent unauthorized disclosure of any confidential
information, verbally, in writing or by any other means, by the volunteer is grounds for immediate
dismissal and possible criminal prosecution.
Volunteers shall not address public gatherings, appear on radio or television, prepare any article
for publication, act as correspondents to a newspaper or other periodical, release or divulge
any information concerning the activities of the Department, or maintain that they represent the
Department in such matters without permission from the proper department personnel.
341.5 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Volunteers will be issued an identification card that must be worn at all times while on-duty. Any
fixed and portable equipment issued by the Department shall be for official and authorized use
only. Any property or equipment issued to a volunteer shall remain the property of the Department
and shall be returned at the termination of service. Loss of the identification card is to be reported
to the on-duty shift supervisor or the Volunteer Coordinator immediately.

or the Volunteer Coordinator. Volunteers shall have no property interests in their continued
appointment. However, if a volunteer is removed for alleged misconduct, the volunteer will be
afforded an opportunity solely to clear his/her name through a liberty interest hearing which shall
be limited to a single appearance before the Chief of Police or authorized designee.
Volunteers may resign from volunteer service with the Department at any time. It is requested
that volunteers who intend to resign provide advance notice of their departure and a reason for
their decision.
341.6.1 EXIT INTERVIEWS
Exit interviews, where possible, should be conducted with volunteers who are leaving their
positions. The interview should ascertain why the volunteer is leaving the position and solicit the
volunteer’s suggestions on improving the position. When appropriate, the interview should also
include a discussion on the possibility of involvement in some other capacity with the Department.
341.7 EVALUATION
An evaluation of the overall volunteer program will be conducted on an annual basis by the
Volunteer Coordinator. Regular evaluations should be conducted with volunteers to ensure the
best use of human resources available, to ensure personnel problems can be identified and dealt

Service Animals
342.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide the guidelines necessary to ensure the rights of individuals
who use service animals to assist with disabilities are protected in accordance with Title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
342.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Service animal - A dog that is trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual
with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual or other mental disability.
The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the individual's
disability (28 CFR 35.104; Health and Safety Code § 113903).
A service animal also includes a miniature horse if the horse is trained to do work or perform tasks
for people with disabilities, provided the horse is housebroken, is under the handler’s control, the
facility can accommodate the horse’s type, size and weight, and the horse’s presence will not
compromise legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility (28 CFR
35.136(i)).
Service Dog in Training: A service dog in training is any dog that is being trained to assist a
person with a disability. Other than guide dogs for the blind, there are no state-wide certifications,
standards or qualifications for service dogs in training or their trainers. Thus, a service dog trainer
may be the disabled owner of the dog or a licensed dog trainer.
342.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to provide services and access to persons with
service animals in the same manner as those without service animals. Department members shall
protect the rights of persons assisted by service animals in accordance with state and federal law.
342.3 IDENTIFICATION AND USE OF SERVICE ANIMALS
Some service animals may be readily identifiable. However, many do not have a distinctive
symbol, harness or collar.
Service animals may be used in a number of ways to provide assistance, including:
• Guiding people who are blind or have low vision.
• Alerting people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
• Retrieving or picking up items, opening doors or flipping switches for people who have
limited use of their hands, arms or legs.
• Pulling wheelchairs.
• Providing physical support and assisting with stability and balance.

Service Animals
• Doing work or performing tasks for persons with traumatic brain injury, intellectual
disabilities or psychiatric disabilities, such as reminding a person with depression to
take medication.
• Alerting a person with anxiety to the onset of panic attacks, providing tactile
stimulation to calm a person with post-traumatic stress disorder, assisting people with
schizophrenia to distinguish between hallucinations and reality, and helping people
with traumatic brain injury to locate misplaced items or follow daily routines.
342.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
Service animals that are assisting individuals with disabilities are generally permitted in all public
facilities and areas where the general public is allowed. Department members are expected to
treat individuals with service animals with the same courtesy and respect that the Berkeley Police
Department affords to all members of the public (28 CFR 35.136).
342.4.1 INQUIRY
If it is apparent or if a member is aware that an animal is a service animal, the individual generally
should not be asked any questions as to the status of the animal. If it is unclear whether an animal
meets the definition of a service animal, the member should ask the individual only the following
questions (28 CFR 35.136(f)):
• Is the animal required because of a disability?
• What task or service has the service animal been trained to perform?
If the individual explains that the animal is required because of a disability and has been trained to
work or perform at least one task, the animal meets the definition of a service animal and no further
questions as to the animal’s status should be asked. The individual should not be questioned
about his/her disability nor should the person be asked to provide any license, certification or
identification card for the service animal.
342.4.2 ANIMALS IN TRAINING
A service animal in training that is not a dog may be denied entry into public establishments.
A service dog in training may be allowed entry into public establishments under either of the
following conditions:
(a) The individual with the disability advises they are in the process of training the dog to
become a service animal, OR
(b) The individual advises they are not disabled but are in the process of training the dog
to become a service animal and the person has some documentation to identify him
or her as a dog trainer.
342.4.3 CONTACT
Service animals are not pets. Department members should not interfere with the important work
performed by a service animal by talking to, petting or otherwise initiating contact with a service
animal.

342.4.4 REMOVAL
If a service animal is not housebroken or exhibits vicious behavior, poses a direct threat to the
health of others, or unreasonably disrupts or interferes with normal business operations, an officer
may direct the handler to remove the animal from the premises. Barking alone is not a threat nor
does a direct threat exist if the person takes prompt, effective action to control the service animal
(28 CFR 35.136(b)).
Each incident must be considered individually and past incidents alone are not cause for excluding
a service animal. Removal of a service animal may not be used as a reason to refuse service to
an individual with disabilities. Members of this department are expected to provide all services as
are reasonably available to an individual with a disability, with or without a service animal.
342.4.5 COMPLAINTS
When handling calls of a complaint regarding a service animal, members of this department should
remain neutral and should be prepared to explain the legal requirements concerning service
animals to the concerned parties. Businesses are required to allow service animals to accompany
their handlers into the same areas that other customers or members of the public are allowed
(28 CFR 36.302).
Absent a violation of law independent of disability laws, officers should take no enforcement action
beyond keeping the peace. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against as a
result of a disability should be referred to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(DOJ).

Off-Duty Law Enforcement Actions
344.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The decision to become involved in a law enforcement action when off-duty can place an officer
as well as others at great risk and must be done with careful consideration. This policy is intended
to provide guidelines for officers of the Berkeley Police Department with respect to taking law
enforcement action while off-duty.
344.2 POLICY
Initiating law enforcement action while off-duty is generally discouraged. Officers should not
attempt to initiate enforcement action when witnessing minor crimes, such as suspected
intoxicated drivers, reckless driving or minor property crimes. Such incidents should be promptly
reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
Officers are not expected to place themselves in unreasonable peril. However, any sworn member
of this department who becomes aware of an incident or circumstance that he/she reasonably
believes poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death, or significant property damage
may take reasonable action to minimize the threat.
When public safety or the prevention of major property damage requires immediate action, officers
should first consider reporting and monitoring the activity and only take direct action as a last
resort.
344.3 FIREARMS
Officers of this department may carry firearms while off-duty in accordance with federal regulations
and department policy. All firearms and ammunition must meet guidelines as described in the
department Firearms Policy. When carrying firearms while off-duty officers shall also carry their
department-issued badge or an authorized flat badge and identification.
Firearms shall not be carried by any officer who has consumed an amount of an alcoholic beverage
or taken any drugs or medications or any combination thereof that could adversely affect the
officer’s senses or judgment.
344.4 DECISION TO INTERVENE
There is no legal requirement for off-duty officers to take law enforcement action. However, should
officers decide to intervene, they must evaluate whether the action is necessary or desirable, and
should take into consideration the following:
(a) The tactical disadvantage of being alone and the fact there may be multiple or hidden
suspects.
(b) The inability to communicate with responding units.
(c) The lack of equipment, such as handcuffs, OC or baton.
(d) The lack of cover.

Law Enforcement Manual
Off-Duty Law Enforcement Actions
(e) The potential for increased risk to bystanders if the off-duty officer were to intervene.
(f) Unfamiliarity with the surroundings.
(g) The potential for the off-duty officer to be misidentified by other peace officers or
members of the public.
Officers should consider waiting for on-duty uniformed officers to arrive, and gather as much
accurate intelligence as possible instead of immediately intervening.
344.4.1 INTERVENTION PROCEDURE
If involvement is reasonably necessary the officer should attempt to call or have someone else
call 9-1-1 to request immediate assistance. The dispatcher should be informed that an off-duty
officer is on-scene and should be provided a description of the officer if possible.
Whenever practicable, the officer should loudly and repeatedly identify him/herself as a police
officer until acknowledged. Official identification should also be displayed.
344.4.2 INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL INTEREST
Officers should refrain from handling incidents of personal interest, (e.g., family or neighbor
disputes) and should remain neutral. In such circumstances officers should call the responsible
agency to handle the matter.
344.4.3 NON-SWORN RESPONSIBILITIES
Non-sworn personnel should not become involved in any law enforcement actions while off-duty
except to notify the local law enforcement authority and remain at the scene, if safe and practicable.
344.4.4 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
When encountering a non-uniformed officer in public, uniformed officers should wait for
acknowledgement by the non-uniformed officer in case he/she needs to maintain an undercover
capability.
344.5 REPORTING
Any off-duty officer who engages in any law enforcement activity, regardless of jurisdiction, shall
notify the Watch Commander as soon as practicable. The Watch Commander shall determine
whether a report should be filed by the employee.
Officers should cooperate fully with the agency having jurisdiction in providing statements or
reports as requested or as appropriate.

small loose objects, etc). Circumstances may indicate that exterior deployment is preferable to
deployment on the interior of a structure. Whenever possible, devices should be deployed to an
area visible to the deploying officer. A flash bang pole may also be utilized to facilitate deployment.
353.7 SAFETY EQUIPMENT
All personnel carrying flash/sound diversionary devices in an actual incident or situation shall wear
fire-retardant gloves and eye protection. The previously mentioned equipment is mandatory for
training.
Because flash/sound diversionary devices have the potential to ignite flammable materials, a
portable fire extinguisher or the Fire Department shall be readily accessible whenever devices are
carried and may be deployed.
353.8 DOCUMENTATION AND REVIEW
Whenever flash/sound diversionary devices are carried by personnel in an actual situation or
incident, that fact shall be noted in the after-action report or police report. In the event devices are
deployed, the circumstances surrounding their deployment shall be fully described.
The Chief of Police or his or her designee shall be responsible for reviewing any deployment of
flash/sound diversionary devices to ensure that policy is/was followed.
353.9 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Flash/sound diversionary devices are registered by serial number with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). Typically, the Department's purchase of new devices is reported
directly (by case-lot serial numbers) to ATF by the device manufacturer via ATF Form 5.
The National Firearms Act requires the Department to notify ATF upon the use/expenditure
of flash/sound diversionary devices. The SRT Light Sound Diversionary Device Instructor shall
be responsible for submitting written notification to ATF when devices listed have been used/
expended. Notification to ATF may be in the form of Department Letterhead with a description
of the device, serial numbers, and date used. This notification may be done quarterly to include
multiple uses, but it should be submitted for a time period not to exceed three-month span of time.
If there are no uses in a given quarter, no reporting is necessary.

The purpose of this policy is to define the patrol function and address intra-organizational
cooperation and information sharing.
400.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department provides patrol services 24 hours a day, seven days a week and
will prioritize responses to requests for emergency services using available resources to enhance
the safety of the public and department members.
400.3 INFORMATION SHARING
To the extent feasible, all information relevant to the mission of the Department should be shared
among all divisions and specialized units on a timely basis. Members should be provided with
opportunities on a regular basis to share information during the daily briefings and to attend

other units and divisions.
400.4 CROWDS, EVENTS AND GATHERINGS
Officers may encounter gatherings of people, including but not limited to, civil demonstrations,
civic, social and business events, public displays, parades and sporting events. Officers should
monitor such events as time permits in an effort to keep the peace and protect the safety and rights
of those present. A patrol supervisor should be notified when it becomes reasonably foreseeable
that such an event may require increased monitoring, contact or intervention.
Officers responding to an event or gathering that warrants law enforcement involvement should
carefully balance the speech and association rights of those present with applicable public safety
concerns before taking enforcement action.
Generally, officers should consider seeking compliance through advisements and warnings for
minor violations and should reserve greater enforcement options for more serious violations or
when voluntary compliance with the law is not achieved.
Officers are encouraged to contact organizers or responsible persons to seek voluntary
compliance that may address relevant public safety/order concerns.
Officers should consider enforcement of applicable state and local laws, such as Penal Code §
602.1 (obstructing or intimidating business operators), when the activity blocks the entrance or
egress of a facility or location and when voluntary compliance with the law is not achieved.

Fair and Impartial Policing
401.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy is intended to reaffirm the commitment of the Berkeley Police Department to fair and
impartial policing; to clarify the circumstances in which dispatchers and officers can consider race,
ethnicity and other demographics; and to reinforce procedures that serve to assure the public that
we are providing service and enforcing laws in an equitable way, including identifying, intercepting,
and documenting profiling by proxy.
California Penal Code Section 13519.4(e) prohibits racial profiling by law enforcement officers.
This policy explicitly prohibits racial profiling and other biased policing. This policy describes the
limited circumstances in which members can consider race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age,
religion, sexual orientation/identity or socio-economic status in making law enforcement decisions.
401.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Bias-based policing - Any police-initiated action that relies on the race, ethnicity or national origin
rather than the behavior of an individual or information that leads the police to a particular individual
who has been identified as being engaged in criminal activity.
401.2 POLICY
Investigative detentions, traffic stops, arrests, searches and property seizures by officers will be
based on a standard of reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Officers must be able to articulate
specific facts and circumstances that support reasonable suspicion or probable cause.
Officers shall not consider race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation/
identity or socio-economic status in establishing either reasonable suspicion or probable cause,
or when carrying out other law enforcement activities except when officers are:
(a) Seeking specific person(s) who have been described in part by any of the above listed
characteristics, or
(b) The person(s) are being sought for a specific law enforcement purpose.
Discrimination or harassment based on a trait or class described above is considered a “serious
allegation” of misconduct.
401.3 RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION
Employees who become aware of another employee engaging in biased policing shall adhere to
reporting procedures set forth in the Personnel Complaints Policy.
A supervisor or command officer who becomes aware of biased policing shall adhere to notification
and administrative procedures set forth in the Personnel Complaints Policy.
All reports of biased policing shall be investigated in accordance with the Personnel Complaints
Policy.

Fair and Impartial Policing
401.4 PROFILING BY PROXY
Bias, racism or profiling by proxy occurs in a call for service when an individual call the police and
makes false or ill-informed claims about persons they dislike or are biased against. Dispatchers
and Officers have a role in mitigating bias-based calls for service (CFS), and proper handling of
these calls is important to maintain and build trust between the police and the community.
Call takers have a responsibility to do an initial screen and triage of all calls to ensure they are
accurately entered as the correct CFS with the appropriate priority attached. Call takers should
ask questions and explore whether there are concrete, observable behaviors that form the basis
of the suspicious activity or crime the RP is reporting. Calls for service (CFS) should focus on
behaviors of involved parties, not appearance. Reports of suspicious activity require the reporting
party (RP) to articulate something criminal or reasonably suspicious about a person's behavior.
If a Call Taker believes an RP is making a bias-based call for service, they should:
1. Create a call for service,
2. Enter the details provided by the RP in the call narrative
3. In the Nature of Call field enter: "Supervisor review required" which will ensure that
the call is not ready for dispatch, and
4. Notify the on duty supervisor. Supervisor will review the merits of the call for service
and either approve for dispatching or notify a Watch Commander (or designee)
5. Watch Commander will determine if a response will be provided and/or follow-up up
with the RP for more information.
401.5 REPORTING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
The Chief of Police or the authorized designee shall ensure that all data required by the California
Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding complaints of racial bias against officers is collected and
reported annually to the DOJ (Penal Code § 13012; Penal Code § 13020).
401.5.1 DEMOGRAPHIC DATA PROCEDURES
All sworn officers shall provide demographic statistical data once for each individual as listed
below:
(a) All vehicle and bicycle detentions.
(b) All pedestrian detentions
(c) Anytime anyone is detained, regardless of the cause
(d) Anytime anyone is searched regardless of the cause.
Officers shall provide demographic statistical data pursuant to the requirements of the RIPA
statute, AB 953.

401.6 ADMINISTRATION
Each year, the Operations Division Captain shall review the efforts of the Department to prevent
racial or biased based profiling and submit an overview, including public concerns and complaints,
to the Chief of Police.
The annual report should not contain any identifying information about any specific complaint,
member of the public or officers. It should be reviewed by the Chief of Police to identify any
changes in training or operations that should be made to improve service.
Supervisors should review the annual report and discuss the results with those they are assigned
to supervise.
401.7 TRAINING
Training on racial or bias-based profiling and review of this policy should be conducted as directed
by the Personnel and Training Bureau.
(a) All sworn members of this department will be scheduled to attend Peace Officer
Standards and Training (POST)-approved training on the subject of racial or bias-
based profiling.
(b) Pending participation in such POST-approved training and at all times, all members

Law Enforcement Manual
Crime and Disaster Scene Integrity
to be treated, those exigent circumstances will likely no longer exist. Officers should thereafter
secure the scene and conduct no further search until additional or alternate authority for the search
is obtained, such as consent or a search warrant.
403.5.1 CONSENT
When possible, officers should seek written consent to search from authorized individuals.
However, in the case of serious crimes or major investigations, it may be prudent to also obtain
a search warrant. Consent as an additional authorization may be sought, even in cases where a
search warrant has been granted.
403.6 EXECUTION OF HEALTH ORDERS
Any sworn member of this department is authorized to enforce all orders of the local health officer
that have been issued for the purpose of preventing the spread of any contagious, infectious or
communicable disease (Health and Safety Code § 120155).
403.7 ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE STEPS
Once the scene is stabilized, the handling officer or the on-scene supervisor should begin
requesting additional resources. The following list generally describes requests that may or may
not fit the need for investigating the incident properly. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive,
is not necessarily in order and may be altered according to the demands of each situation.
(a) Request detectives to the scene
(b) Make proper notifications, PIO, DCO etc.(see Major Incidents policy)
(c) Photographs (See Digital Evidence policy)
(d) Request an Identification Technician to the scene for photographs and evidence
collection.

Crime and Disaster Scene Integrity
To ensure their safety, officers shall remain on scene with the ID Tech until the ID Tech’s work is
completed or until they advise the officer that he/she is free to leave.
403.8.1 EVIDENCE COLLECTION
Most evidence can be collected at the scene by the handling or an assisting officer. However on
large scale investigations, an ID Tech may be requested to collect evidence from the scene. In
general, certain evidence should only be collected by the ID Technician. These items may include:
1. Blood stained objects or dried physiological materials shall be air-dried in a protected
environment, individually packaged into paper bags or bundles, and appropriately
marked for identification.
2. Physiological materials such as human tissue may be collected as evidence and
require specific unique handling to preserve its evidentiary value. In such cases,
officers should contact the Identification Technician or the Homicide Detail or, if after
hours, the on-call homicide investigator for details on proper handling.
3. Physical evidence, such as liquid blood samples, must be placed in proper containers
and delivered promptly to the laboratory, or placed in the Property Room refrigerator.
4. Other items possibly supporting latent prints and/or trace evidence must be protected
from any movement or action that might destroy or contaminate the viability of this
evidence
It should be noted that non-sworn personnel, including ID Techs are not trained in drug/narcotic
testing and shall refer/surrender any drugs/narcotics to the handling officer for proper handling
and booking (see Property and Evidence policy).
403.9 CHAIN OF CUSTODY
The chain of custody is the written record of all individuals who have maintained control of
evidence. The chain of custody begins when an item of evidence is collected and is maintained
until the final disposition is made. The chain of custody assures continual accountability. Each
individual in the chain is responsible for evidence while under his/her control.
The chain of custody shall be documented on the outside of most evidence packaging but should
also be documented in the associated case report (see also the Property and Evidence policy).
403.10 CRIME SCENE SKETCHES
If the decision is made for a crime scene sketch, the officer preparing the sketch should make
sure that the sketch includes, at minimum:
(a) An arrow or indicator of the direction of north.
(b) Geographical location, such as a street address or an intersection of streets.
(c) An indicator of the type of room if the sketch is inside a building, ie., living room,
bedroom, etc.

Special Response Team
404.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Special Response Team (SRT) is comprised of six elements: Command, Negotiator, Tactical,
Tactical Dispatch, Logistics and TEMS. The Team has been established to provide specialized
support in handling critical field operations where intense negotiations and/or special tactical
deployment methods beyond the capacity of field officers appear to be necessary. This policy
is written to comply with the guidelines established in the Attorney General's Commission on
Special Weapons and Tactics Report (September 2002) and the POST 2005 SWAT Operational
Guidelines and Standardized Training Recommendations (Penal Code § 13514.1).
404.1.1 OPERATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY
The Policy Manual sections pertaining to the Crisis Response Unit are divided into Administrative
and Operational Policy and Procedures. Since situations that necessitate the need for such a
police response vary greatly from incident to incident and such events often demand on-the-
scene evaluation, the Operational Policy outlined in this manual section serves as a guideline
to department personnel allowing for appropriate on scene decision making as required. The
Administrative Procedures, however, are more restrictive and few exceptions should be taken.
404.1.2 SPECIAL RESPONSE TEAM DEFINED
A Special Response Team team is a designated unit of law enforcement officers that is specifically
trained and equipped to work as a coordinated team to resolve critical incidents that are so
hazardous, complex, or unusual that they may exceed the capabilities of first responders or
investigative units including, but not limited to, hostage taking, barricaded suspects, snipers,
terrorist acts and other high-risk incidents. As a matter of department policy, such a unit may also
be used to serve high-risk warrants, both search and arrest, where public and officer safety issues
warrant the use of such a unit.
404.2 POLICY
It shall be the policy of this department to maintain a Special Response Team and to provide the
equipment, personnel, and training necessary to maintain a SWAT team. The SWAT team should
develop sufficient resources to perform three basic operational functions:
(a) Command and Control
(b) Containment
(c) Entry/Apprehension/Rescue
It is understood it is difficult to categorize specific capabilities for critical incidents. Training
needs may vary based on the experience level of the team personnel, and potential incident
commanders. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit individual teams from responding to a situation
that exceeds their training levels due to the exigency of the circumstances. The preservation of
innocent human life is paramount.

Hazardous Material Response
406.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Hazardous materials present a potential harm to employees resulting from their exposure. To
comply with Title 8, California Code of Regulations, § 5194, the following is to be the policy of
this department.
406.1.1 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL DEFINED
A hazardous material is a substance which by its nature, containment and reactivity, has the
capability of inflicting harm during exposure; characterized as being toxic, corrosive, flammable,
reactive, an irritant or strong sensitizer and thereby posing a threat to health when improperly
managed.
406.2 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONSE
Employees may encounter situations involving suspected hazardous materials, such as at the
scene of a traffic accident, chemical spill or fire. When employees come into contact with a
suspected hazardous material, certain steps should be taken to protect themselves and citizens.
The following steps should be considered at any scene involving suspected hazardous materials:
(a) Attempt to identify the type of hazardous substance. (Identification can be determined
by placard, driver’s manifest or statements from the person transporting).
(b) Notify the Fire Department.
(c) Provide first-aid for injured parties if it can be done safely and without contamination.
(d) Begin evacuation of the immediate area and surrounding areas, depending on the
substance. Voluntary evacuation should be considered; however, depending on the
substance, mandatory evacuation may be necessary.
(e) Notify the local health authority. Such notification is mandatory when a spilled or
released item is a pesticide (Health and Safety Code § 105215).
(f) Notify the Department of Toxic Substances Control. This is mandatory when an
officer comes in contact with, or is aware of, the presence of a suspected hazardous
substance at a site where an illegal controlled substance is or was manufactured
(Health and Safety § 25354.5).
406.3 REPORTING EXPOSURE(S)
Department personnel who believe that they have been exposed to a hazardous material shall
immediately report the exposure to a supervisor. Each exposure shall be documented by the
employee in accordance with the On-Duty Injuries policy.
Injury or illness caused or believed to be caused from exposure to hazardous materials shall be
reported the same as any other on-duty injury or illness in addition to a crime report or incident
report.

Law Enforcement Manual
Response to Hostage and Barricade Incidents
407.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for situations where officers have legal cause
to contact, detain or arrest a person, and the person refuses to submit to the lawful requests of
the officers by remaining in a structure or vehicle and/or by taking a hostage.
The scope of this policy is not intended to address all variables that officers encounter during
their initial response or when a hostage or barricade situation has developed. This policy does
not require or purport to recommend specific strategies or tactics for resolution as each incident
is a dynamic and rapidly evolving event.
407.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Barricade situation - An incident where a person maintains a position of cover or concealment
and ignores or resists law enforcement personnel, and it is reasonable to believe the subject is
armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.
Hostage situation - An incident where it is reasonable to believe a person is:
(a) Unlawfully held by a hostage-taker as security so that specified terms or conditions
will be met.
(b) Unlawfully held against his/her will under threat or actual use of force.
407.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to address hostage and barricade situations with
due regard for the preservation of life and balancing the risk of injury, while obtaining the safe
release of hostages, apprehending offenders and securing available evidence.
407.3 COMMUNICATION
When circumstances permit, initial responding officers should try to establish and maintain lines
of communication with a barricaded person or hostage-taker. Officers should attempt to identify
any additional subjects, inquire about victims and injuries, seek the release of hostages, gather
intelligence information, identify time-sensitive demands or conditions and obtain the suspect's
surrender.
When available, department-authorized negotiators should respond to the scene as soon as
practicable and assume communication responsibilities. Negotiators are permitted to exercise
flexibility in each situation based upon their training, the circumstances presented, suspect actions
or demands and the available resources.
407.3.1 EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS
Only an officer who has been designated by the District Attorney or Attorney General may use
or authorize the use of an electronic amplifying or recording device to eavesdrop on or record,
Response to Hostage and Barricade Incidents

Law Enforcement Manual
Response to Hostage and Barricade Incidents
or both, oral communication in response to an emergency situation involving a hostage or the
barricading of a location, and only when (Penal Code § 633.8(b)):
(a) The officer reasonably determines an emergency situation exists that involves the
immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person within the meaning
of 18 USC § 2518(7)(a)(i),
(b) The officer reasonably determines that the emergency situation requires that
eavesdropping on oral communication occur immediately, and
(c) There are grounds upon which an order could be obtained pursuant to 18 USC §
2516(2).
(d) An application for an order approving the eavesdropping and complying with the
requirements of Penal Code § 629.50 is made within 48 hours of the beginning of the
eavesdropping.
(e) The contents of any oral communications overheard are recorded on tape or other
comparable device.
407.4 FIRST RESPONDER CONSIDERATIONS
First responding officers should promptly and carefully evaluate all available information to
determine whether an incident involves, or may later develop into, a hostage or barricade situation.
The first responding officer should immediately request a supervisor’s response as soon as it is
determined that a hostage or barricade situation exists. The first responding officer shall assume
the duties of the supervisor until relieved by a supervisor or a more qualified responder. The officer
shall continually evaluate the situation, including the level of risk to officers, to the persons involved
and to bystanders, and the resources currently available.
The handling officer should brief the arriving supervisor of the incident, including information about
suspects and victims, the extent of any injuries, additional resources or equipment that may be
needed, and current perimeters and evacuation areas.
407.4.1 BARRICADE SITUATION
Unless circumstances require otherwise, officers handling a barricade situation should attempt to
avoid a forceful confrontation in favor of stabilizing the incident by establishing and maintaining
lines of communication while awaiting the arrival of specialized personnel and trained negotiators.
During the interim the following options, while not all-inclusive or in any particular order, should
be considered:
(a) Ensure injured persons are evacuated from the immediate threat area if it is reasonably
safe to do so. Request medical assistance.
(b) Assign personnel to a contact team to control the subject should he/she attempt to
exit the building, structure or vehicle, and attack, use deadly force, attempt to escape
or surrender prior to additional resources arriving.

Department, such as command officers and the Public Information Officer (PIO).
(j) If necessary and available, establish a tactical or exclusive radio frequency for the
incident.
(k) Establish a command post.
407.4.2 HOSTAGE SITUATION
Officers presented with a hostage situation should attempt to avoid a forceful confrontation in
favor of controlling the incident in anticipation of the arrival of specialized personnel and trained
hostage negotiators. However, it is understood that hostage situations are dynamic and can
require that officers react quickly to developing or changing threats. The following options, while
not all-inclusive or in any particular order, should be considered:
(a) Ensure injured persons are evacuated from the immediate threat area if it is reasonably
safe to do so. Request medical assistance.
(b) Assign personnel to a contact team to control the subject should he/she attempt to
exit the building, structure or vehicle, and attack, use deadly force, attempt to escape
or surrender prior to additional resources arriving.
(c) Establish a react team in the event it becomes necessary to rapidly enter a building,
structure or vehicle, such as when the suspect is using deadly force against any
hostages (see the Rapid Response and Deployment Policy, 413).
(d) Assist hostages or potential hostages to escape if it is reasonably safe to do so.
Hostages should be kept separated if practicable pending further interview.
(e) Request additional personnel, resources and equipment as needed.
(f) Provide responding emergency personnel with a safe arrival route to the location.
(g) Evacuate uninjured persons in the immediate threat area if it is reasonably safe to
do so.

perimeter as appropriate. Check for injuries, the presence of other involved subjects,
witnesses, evidence or additional information.
(l) Determine the need for and notify the appropriate persons within and outside the
Department, such as command officers and the PIO.
(m) If necessary and available, establish a tactical or exclusive radio frequency for the
incident.
407.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon being notified that a hostage or barricade situation exists, the supervisor should immediately
respond to the scene, assess the risk level of the situation, establish a proper chain of command
and assume the role of Incident Commander until properly relieved. This includes requesting a
Special Response Team (SRT) response if appropriate and apprising the SRT Commander of the
circumstances. In addition, the following options should be considered:
(a) Ensure injured persons are evacuated and treated by medical personnel.
(b) Ensure the completion of necessary first responder responsibilities or assignments.
(c) Request crisis negotiators, specialized units, additional personnel, resources or
equipment as appropriate.

of the incident.
(f) If it is practicable to do so, arrange for video documentation of the operation.
(g) Consider contacting utility and communication providers to restrict such services (e.g.,
restricting electric power, gas, telephone service).
1. When considering restricting communication services, a supervisor should make
the determination that there is reason to believe an emergency situation exists
involving immediate danger of death or great bodily harm and that an interruption
to communication services is necessary to protect public safety (Penal Code §
11471). The supervisor must ensure the Department obtains a court order, in
accordance with Penal Code § 11472, prior to requesting the interruption. In the
case of an extreme emergency when there is insufficient time to obtain an order
prior to the request, application for the order must be submitted within six hours
after initiating the interruption.

i. If six hours is not possible, then the application for the court order shall
be made at the first reasonably available opportunity, but no later than 24
hours in accordance with Penal Code § 11475.
(h) Ensure adequate law enforcement coverage for the remainder of the City during the
incident. The supervisor should direct non-essential personnel away from the scene
unless they have been summoned by the supervisor or the Communications Center.

(k) Debrief personnel and review documentation as appropriate.
407.6 SPECIAL RESPONSE TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES
The Incident Commander will decide, with input from the SRT Commander and approval from the
Chief of Police or his/her designee, whether to deploy SRT during a hostage or barricade situation.
Once the Incident Commander authorizes deployment, the SRT Commander or the authorized
designee will be responsible for the tactical portion of the operation and will coordinate the transfer
of the operation from Operations personnel to SRT personnel.
If two SRT Commanders are on scene, one shall assume Tactical Command and the other shall
assume Incident Command of the hostage or barricade situation.
407.7 ACTIVATION OF ON-DUTY OPERATIONS SRT PERSONNEL
On-duty SRT members assigned to uniformed patrol duty, not otherwise involved in an
assignment, will respond to the scene of the incident and support the operation. Notice of this
response will be made to the Communication Center by the responding SRT officer as soon as
possible.
407.8 ACTIVATION OF ON-DUTY NON-OPERATIONS SRT PERSONNEL
Upon request of the Incident Commander, available on-duty SRT members in assignments other
than uniformed patrol duty will respond and support the operation. The Communication Center
shall be responsible for notifying on-duty SRT personnel of the incident.
407.9 USE OF FIREARMS
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Use of Force Policy, and with the prior approval of SRT
Command, officers may discharge firearms to shoot out lights or effect some other physical action
against an inanimate object when it reasonably appears that such discharge can be performed
safely and that it will result in a significant advantage in bringing a critical incident to a successful
resolution.

Law Enforcement Manual
Crisis Intervention
409.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for utilizing the Department's Crisis Intervention Team and
interacting with those who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis. Interaction
with such individuals has the potential for miscommunication and violence. It often requires an
officer to evaluate a person’s mental state and intent in order to effectively and legally interact
with the individual.
409.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Mental Health Consumer - A description commonly used within the mental health community
when referring to an individual diagnosed with a mental illness, who is involved in a mental health
crisis, and/or utilizes mental health services.
Mobile Crisis Team - The Mobile Crisis Team (MCT) is a mobile emergency mental health
service staffed by licensed mental health professionals and interns. The MCT offers crisis
intervention, counseling follow-up and consultation services. The MCT work collaboratively with
police personnel, including CIT officers, and act as professional adjuncts. MCT clinicians may be
used by CIT officers as consultants regarding crisis intervention. The MCT may also generate
referrals for mental health consumers and disposition recommendations for CIT officers.
Person in Crisis- A person whose level of distress or mental health symptoms have exceeded
the person's internal ability to manage his/her behavior or emotions. A crisis can be precipitated by
any number of things, including an increase in the symptoms of mental illness despite treatment
compliance; non-compliance with treatment, including a failure to take prescribed medications
appropriately; or any other circumstance or event that causes the person to engage in erratic,
disruptive or dangerous behavior that may be accompanied by impaired judgment.
409.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to providing a consistently high level of service to
all members of the community and recognizes that persons in crisis may benefit from intervention.
The Department will collaborate, where feasible, with mental health professionals to develop an
overall intervention strategy to guide its members’ interactions with those experiencing a mental
health crisis. This is to ensure equitable and safe treatment of all involved.
409.3 SIGNS
Members should be alert to any of the following possible signs of mental health issues or crises:
(a) A known history of mental illness
(b) Threats of or attempted suicide
(c) Loss of memory
(d) Incoherence, disorientation or slow response

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Crisis Intervention
(e) Delusions, hallucinations, perceptions unrelated to reality or grandiose ideas
(f) Depression, pronounced feelings of hopelessness or uselessness, extreme sadness
or guilt
(g) Social withdrawal
(h) Manic or impulsive behavior, extreme agitation, lack of control
(i) Lack of fear
(j) Anxiety, aggression, rigidity, inflexibility or paranoia
Members should be aware that this list is not exhaustive. The presence or absence of any of these
should not be treated as proof of the presence or absence of a mental health issue or crisis.
409.4 COORDINATION WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS
The Personnel and Training Officer will collaborate with mental health professionals to develop
an education and response protocol. It should include a list of community resources, to guide
department interaction with those who may be suffering from mental illness or who appear to be
in a mental health crisis.
409.5 FIRST RESPONDERS
Safety is a priority for first responders. It is important to recognize that individuals under the
influence of alcohol, drugs or both may exhibit symptoms that are similar to those of a person in a
mental health crisis. These individuals may still present a serious threat to officers; such a threat
should be addressed with reasonable tactics. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to limit an
officer's authority to use reasonable force when interacting with a person in crisis.
Officers are reminded that mental health issues, mental health crises and unusual behavior alone
are not criminal offenses. Individuals may benefit from treatment as opposed to incarceration.
An officer responding to a call involving a person in crisis should:
(a) Promptly assess the situation independent of reported information and make a
preliminary determination regarding whether a mental health crisis may be a factor.
(b) Request available cover officers and specialized resources, such as the Mobile Crisis
Team and/or a CIT member (if available), as deemed necessary and, if it is reasonably
believed that the person is in a crisis situation, use conflict resolution and de-escalation
techniques to stabilize the incident if possible.
(c) If feasible, and without compromising safety, turn off flashing lights, bright lights or
sirens.
(d) Attempt to determine if weapons are present or available.
1. Prior to making contact, and whenever possible and reasonable, conduct a
search of the Department of Justice Automated Firearms System via the
California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) to determine
whether the person is the registered owner of a firearm (Penal Code § 11106.4).
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Crisis Intervention - 338

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Crisis Intervention
(e) Take into account the person's mental and emotional state and potential inability to
understand commands or to appreciate the consequences of his/her action or inaction,
as perceived by the officer.
(f) Secure the scene and clear the immediate area as necessary.
(g) If feasible, employ tactics, such as time, distance and cover, to preserve the safety
of all involved parties.
(h) Determine if a crime(s) has been committed and what course of action should be
followed based on the circumstances presented.
(i) Request a supervisor, as warranted.
(j) Evaluate any available information that might assist in determining cause or motivation
for the person's actions or stated intentions.
(k) If circumstances reasonably permit, consider and employ alternatives to force.
409.6 DE-ESCALATION
Officers should consider that taking no action or passively monitoring the situation may be the
most reasonable response to a mental health crisis.
Once it is determined that a situation is a mental health crisis and immediate safety concerns
have been addressed, responding members should be aware of the following considerations and
should generally:
• Evaluate safety conditions.
• Introduce themselves and attempt to obtain the person's name.
• Be patient, polite, calm, courteous and avoid overreacting.
• Speak and move slowly and in a non-threatening manner.
• Moderate the level of direct eye contact.
• Remove distractions or disruptive people from the area, if possible.
• Demonstrate active listening skills (e.g., summarize the person's verbal
communication).
• Provide for sufficient avenues of retreat or escape should the situation become volatile.
Responding officers generally should not:
• Use stances or tactics that can be interpreted as aggressive.
• Allow others to interrupt or engage the person.
• Corner a person who is not believed to be armed, violent or suicidal.
• Argue, speak with a raised voice or use threats to obtain compliance.

409.7 INCIDENT ORIENTATION
When responding to an incident that may involve mental illness or a mental health crisis, the
officer should request that the dispatcher provide critical information as it becomes available. This
includes:
(a) Whether the person relies on drugs or medication, or may have failed to take his/her
medication.
(b) Whether there have been prior incidents, suicide threats/attempts, and whether there
has been previous police response.
(c) Contact information for a treating physician or mental health professional.
(d) Whether there are guns registered to the person.
(e) What, if any, vehicles are registered to the person.
(f) Information regarding additional persons at the location of the incident.
Additional resources and a supervisor should be requested as warranted.
409.8 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon request, a supervisor should respond to the scene of interactions with those in crisis.
Responding supervisors should:
(a) Attempt to secure appropriate and sufficient resources such as additional officers, the
Mobile Crisis Team and/or a CIT member.
(b) Closely monitor any use of force, including the use of restraints, and ensure that those
subjected to the use of force are provided with timely access to medical care (see the
Handcuffing and Restraints Policy).
(c) Consider strategic disengagement. Absent an imminent threat to the public and,
as circumstances dictate, this may include removing or reducing law enforcement
resources or engaging in passive monitoring.
(d) Ensure that all reports are completed and that incident documentation uses
appropriate terminology and language.
409.9 INCIDENT REPORTING
Members engaging in any oral or written communication associated with a mental health crisis
should be mindful of the sensitive nature of such communications and shall exercise appropriate
discretion when referring to or describing persons and circumstances.
Members having contact with a person in crisis shall keep related information confidential,
except to the extent that revealing information is necessary to conform to department reporting
procedures or other official mental health or medical proceedings.
409.9.1 DIVERSION
Individuals who are not being arrested should be processed in accordance with the Mental Illness
Commitments Policy.

409.10 NON-SWORN INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE IN CRISIS
Non-sworn members may be required to interact with persons in crisis in an administrative
capacity, such as dispatching, fingerprinting, jail booking procedures, releasing property and
responding to records requests.
(a) Members should treat all individuals equally and with dignity and respect.
(b) If a member believes that he/she is interacting with a person in crisis, he/she should
proceed patiently and in a calm manner.
(c) Members should be aware and understand that the person may make unusual or
bizarre claims or requests.
If a person's behavior makes the Professional Staff feel unsafe, if the person is or becomes
disruptive or violent, or if the person acts in such a manner as to cause the Professional Staff
to believe that the person may be harmful to him/herself or others, an officer should be promptly
summoned to provide assistance.
409.11 EVALUATION
The Department's Crime Analyst should ensure an annual report documenting the number of
mental health related calls for service is completed and submitted to the Chief of Police through
the chain of command.
409.12 TRAINING
In coordination with the mental health community and appropriate stakeholders, the Department
will develop and provide comprehensive education and training to all department members
toassist themin effectively interacting with persons in crisis.
The Berkeley Police Departmentwill strive to provided available Peace Officer Standards and

410.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for when officers may take a person into custody for psychiatric
evaluation and treatment (5150 commitment) (Welfare and Institutions Code § 5150).
410.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to protect the public and individuals through the
legal and appropriate use of the 72-hour treatment and evaluation commitment process (5150
commitment).
410.3 AUTHORITY
An officer having probable cause may take a person into custody and place the person in an
approved mental health facility for a 72-hour treatment and evaluation when the officer believes
that, as a result of a mental disorder, the person is a danger to him/herself or others or the person is
gravely disabled (Welfare and Institutions Code § 5150; Welfare and Institutions Code § 5585.50).
When determining whether to take a person into custody, officers are not limited to only
determining if the person is an imminent danger and shall consider reasonably available
information about the historical course of the person’s mental disorder, which may include
evidence presented from any of the following (Welfare and Institutions Code § 5150; Welfare and
Institutions Code § 5150.05):
(a) The person who is being evaluated or anyone designated by the person
(b) An individual who is providing or has provided mental health treatment or related
support services to the person
(c) A family member
410.4 CONSIDERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Any officer handling a call involving an individual who may qualify for a 5150 commitment should

(a) Available information that might assist in determining the cause and nature of the
person’s action or stated intentions.
(b) Conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques.
(c) Community or other resources available to assist in dealing with mental health issues.
While these steps are encouraged, nothing in this section is intended to dissuade officers from
taking reasonable action to ensure the safety of the officers and others.
Officers should consider a 5150 commitment over arrest when mental health issues appear to
be a mitigating factor for people who are suspected of committing minor crimes or creating other
public safety issues.

When a person is taken into custody for evaluation, or within a reasonable time thereafter,
and unless a responsible relative, guardian or conservator is in possession of the person's
personal property, the officer shall take reasonable precautions to safeguard the individual’s
personal property in his/her possession or on the premises occupied by the person (Welfare and
Institutions Code § 5150). The officer shall document the disposition of the person's property on
the application.
410.5 SEARCH PRIOR TO TRANSPORTATION
Prior to transportation, the officer taking a mentally disordered person into custody pursuant to
W&I 5150, or who facilitates the person's request for voluntary psychiatric evaluation, shall ensure
the person is searched for weapons or items that could present a safety hazard or security concern
to ambulance personnel.
410.6 TRANSPORTATION
Persons wishing to self-commit or who are being detained pursuant to W&I 5150 shall be
transported to an appropriate care facility via ambulance.
Communication Center personnel shall be responsible for requesting the appropriate ambulance
service, based on information communicated by the requesting officer and requirements set forth

5150 transportation.
Persons requiring medical clearance prior to delivery to a psychiatric care facility shall be
transported to the appropriate receiving hospital as determined by ambulance personnel.
Officers shall evaluate the mentally disordered person’s potential for violence when considering
transportation logistics.
Operations Division personnel shall be responsible for post-commitment transportation of a person
on a "POLICE HOLD" from the involved psychiatric treatment facility.

The officer shall complete an application for a 72-hour detention for evaluation and treatment,
provide it to the transporting personnel assigned to that patient and retain a copy of the application
as the case report.
The application shall include the circumstances for officer involvement; the probable cause to
believe the person is, as a result of a mental health disorder, a danger to others or him/herself or
gravely disabled; and all information used for the determination of probable cause (Welfare and
Institutions Code § 5150; Welfare and Institutions Code § 5150.05).

The officer taking a person into custody for evaluation shall advise the person of:
(a) The officer’s name and agency.
(b) The fact that the person is not under criminal arrest but is being taken for examination

rights.
(c) The name of the facility to which the person is being taken.
(d) If the person is being taken into custody at his/her residence, he/she should also be
advised that he/she may take a few personal items, which the officer must approve,
and may make a telephone call or leave a note indicating where he/she is being taken.
The officer should also ask if the person needs assistance turning off any appliance
or water.
The advisement shall be given in a language the person understands. If the person cannot
understand an oral advisement, the information shall be provided in writing (Welfare and
Institutions Code § 5150).
410.8 VOLUNTARY EVALUATIONS
410.8.1 VOLUNTARY EVALUATIONS - NOT MEETING THE W&I 5150 CRITERIA
When an officer encounters an individual who desires to be voluntarily evaluated for a W&I 5150
commitment but, in the officer's opinion, doesn't meet the criteria for a hold, the officer should:
(a) Facilitate the transport of the person to an appropriate facility that is able to conduct
an evaluation.
(b) Document the circumstances surrounding the individual's desire to pursue a voluntary
evaluation in an MDT or Incident Report.
If at any point the person changes his/her mind regarding the voluntary evaluation, the person
shall be allowed to decline transport.
410.8.2 VOLUNTARY EVALUATIONS - MEETING THE W&I 5150 CRITERIA
When an officer encounters an individual who desires to be voluntarily evaluated for a W&I 5150
commitment AND, in the officer's opinion, MEETS the criteria, the officer should:
(a) Facilitate the transport of the person to an appropriate facility that is able to conduct
an evaluation.
(b) Complete a W&I 5150 application.
Completing the application safeguards for the possibility that the person may change their mind
regarding the voluntary commitment during transport and be allowed to leave, when they are
actually in need of an evaluation at a psychiatric facility.

410.9 CRIMINAL OFFENSES
410.9.1 MINOR OFFENSES
Officers investigating an individual who is suspected of committing a minor criminal offense and
who is being taken on a 5150 commitment should resolve the criminal matter by issuing a warning
or citation, or completing a report with an out of custody request for a warrant.
410.9.2 SERIOUS OFFENSES
When an individual who may qualify for a 5150 commitment has committed a serious criminal
offense that would normally result in an arrest and transfer to a jail facility, the officer should:
(a) Arrest the individual when there is probable cause to do so.
(b) Notify the appropriate supervisor of the facts supporting the arrest and the facts that
would support the 5150 commitment.
(c) Facilitate the individual's transfer to an appropriate mental health facility.

the individual is released from the psychiatric detention.
(g) Notify oncoming shifts of the future need to transport the subject once he/she is
deemed fit for incarceration (see section 410.6 a regarding transportation).
410.10 FIREARMS AND OTHER WEAPONS
Whenever a person is taken into custody for a 5150 commitment, the handling officers should
seek to determine if the person owns or has access to any firearm or other deadly weapon defined
in Welfare and Institutions Code § 8100. Officers should consider whether it is appropriate and
consistent with current search and seizure law under the circumstances to seize any such firearms
or other dangerous weapons (e.g., safekeeping, evidence, consent).
Officers are cautioned that a search warrant is needed before entering a residence or other place
to search, unless lawful, warrantless entry has already been made (e.g., exigent circumstances,
consent). A search warrant may also be needed before searching for or seizing weapons.
The handling officers shall issue a receipt describing the deadly weapon or any firearm seized,
and list any serial number or other identification that is on the firearm. Officers shall advise the
person of the procedure for the return of any firearm or other weapon that has been taken into
custody (Welfare and Institutions Code § 8102 (b)) (see Property and Evidence Policy).
410.10.1 PETITION FOR RETURN OF FIREARMS AND OTHER WEAPONS
Whenever the handling officer has cause to believe that the future return of any confiscated
weapon might endanger the person or others, the officer shall detail those facts and circumstances
in a report. The report shall be forwarded to the Detective Bureau, which shall be responsible for

Law Enforcement Manual
Mental Illness Commitments
initiating a petition to the Superior Court for a hearing in accordance with Welfare and Institutions
Code § 8102(c), to determine whether the weapon will be returned.
The petition to the Superior Court shall be initiated within 30 days of the release of the individual
from whom such weapon has been confiscated, unless the Department makes an ex parte
application to the court to extend the time to file such a petition, up to a maximum of 60 days. At
the time any such petition is initiated, the Department shall send written notice to the individual
informing him/her of the right to a hearing on the issue, that he/she has 30 days to confirm with
the court clerk any desire for a hearing and that the failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of
any confiscated weapon.
410.11 TRAINING
This department will strive to provide Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST)-approved
advanced officer training on interaction with persons with mental disabilities, 5150 commitments
and crisis intervention.

Cite and Release Policy
411.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidance on when to release adults who are arrested for a criminal
misdemeanor offense on a written notice to appear (citation) and when to hold for court or bail.
411.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to release all persons arrested on misdemeanor
or other qualifying charges on a citation with certain exceptions (Penal Code § 853.6).
If there is a reason for non-release, the Department’s mission to protect the community will be
the primary consideration when determining whether to release any individual in lieu of holding
for court or bail.
411.3 RELEASE BY CITATION
Except in cases where a reason for non-release as described below exists, adults arrested for
a misdemeanor offense, including a private person's arrest, shall be released from custody on a
citation (Penal Code § 853.6).
The citing officer shall, at the time the defendant signs the notice to appear, call attention to the
time and place for appearance and take any other steps they deem necessary to ensure that the
defendant understands their written promise to appear.
411.3.1 FIELD CITATIONS
In most cases an adult arrested for a misdemeanor offense may be released in the field on a
citation in lieu of physical arrest when booking and fingerprinting is not practicable or immediately
required provided the individual can be satisfactorily identified, there is no outstanding arrest
warrant for the individual and none of the below described disqualifying circumstances are present
(Penal Code § 853.6; Penal Code § 1270.1).
When a booking photo or fingerprints are needed for the furtherance of any investigation, the
person should be released on citation after booking instead of on a field citation.
411.3.2 RELEASE AFTER BOOKING
In some cases it may not be feasible or desirable to release a person in the field. The person
should instead be released on citation after booking at the jail.
411.4 NON-RELEASE
411.4.1 DISQUALIFYING OFFENSES
An adult arrested on any of the following disqualifying charges shall not be released on citation
and shall be transported to the appropriate detention facility or held for court or bail after booking
(Penal Code § 1270.1):

411.4.2 REASONS FOR NON-RELEASE
A person arrested for a misdemeanor shall be released on a citation unless there is a reason for
non-release. A supervisor may authorize a release on citation regardless of whether a reason for
non-release exists when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Department and does
not present an unreasonable risk to the community (e.g., release of an intoxicated or ill person
to a responsible adult).
Reasons for non-release include (Penal Code § 853.6(i)):
(a) The person arrested is so intoxicated that they could be a danger to themselves or to
others. Release may occur as soon as this condition no longer exists.

release of the person arrested.
(g) There is a reasonable likelihood that the offense or offenses would continue or resume,
or that the safety of persons or property would be imminently endangered by the
release of the person arrested.
(h) The person arrested demands to be taken before a magistrate or has refused to sign
the notice to appear.

411.6 JUVENILE CITATIONS
Completion of criminal citations for juveniles is generally not appropriate except when cited into
traffic court for any of the following:
(a) Misdemeanor traffic violations of the Vehicle Code such as 12500(a) or 14601.1(a)
(b) Violations of the Berkeley Municipal code
(c) Marijuana violations (i.e., possession, transport, sales)
All other misdemeanor violations for juveniles shall be documented with a case number and
referred to Juvenile Probation with a Notice to Appear.
411.7 REQUESTING CASE NUMBERS
Many cases involving a criminal citation release can be handled without requesting a case number.
Traffic situations and local code violations can be documented on the reverse side of the records
copy of the citation. Most Penal Code sections will require a case number to document the incident
properly in a report. This section does not preclude an officer from requesting a case number if
the offiver feels the situation should be documented more thoroughly in a case report.

412.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines to ensure that members of the Berkeley Police Department
extend appropriate privileges and immunities to foreign diplomatic and consular representatives
in accordance with international law.
412.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department respects international laws related to the special privileges
and immunities afforded foreign diplomatic and consular representatives assigned to the United
States.
All foreign diplomatic and consular representatives shall be treated with respect and courtesy,
regardless of any privileges or immunities afforded them.
412.3 CLAIMS OF IMMUNITY
If a member comes into contact with a person where law enforcement action may be warranted and
the person claims diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities, the member should, without
delay:
(a) Notify a supervisor.
(b) Advise the person that his/her claim will be investigated and he/she may be released
in accordance with the law upon confirmation of the person’s status.
(c) Request the person’s identification card, either issued by the U.S. Department of State
(DOS), Office of the Chief of Protocol, or in the case of persons accredited to the
United Nations, by the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. These are the only reliable
documents for purposes of determining privileges and immunities.
(d) Contact the DOS Diplomatic Security Command Center at 571-345-3146 or toll free
at 866-217-2089, or at another current telephone number and inform the center of the
circumstances.
(e) Verify the immunity status with DOS and follow any instructions regarding further
detention, arrest, prosecution and/or release, as indicated by the DOS representative.
This may require immediate release, even if a crime has been committed.
Identity or immunity status should not be presumed from the type of license plates displayed on a
vehicle. If there is a question as to the status or the legitimate possession of a Diplomat or Consul
license plate, a query should be run via the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System (NLETS), designating “US” as the state.

Law Enforcement Manual
Rapid Response and Deployment
413.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Violence that is committed in schools, workplaces and other locations by individuals or a group of
individuals who are determined to target and kill persons and to create mass casualties presents
a difficult situation for law enforcement. The purpose of this policy is to identify guidelines and
factors that will assist responding officers in situations that call for rapid response and deployment.
413.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department will endeavor to plan for rapid response to crisis situations, and
to coordinate response planning with other emergency services as well as with those that are
responsible for operating sites that may be the target of a critical incident.
Nothing in this policy shall preclude the use of reasonable force, deadly or otherwise, by members
of the Department in protecting themselves or others from death or serious injury.
413.3 DEFINITIONS
Active Shooter - An Active Shooter is an individual who places other persons in immediate peril
of death or great bodily injury by engaging in random or systematic shooting, typically with the
intent to commit multiple homicides. For the purpose of this order, this term will also apply to a
person who uses any deadly weapon to systematically or randomly inflict death or great bodily
injury upon other persons.
Barricaded Suspect - A barricaded suspect is an individual who is hiding or holding out in a room
or building, is known or believed to be armed with a dangerous weapon, and has displayed or
threatened violence toward other persons. The suspect may or may not be holding hostages, but
there is no indication that his or her actions are likely to result in the immediate death or great
bodily injury of innocent persons.
Mass Casualty Incident - According to the World Health Organization, a mass casualty incident
is an incident which generates more patients at one time than locally available resources can
manage using routine procedures. It requires exceptional emergency arrangements and additional
or extraordinary assistance.
On-Scene Incident Commander - The on-scene incident commander is the first officer to arrive
at the scene of an incident of an active shooter. The officer shall assume command of the situation
and coordinate the activities and operations of responding personnel consistent with the objective
of this order until relieved by a higher authority.
413.4 FIRST RESPONSE
If there is a reasonable belief that acts or threats by a suspect are placing lives in imminent danger,
first responding officers should consider reasonable options to reduce, prevent or eliminate the
threat. Officers must decide, often under a multitude of difficult and rapidly evolving circumstances,
whether to advance on the suspect, take other actions to deal with the threat or wait for additional
resources.

Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Rapid Response and Deployment
If a suspect is actively engaged in the infliction of serious bodily harm or other life-threatening
activity toward others, officers shall take immediate action, if reasonably possible, while requesting
additional assistance.
Officers should remain aware of the possibility that an incident may be part of a coordinated multi-
location attack that may require some capacity to respond to other incidents at other locations.
When deciding on a course of action officers should consider:
(a) Whether to advance on or engage a suspect who is still a possible or perceived threat
to others. Any advance or engagement should be based on information known or
received at the time.
(b) Whether to wait for additional resources or personnel. This does not preclude an
individual officer from taking immediate action.
(c) Whether individuals who are under imminent threat can be moved or evacuated with
reasonable safety.
(d) Whether the suspect can be contained or denied access to victims.
(e) Whether the officers have the ability to effectively communicate with other personnel
or resources.
(f) Whether planned tactics can be effectively deployed.
(g) The availability of rifles, shotguns, shields, breaching tools, control devices and any
other appropriate tools, and whether the deployment of these tools will provide a
tactical advantage.
In a case of a barricaded suspect with no hostages and no immediate threat to others, officers
should consider summoning and waiting for additional assistance (Special Response Team).
413.5 COMMAND RESPONSIBILITIES
As soon as practical, a supervisor or command officer shall assume the role of Incident
Commander. As additional personnel arrive on scene, the Incident Commander should consider
implementing the Incident Command System, which may include the assignment of a Tactical
Commander. Absent compelling reasons to the contrary, the Incident Commander shall ensure
the tactics described above have been initiated to contain and eliminate the immediate threat.
Secondary responsibilities of the Incident Commander may include the assignment of additional
duties normally associated with scene management. Such tasks include, but are not limited to:
(a) The establishment of an incident command post
(b) Setting up inner perimeter containment and outer perimeter control
(c) Evacuation of persons from nearby areas that could be in imminent danger
(d) Establishing staging areas and shelter locations
(e) Assigning a Press Information Officer
(f) Ensuring that post-operation reporting requirements have been addressed

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Rapid Response and Deployment
If an active shooter incident develops into a long-term hostage or barricaded suspect situation, or
results in a protracted crime scene investigation, the Department will attempt to meet our ongoing
staffing needs without outside assistance. However, as with any mass casualty incident, the on
scene supervisor or Incident Commander shall notify the Chief or Assistant Chief of Inspectors at
the Alameda County District Attorney's Office to utilize their assistance with investigation of the
incident and/or providing victim services. Contact can be made via the Alameda County Sheriff's
Office Emergency Services Dispatch. If additional staffing is required, a formal request for mutual
aid shall be made to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office.
It shall be the responsibility of the Incident Commander to organize and convene a debriefing
session as soon as possible following an active shooter incident. The debriefing will be available
to all interested law enforcement agencies in the area and will be conducted to enhance
preparedness and to increase knowledge of such incidents.
413.6 CONSIDERATIONS
When dealing with a crisis situation members should:
(a) Assess the immediate situation and take reasonable steps to maintain operative
control of the incident.
(b) Obtain, explore and analyze sources of intelligence and known information regarding
the circumstances, location and suspect involved in the incident.
(c) Attempt to attain a tactical advantage over the suspect by reducing, preventing or
eliminating any known or perceived threat.
(d) Attempt, if feasible and based upon the suspect’s actions and danger to others, a
negotiated surrender of the suspect and release of the hostages.
413.7 PLANNING
The Operations Division Captain or his/her designee should coordinate critical incident planning.
Planning efforts should consider:
(a) Identification of likely critical incident target sites, such as schools, shopping centers,
entertainment and sporting event venues.
(b) Availability of building plans and venue schematics of likely critical incident target sites.
(c) Communications interoperability with other law enforcement and emergency service
agencies.
(d) Training opportunities in critical incident target sites, including joint training with site
occupants.
(e) Evacuation routes in critical incident target sites.
(f) Patrol first-response training.
(g) Coordination of emergency medical and fire services.
(h) Equipment needs.
(i) Mutual aid agreements with other agencies.

415.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines to members of the Berkeley Police Department
relating to immigration and interacting with federal immigration officials. This policy includes
elements from the California Government Code 7284, also known as the California Values Act,
and from Berkeley City Council Resolution No. 68,131-N.S., "City of Refuge Policy Regarding
Interaction with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement".
415.1.1 DEFINITIONS
The following definitions apply to this policy (Government Code § 7284.4):
Criminal immigration violation - Any federal criminal immigration violation that penalizes a
person’s presence in, entry or reentry to, or employment in, the United States. This does not
include any offense where a judicial warrant already has been issued.
Judicial warrant - An arrest warrant for a violation of federal criminal immigration law and issued
by a federal judge or a federal magistrate judge.
415.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department that all members make personal and professional
commitments to equal enforcement of the law and equal service to the public, in compliance with
California law and Berkeley City Council policy. Confidence in this commitment will increase the
effectiveness of this department in protecting and serving the entire community and recognizing
the dignity of all persons, regardless of their national origin or immigration status.
415.3 CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS
The City of Berkeley was declared by City Council resolution to be a City of Refuge in 1971.
Subsequent City Council resolutions in 1986, 2007, and 2016 reaffirmed and built upon the original
policy. Most recently, on July 25, 2017, City Council provided city-wide policy under Resolution
68,131-N.S., which is incorporated within this policy in full below:
(a) No department, agency, commission, officer or employee of the City of Berkeley shall
use any City funds or resources to assist in the enforcement of Federal immigration
law or to gather or disseminate information status of individuals in the City of Berkeley
unless required by law.
(b) No department agency, commission, officer or employee shall deny access to any City
services or benefits to residents on the basis of their immigration status.
(c) The prohibition set forth shall include but is not limited to:
1. Assisting or cooperating, in one’s official capacity, with any Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) investigation, detention, or arrest procedures, public
or clandestine, relating to alleged violations of the civil provision of federal
immigration law, except as required by law.

2. Requesting information about, or disseminating information regarding, the
immigration status of any individual, except as required by law.
3. Including on any application, questionnaire or interview form used in relation to
benefits, services or opportunities provided by the City of Berkeley any question
regarding immigration status.
4. It is the policy of the City of Berkeley to not allow any individual or organization to
enter City facilities if their presence would disrupt city operations. Because the
City Council believes that ICE activities in city facilities would constitute a severe
disruption to the provision of city services, any request by ICE to any City officer
or employee shall be immediately forwarded to the site director/supervisor and
the Department Director for review and consultation with the City Attorney to
ensure the safety of City employees and residents accessing city services and
compliance with applicable state and federal laws.
5. Except in limited circumstances where ICE agents have a valid judicial warrant,
after review and consultation with the Department Director and City Attorney,
City departments, agencies, commissions, officers or employees are not
required to:
• Cooperate with ICE agents
• Answer ICE agents’ questions
• Comply with an ICE Administrative Warrant
• Immediately comply with a subpoena served by ICE agents
• Speak with ICE agents at all
City officers or employees shall not consent to a warrantless search by
ICE agents of a non-public area or non-public City records.
Employees must immediately notify site director/supervisor to report
the interaction or warrants served. The site director/supervisor must
immediately notify the Department Director for review and consultation
with the City Attorney.
1. If any City resident has questions regarding their immigration status, City staff shall
not refer them to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement or any other government
agency. Instead City staff shall refer such individuals to local non-profit immigration
law organizations. A list of such organizations shall be compiled and disseminated
at City buildings and on the City’s website. The City Manager is also encouraged
to increase and enhance partnerships with community-based organizations, legal
service providers, and educational institutions to provide resources for families and
City residents facing deportation or other adverse immigration actions.
2. All requests for documents by ICE to City personnel shall be immediately forwarded to
the Department Director for review and consultation with the City Attorney to ensure
the safety of City employees and residents, and compliance with applicable state and
federal laws.

415.4 VICTIMS AND WITNESSES
To encourage crime reporting and cooperation in the investigation of criminal activity, all
individuals, regardless of their immigration status, must feel secure that contacting or interacting
with members of the Berkeley Police Department will not automatically lead to an immigration
inquiry and/or deportation. While it may be necessary to determine the identity of a victim or
witness, members of the Berkeley Police Department shall treat all individuals equally and without
regard to race, ethnicity or national origin in any way that would violate the United States or
California constitutions.
415.5 IMMIGRATION INQUIRIES PROHIBITED
Officers shall not inquire into an individual’s immigration status for immigration enforcement
purposes (Government Code § 7284.6).
415.6 DETENTIONS AND ARRESTS

enforcement purposes, including: inquiring into an individual’s immigration status; detaining an
individual on the basis of a hold request; providing information regarding a person’s release date
in response to a notification request from immigration authorities; providing personal information
about an individual including but not limited to the individual home address or work address;
making or participating in arrests based on civil immigration warrants; assisting immigration
authorities in enforcement activities, or performing the functions of an immigration officer.
(Government Code § 7284.6).
An officer shall not detain any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal
immigration laws, or a related civil warrant, or for any violation of federal immigration laws
(Government Code § 7284.6).
415.7 FEDERAL REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE
Absent an urgent issue of officer safety or other emergency circumstances, requests by federal
immigration Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officials for assistance from this
department should be immediately directed to the Watch Commander. ICE’s ERO is the principal
immigration enforcement division. The Watch Commander shall be responsible for determining
whether the requested assistance would be permitted under City policy and the California Values
Act (Government Code § 7284.2 et seq.). The Watch Commander shall decline requests for
assistance from ERO officials for immigration enforcement purposes, and notify the Chief of Police
through the chain of command regarding the request as soon as practical.
Should a request be received for an urgent issue of officer safety or other emergency
circumstance, the Communications Center should notify the Watch Commander or senior
sergeant on duty, who should coordinate a response in order to make a scene safe, respond to
the scene to manage the incident, and notify the Chief of Police through the chain of command
as soon as practical.

Should a request be received for operational assistance from ICE’s Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) unit, the Commander shall convey the request to the Chief of Police through
the chain of command for consideration. HSI investigates transnational crimes which can imperil
local community safety, such as Counter-Terrorism, Child Exploitation, Human Trafficking/Human
Smuggling and Transnational Gangs and Narcotics Trafficking. Assistance may be provided so
long as the other provisions of this policy are followed.
415.7.1 IMMIGRATION DETAINERS
No individual should be held based solely on a federal immigration detainer under 8 CFR 287.7
(Government Code § 7284.6).
Notification to a federal authority may only be made in connection with an outstanding criminal
warrant.
415.7.2 NOTICE TO INDIVIDUALS
Individuals in custody shall be given a copy of documentation received from U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding a hold, notification, or transfer request along with an
advisement that the Berkeley Police Department will not comply with the request (Government
Code § 7283.1).
If, pursuant to court order, the Berkeley Police Department provides ICE with notification that an
individual is being, or will be, released on a certain date, the same notification shall be provided
in writing to the individual and to his/her attorney or to one additional person who the individual
may designate (Government Code § 7283.1). Unless required by federal or state law, or court
order, the Berkeley Police Department shall not provide information to ICE about an individual’s
release date.
415.7.3 ICE INTERVIEWS
The Berkeley Police Department shall not provide ICE personnel access to the Berkeley jail to
interview any individual in custody about civil immigration violations.
415.7.4 TRANSFERS TO IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES

416.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The City Public Works Department has personnel available to handle emergency calls 24
hours per day. Calls for service during non-business hours are frequently directed to the Police
Department. Requests for such service received by this department should be handled in the
following manner.
416.1.2 BROKEN WATER LINES
The City's responsibility ends at the water meter; any break or malfunction in the water system
from the water meter to the citizen's residence or business is the customer's responsibility. Public
Works can only turn off the valve at the meter. The citizen can normally accomplish this.
If a break occurs on the City side of the meter, emergency personnel should be called as soon
as practical by the Communications Center.
416.1.3 ELECTRICAL LINES
City Public Works does not maintain electrical lines to street light poles. When a power line poses
a hazard, an officer should be dispatched to protect against personal injury or property damage
that might be caused by power lines. The Electric Company or Public Works should be promptly
notified, as appropriate.
416.1.4 RESERVOIRS, PUMPS, WELLS, ETC.
Public Works maintains the reservoirs and public water equipment, as well as several underpass
and other street drainage pumps. In the event of flooding or equipment malfunctions, emergency
personnel should be contacted as soon as possible.
416.1.5 EMERGENCY NUMBERS
A current list of emergency personnel who are to be called for municipal utility emergencies is
maintained by the Communications Center.
416.2 TRAFFIC SIGNAL MAINTENANCE
Public Works is responsible for the maintenance of all traffic signals within the City.
416.2.1 OFFICER’S RESPONSIBILITY
Upon observing a damaged or malfunctioning signal, the officer will advise the the

Aircraft Accidents
417.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide department members with guidelines for handling aircraft
accidents.
This policy does not supersede, and is supplementary to, applicable portions of the Crime and
Disaster Scene Integrity, Disaster Response Plan and Hazardous Material Response policies.
417.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Aircraft - Any fixed wing aircraft, rotorcraft, balloon, blimp/dirigible or glider that is capable of
carrying a person or any unmanned aerial vehicle other than those intended for non-commercial
recreational use.
417.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to provide an appropriate emergency response
to aircraft accidents. This includes emergency medical care and scene management.
417.3 ARRIVAL AT SCENE
Officers or other authorized members tasked with initial scene management should establish an
inner and outer perimeter to:
(a) Protect persons and property.
(b) Prevent any disturbance or further damage to the wreckage or debris, except to
preserve life or rescue the injured.
(c) Preserve ground scars and marks made by the aircraft.
(d) Manage the admission and access of public safety and medical personnel to the extent
necessary to preserve life or to stabilize hazardous materials.
(e) Maintain a record of persons who enter the accident site.
(f) Consider implementation of an Incident Command System (ICS).
417.4 INJURIES AND CASUALTIES
Members should address emergency medical issues and provide care as a first priority.

417.5 NOTIFICATIONS
When an aircraft accident is reported to this department, the responding supervisor shall ensure
notification is or has been made to NTSB, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and when
applicable, the appropriate branch of the military.
Supervisors shall ensure other notifications are made once an aircraft accident has been reported.
The notifications will vary depending on the type of accident, extent of injuries or damage, and
the type of aircraft involved. When an aircraft accident has occurred, it is generally necessary to
notify the following:
(a) Fire department
(b) Appropriate airport tower
(c) Emergency medical services (EMS)
417.6 CONTROLLING ACCESS AND SCENE AUTHORITY
Prior to NTSB arrival, scene access should be limited to authorized personnel from the:

decontamination teams, fuel recovery specialists, explosive ordnance disposal
specialists).
The NTSB has primary responsibility for investigating accidents involving civil aircrafts. In the case
of a military aircraft accident, the appropriate branch of the military will have primary investigation
responsibility.
After the NTSB or military representative arrives on-scene, the efforts of this department will shift
to a support role for those agencies.
If the NTSB or a military representative determines that an aircraft or accident does not qualify
under its jurisdiction, the on-scene department supervisor should ensure the accident is still
appropriately investigated and documented.

Obtaining Air Support
418.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The use of a police helicopter can be invaluable in certain situations. This policy specifies potential
situations where the use of a helicopter may be requested and the responsibilities for making a
request.
418.2 REQUEST FOR HELICOPTER ASSISTANCE
If a supervisor or officer in charge of an incident determines that the use of a helicopter would
be beneficial, a request to obtain helicopter assistance may be made to the City Manager. If it is
an emergency situation wherein the City Manager is not immediately available, the request may
be made to the Chief of Police.
418.2.1 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER AGENCY
After consideration and approval of the request for a helicopter, the Watch Commander, or his/her
designee, will request the Communications Center contact the closest agency having helicopter
support available. The Communications Center will apprise that agency of the specific details of
the incident prompting the request.
418.2.2 CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AID MAY BE REQUESTED (PER CITY
COUNCIL RESOLUTION NO. 51.408 N.S.)
Police use of helicopters from other law enforcement agencies is permitted upon approval of the
City Manager (or upon approval of the Chief of Police in emergency situations when the City
Manager is not immediately available) in the following circumstances:
(a) To assist in case of a disaster; or
(b) To assist in rescue efforts (specifically excluding the rescue of hostages); or
(c) To assist in locating missing persons.
While it is recognized that the availability of helicopter support will generally provide valuable
assistance to ground personnel, the presence of a helicopter will rarely replace the need for officers
on the ground.

Law Enforcement Manual
Foot Pursuits
420.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines to assist officers in making the decision to initiate or continue the
pursuit of suspects on foot.
420.2 POLICY
It is the policy of this department that officers, when deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit,
continuously balance the objective of apprehending the suspect with the risk and potential for
injury to department members, the public or the suspect.
Officers are expected to act reasonably, based on the totality of the circumstances.
420.3 DECISION TO PURSUE
The safety of department members and the public shall be one of the primary consideration when
determining whether a foot pursuit should be initiated or continued. Officers must be mindful that
immediate apprehension of a suspect may not outweigh the safety of the public and department
members, depending on the seriousness of the suspect's actions and danger he or she may
immediately pose to the public if not immediately apprehended.
Officers may be justified in initiating a foot pursuit of any individual the officer reasonably believes
is about to engage in, is engaging in or has engaged in criminal activity. The decision to initiate
or continue such a foot pursuit, however, must be continuously re-evaluated in light of the
circumstances presented at the time.
Mere flight by a person who is not suspected of criminal activity shall not serve as justification for
engaging in an extended foot pursuit without the development of reasonable suspicion regarding
the individual’s involvement in criminal activity or being wanted by law enforcement.
Deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit is a decision that an officer must make quickly and
under unpredictable and dynamic circumstances. It is recognized that foot pursuits may place
department members and the public at significant risk. Therefore, no officer or supervisor shall
be criticized or disciplined for deciding not to engage in a foot pursuit because of the perceived
risk involved.
If circumstances permit, surveillance and containment are generally the safest tactics for
apprehending fleeing persons. In deciding whether to initiate or continue a foot pursuit, an officer
should consider reasonable alternatives to a foot pursuit based upon the circumstances and
resources available, such as:
(a) Containment of the area.
(b) Saturation of the area with law enforcement personnel, including assistance from other
agencies.
(c) A canine search.
(d) Thermal imaging or other sensing technology.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Foot Pursuits - 378
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Foot Pursuits
(e) Air support.
(f) Apprehension at another time when the identity of the suspect is known or there is
information available that would likely allow for later apprehension, and the need to
immediately apprehend the suspect does not reasonably appear to outweigh the risk
of continuing the foot pursuit.
420.4 GENERAL GUIDELINES
When reasonably practicable, officers should consider alternatives to engaging in or continuing
a foot pursuit when:
(a) Directed by a supervisor to terminate the foot pursuit; such an order shall be
considered mandatory
(b) The officer is acting alone.
(c) Two or more officers become separated, lose visual contact with one another, or
obstacles separate them to the degree that they cannot immediately assist each other
should a confrontation take place. In such circumstances, it is generally recommended
that a single officer keep the suspect in sight from a safe distance and coordinate the
containment effort.
(d) The officer is unsure of his/her location and direction of travel.
(e) The officer is pursuing multiple suspects and it is not reasonable to believe that the
officer would be able to control the suspect should a confrontation occur.
(f) The physical condition of the officer renders him/her incapable of controlling the
suspect if apprehended.
(g) The officer loses radio contact with the dispatcher or with assisting or backup officers.
(h) The suspect enters a building, structure, confined space, isolated area or dense or
difficult terrain, and there are insufficient officers to provide backup and containment.
The primary officer should consider discontinuing the foot pursuit and coordinating
containment pending the arrival of sufficient resources.
(i) The officer becomes aware of unanticipated or unforeseen circumstances that
unreasonably increase the risk to officers or the public.
(j) The officer reasonably believes that the danger to the pursuing officers or public
outweighs the objective of immediate apprehension.
(k) The officer loses possession of his/her firearm or other essential equipment.
(l) The officer or a third party is injured during the pursuit, requiring immediate assistance,
and there are no other emergency personnel available to render assistance.
(m) The suspect’s location is no longer definitely known.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Foot Pursuits - 379

Foot Pursuits
(n) The identity of the suspect is established or other information exists that will allow for
the suspect’s apprehension at a later time, and it reasonably appears that there is no
immediate threat to department members or the public if the suspect is not immediately
apprehended.
(o) The officer’s ability to safely continue the pursuit is impaired by inclement weather,
darkness or other environmental conditions.
420.5 RESPONSIBILITIES IN FOOT PURSUITS
420.5.1 INITIATING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
Unless relieved by another officer or a supervisor, the initiating officer shall be responsible for
coordinating the progress of the pursuit. When acting alone and when practicable, the initiating
officer should not attempt to overtake and confront the suspect but should attempt to keep the
suspect in sight until sufficient officers are present to safely apprehend the suspect.
Early communication of available information from the involved officers is essential so that
adequate resources can be coordinated and deployed to bring a foot pursuit to a safe conclusion.
Officers initiating a foot pursuit should, at a minimum, broadcast the following information as soon
as it becomes practicable and available:
(a) Location and direction of travel
(b) Call sign identifier
(c) Reason for the foot pursuit, such as the crime classification
(d) Number of suspects and description, to include name if known
(e) Whether the suspect is known or believed to be armed with a dangerous weapon
Officers should be mindful that radio transmissions made while running may be difficult to
understand and may need to be repeated.
Absent extenuating circumstances, any officer unable to promptly and effectively broadcast this
information should terminate the foot pursuit. If the foot pursuit is discontinued for any reason,
immediate efforts for containment should be established and alternatives considered based upon
the circumstances and available resources.
When a foot pursuit terminates, the officer will broadcast his/her location and the status of the
pursuit termination (e.g., suspect in custody, lost sight of suspect), and will direct further actions as
reasonably appear necessary, to include requesting medical aid as needed for officers, suspects
or members of the public.
420.5.2 ASSISTING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
Whenever any officer announces that he/she is engaged in a foot pursuit, all other officers should
minimize non-essential radio traffic to permit the involved officers maximum access to the radio
frequency.

420.5.3 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon becoming aware of a foot pursuit, the supervisor shall make every reasonable effort to
ascertain sufficient information to direct responding resources and to take command, control and
coordination of the foot pursuit. The supervisor should respond to the area whenever possible;
the supervisor does not, however, need not be physically present to exercise control over the foot
pursuit. The supervisor shall continuously assess the situation in order to ensure the foot pursuit
is conducted within established department guidelines.
The supervisor shall terminate the foot pursuit when the danger to pursuing officers or the public
appears to unreasonably outweigh the objective of immediate apprehension of the suspect.
Upon apprehension of the suspect, the supervisor shall promptly proceed to the termination point
to direct the post-foot pursuit activity.
420.5.4 THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon notification or becoming aware that a foot pursuit is in progress, the dispatcher is responsible
for:
(a) Clearing the radio channel of non-emergency traffic.
(b) Coordinating pursuit communications of the involved officers.
(c) Broadcasting pursuit updates as well as other pertinent information as necessary.
(d) Ensuring that a field supervisor is notified of the foot pursuit.
(e) Notifying and coordinating with other involved or affected agencies as practicable.
(f) Notifying the Watch Commander as soon as practicable.
(g) Assigning an incident number and logging all pursuit activities.
420.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The initiating officer shall document the incident. Documentation may be accomplished via an
MDT, Field Interview, Incident or Case Report. The following information should be contained in
the report:
(a) Date and time of the foot pursuit.
(b) Initial reason and circumstances surrounding the foot pursuit.
(c) Course and approximate distance of the foot pursuit.
(d) Alleged offenses.
(e) Involved vehicles and officers.
(f) Whether a suspect was apprehended as well as the means and methods used.
1. Any use of force shall be reported and documented in compliance with the Use
of Force Policy.
(g) Arrestee information, if applicable.

supplemental reports as necessary or as directed.
The supervisor reviewing the report will make a preliminary determination that the pursuit appears
to be in compliance with this policy or that additional review and/or follow-up is warranted.
In any case in which a suspect is not apprehended and there is insufficient information to support
further investigation, a supervisor may authorize that the initiating officer need not complete a
formal report.

The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for temporarily detaining but not arresting
persons in the field, conducting field interviews (FI) and pat-down searches, and the taking and
disposition of photographs.
421.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Consensual encounter - When an officer contacts an individual but does not create a detention
through words, actions, or other means. In other words, a reasonable individual would believe that
his/her contact with the officer is voluntary.
Field interview - The brief detainment of an individual, whether on foot or in a vehicle, based
on reasonable suspicion for the purpose of determining the individual's identity and resolving the
officer's suspicions.
Field photographs - Posed photographs taken of a person during a contact, temporary detention,
or arrest in the field. Undercover surveillance photographs of an individual and recordings captured
by the normal operation of a body-worn camera, or public safety camera when persons are not
posed for the purpose of photographing are not considered field photographs.
Pat-down search - A type of search used by officers in the field to check an individual for
dangerous weapons. It involves a thorough patting-down of clothing to locate any weapons or
dangerous items that could pose a danger to the officer, the detainee, or others.
Reasonable suspicion - When, under the totality of the circumstances, an officer has articulable
facts that criminal activity may be afoot and a particular person is connected with that possible
criminal activity.
Temporary detention - When an officer intentionally, through words, actions, or physical force,
causes an individual to reasonably believe he/she is required to restrict his/her movement without
an actual arrest. Temporary detentions also occur when an officer actually restrains a person's
freedom of movement.
421.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department respects the right of the public to be free from unreasonable
searches or seizures. Due to an unlimited variety of situations confronting the officer, the decision
to temporarily detain a person and complete a field interview (FI), pat-down search, or field
photograph shall be left to the officer based on the totality of the circumstances, officer safety
considerations, and constitutional safeguards.
421.3 FIELD INTERVIEWS
Based on observance of suspicious circumstances or upon information from investigation, an
officer may initiate the stop of a person, and conduct an FI, when there is articulable, reasonable

Contacts and Temporary Detentions
suspicion to do so. A person, however, shall not be detained longer than is reasonably necessary
to resolve the officer’s suspicion.
Nothing in this policy is intended to discourage consensual contacts. Frequent casual contact with
consenting individuals is encouraged by the Berkeley Police Department to strengthen community
involvement, community awareness, and problem identification.
421.3.1 INITIATING A FIELD INTERVIEW
When initiating the stop, the officer should be able to point to specific facts which, when considered
with the totality of the circumstances, reasonably warrant the stop. Such facts include but are not
limited to an individual’s:
(a) Appearance or demeanor suggesting that he/she is part of a criminal enterprise or is
engaged in a criminal act
(b) Actions suggesting that he/she is engaged in a criminal activity
(c) Presence in an area at an inappropriate hour of the day or night
(d) Presence in a particular area is suspicious
(e) Carrying of suspicious objects or items
(f) Excessive clothes for the climate or clothes bulging in a manner that suggest he/she
is carrying a dangerous weapon
(g) Location in proximate time and place to an alleged crime
(h) Physical description or clothing worn that matches a suspect in a recent crime
(i) Prior criminal record or involvement in criminal activity as known by the officer
421.4 PAT-DOWN SEARCHES
Once a valid stop has been made, and consistent with the officer’s training and experience, an
officer may pat a suspect’s outer clothing for weapons if the officer has a reasonable, articulable
suspicion the suspect may pose a safety risk. The purpose of this limited search is not to discover
evidence of a crime, but to allow the officer to pursue the investigation without fear of violence.
Circumstances that may establish justification for performing a pat-down search include but are
not limited to:
(a) The type of crime suspected, particularly in crimes of violence where the use or threat
of deadly weapons is involved.
(b) Where more than one suspect must be handled by a single officer.
(c) The hour of the day and the location or neighborhood where the stop takes place.
(d) Prior knowledge of the suspect's use of force and/or propensity to carry weapons.
(e) The actions and demeanor of the suspect.
(f) Visual indications which suggest that the suspect is carrying a firearm or other weapon.
Whenever practicable, a pat-down search should not be conducted by a lone officer. A cover
officershould be positioned to ensure safety and should not be involved in the search.

421.5 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS
All available databases should be searched before photographing any field detainee. If a
photograph is not located, or if an existing photograph no longer resembles the detainee, the
officer shall carefully consider, among other things, the factors listed below.
421.5.1 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITH CONSENT
Field photographs may be taken when the subject being photographed knowingly and voluntarily
gives consent. When taking a consensual photograph, the officer should have the individual read
and sign the appropriate form accompanying the photograph.
421.5.2 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT
Field photographs may be taken without consent only if they are taken during a detention that
is based upon reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and the photograph serves a legitimate
law enforcement purpose related to the detention. The officer must be able to articulate facts that
reasonably indicate that the subject was involved in or was about to become involved in criminal
conduct.
If, prior to taking a photograph, the officer's reasonable suspicion of criminal activity has been
dispelled, the detention must cease and the photograph should not be taken.
All field photographs and related reports shall be submitted to a supervisor and retained in
compliance with this policy.
421.5.3 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
While it is recognized that field photographs often become valuable investigative tools, supervisors
should monitor such practices in view of the above listed considerations. This is not to imply that
supervisor approval is required before each photograph is taken.
Access to, and use of, field photographs shall be strictly limited to law enforcement purposes.
421.6 WITNESS IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVIEWS
Because potential witnesses to an incident may become unavailable or the integrity of their
statements compromised with the passage of time, officers should, when warranted by the
seriousness of the case, take reasonable steps to promptly coordinate with an on-scene supervisor
and/or criminal investigator to utilize available members for the following:
(a) Identifying all persons present at the scene and in the immediate area.
1. When feasible, a recorded statement should be obtained from those who claim
not to have witnessed the incident but who were present at the time it occurred.
2. Any potential witness who is unwilling or unable to remain available for a
formal interview shall not be detained absent reasonable suspicion to detain or
probable cause to arrest. Without detaining the individual for the sole purpose
of identification, officers should attempt to identify the witness prior to his/her
departure.

(b) Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet at a
suitable location where criminal investigators may obtain a recorded statement. Such
witnesses, if willing, may be transported by Berkeley Police Department members.
1. A written, verbal, or recorded statement of consent should be obtained prior to
transporting a witness. When the witness is a minor, consent should be obtained
from the parent or guardian, if available, prior to transport.
421.7 DISPOSITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS
All detainee photographs must be assigned an incident or case number and uploaded to the BPD
evidence database or booked into the property room.

Fixed Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
422.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the capture, storage, and use of digital data
obtained through the use of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology. Department
Personnel shall adhere to the requirements of Fixed ALPRs in this policy as well as the
corresponding Surveillance Use-Fixed ALPRs policy-1305
422.2 POLICY
The policy of the Berkeley Police Department is to utilize ALPR technology to capture and store
digital license plate data and images while recognizing the established privacy rights of the public
All data and images gathered by the ALPR are for the official use of this department. Because
such data may contain confidential information, it is not open to public review
The Berkeley Police Department does not permit the sharing of ALPR data gathered by the City
or its contractors/subcontractors for federal immigration enforcement, pursuant to the California
Values Act (Government Code § 7282.5; Government Code § 7284.2 et seq) – these federal
immigration agencies include Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and
Border Patrol (CBP).
422.3 DEFINITIONS
(a) Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR): A device that uses cameras and computer
technology to compare digital images to lists of known information of interest.
(b) ALPR Operator: Trained Department members who may utilize ALPR system/
equipment. ALPR operators may be assigned to any position within the Department,
and the ALPR Administrator may order the deployment of the ALPR systems for use
in various efforts.
(c) ALPR Administrator: The Investigations Bureau Captain or the Chief's designee,
serves as the ALPR Administrator for the Department.
(d) Hot List: A list of license plates associated with vehicles of interest compiled from one
or more databases including, but not limited to, NCIC, CA DMV, Local BOLO's, etc.

specific reason including, but not limited to, being related to a stolen car, wanted
person, missing person, domestic violation protective order or terrorist-related activity.
422.4 ADMINISTRATION
The ALPR technology, also known as License Plate Recognition (LPR), allows for the automated
detection of license plates. It is used by the Berkeley Police Department to convert data associated
with vehicle license plates for official law enforcement purposes, including identifying stolen
or wanted vehicles, stolen license plates and missing persons. It may also be used to gather
information related to active warrants, suspect apprehension and stolen property recovery.
Any installation and maintenance of ALPR equipment, as well as ALPR data retention and access,
shall be managed by the Investigations Division Captain. The Investigations Division Captain will
assign members under his/her command to administer the day-to-day operation of the ALPR
equipment and data.
422.4.1 ALPR ADMINISTRATOR
The Investigations Division Captain, or his/her designee, shall be responsible for compliance with
the requirements ofCivil Code § 1798.90.5 et seq. This includes, but is not limited to (Civil Code
§ 1798.90.51; Civil Code § 1798.90.53):
(a) Only properly trained sworn officers, crime analysts, communication operators,
records clerks, parking enforcement officers, and police assistants are allowed access
to the ALPR system or to collect ALPR information.
(b) Ensuring that training requirements are completed for authorized users.
(c) ALPR system monitoring to ensure the security of the information and compliance with
applicable privacy laws.
(d) Ensuring procedures are followed for system operators to maintain records of access
in compliance with Civil Code § 1798.90.52.
(e) The title and name of the current designee in overseeing the ALPR operation.
(f) Working with the Custodian of Records, or vendor on the retention and destruction
of ALPR data.ensuring this policy and related procedures are conspicuously posted
on the City's website.
422.5 OPERATIONS
An ALPR shall only be used for official law enforcement business.
Use of an ALPR is restricted to the purposes outlined below. Department members shall not use,
or allow others to use the equipment or database records for any unauthorized purpose (Civil
Code § 1798.90.51; Civil Code § 1798.90.53).
(a) An ALPR shall only be used for official law enforcement business.
(b) An ALPR may be used in conjunction with any routine patrol operation or to support
criminal investigations. Reasonable suspicion or probable cause is not required before
using an ALPR database.

Law Enforcement Manual
Fixed Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
(c) Partial license plates and unique vehicle descriptions reported during crimes may be
entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect vehicles.
(d) No member of this department shall operate ALPR equipment or access ALPR data
without first completing department-approved training.
(e) If feasible, the officer should verify an ALPR response through the California Law
Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) before taking enforcement action
that is based solely on an ALPR alert. Once an alert is received, the operator should
confirm that the observed license plate from the system matches the license plate of
the observed vehicle. Before any law enforcement action is taken because of an ALPR
alert, the alert will be verified through a CLETS inquiry via MDT or through Dispatch.
(f) Members will not take any police action that restricts the freedom of any individual
based solely on an ALPR alert unless it has been validated. Because the ALPR alert
may relate to a vehicle and may not relate to the person operating the vehicle, officers
are reminded that they need to have reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause to
make an enforcement stop of any vehicle. (For example, if a vehicle is entered into the
system because of its association with a wanted individual, Officers should attempt to
visually match the driver to the description of the wanted subject prior to making the
stop or should have another legal basis for making the stop.)
(g) Hot Lists. Designation of hot lists to be utilized by the ALPR system shall be made by
the ALPR Administrator or his/her designee. Hot lists shall be obtained or compiled
from sources as may be consistent with the purposes of the ALPR system set forth
in this Policy. Hot lists utilized by the Department's LPR system may be updated by
agency sources more frequently than the Department may be uploading them and thus
the Department's LPR system will not have access to real time data. Occasionally,
there may be errors in the LPR system's read of a license plate. Therefore, an
alert alone shall not be a basis for police action (other than following the vehicle of
interest). Prior to initiation of a stop of a vehicle or other intervention based on an alert,
Department members shall undertake the following:
1. Verification of status on a Hot List. An officer must receive confirmation, from
a Berkeley Police Department Communications Dispatcher or other department
computer device, that the license plate is still stolen, wanted, or otherwise of interest
before proceeding (absent exigent circumstances).
2. Visual verification of license plate number. Officers shall visually verify that the license
plate of interest matches identically with the image of the license plate number
captured (read) by the LPR, including both the alphanumeric characters of the license
plate, state of issue, and vehicle descriptors before proceeding. Department members
alerted to the fact that an observed motor vehicle's license plate is entered as a
Hot Plate (hit) in a specific BOLO (be on the lookout) list are required to make a
reasonable effort to confirm that a wanted person is actually in the vehicle and/or that
a reasonable basis exists before a Department member would have a lawful basis to
stop the vehicle.
3. Department members will clear all stops from hot list alerts by indicating the positive
ALPR Hit, i.e., with an arrest or other enforcement action. If it is not obvious in the text
of the call as to the correlation of the ALPR Hit and the arrest, then the Department

member shall update with the Communications Dispatcher and original person and/or
a crime analyst inputting the vehicle in the hot list (hit).
4. General Hot Lists (SVS, SFR, and SLR) will be automatically downloaded into the
ALPR system a minimum of once a day with the most current data overwriting the
old data.
5. All entries and updates of specific Hot Lists within the ALPR system will be
documented by the requesting Department member within the appropriate general
offense report. As such, specific Hot Lists shall be approved by the ALPR
Administrator.
6. Administrator (or his/her designee) before initial entry within the ALPR system. The
updating of such a list within the ALPR system shall thereafter be accomplished
pursuant to the approval of the Department member's immediate supervisor. The hits
from these data sources should be viewed as informational; created solely to bring the
officer's attention to specific vehicles that have been associated with criminal activity.
All Hot Plates and suspect information entered into the ALPR system will
contain the following information as a minimum:
o Entering Department member's name
o Related case number.
o Short synopsis describing the nature of the originating call
(a) Login/Log-Out Procedure. To ensure proper operation and facilitate oversight of the
ALPR system, all users will be required to have individual credentials for access and
use of the systems and/or data, which has the ability to be fully audited.
Permitted/Impermissible Uses. The ALPR system, and all data collected, is the property of the
Berkeley Police Department. Department personnel may only access and use the ALPR system
for official and legitimate California law enforcement purposes consistent with this Policy. The
following uses of the ALPR system are specifically prohibited:
1. Invasion of Privacy: Except when done pursuant to a court order such as a search
warrant, is a violation of this Policy to utilize the ALPR to record license plates except
those of vehicles that are exposed to public view (e.g., vehicles on a public road or
street, or that are on private property but whose license plate(s) are visible from a
public road, street, or a place to which members of the public have access, such as
the parking lot of a shop or other business establishment).
2. Harassment or Intimidation: It is a violation of this Policy to use the ALPR system to
harass and/or intimidate any individual or group.
3. Use Based on a Protected Characteristic. It is a violation of this policy to use the LPR
system or associated scan files or hot lists solely because of a person's, or group's
race, gender, religion, political affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
disability, or other classification protected by law.
4. Personal Use: It is a violation of this Policy to use the ALPR system or associated
scan files or hot lists for any personal purpose.

5. First Amendment Rights. It is a violation of this policy to use the LPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists for the purpose or known effect of infringing upon
First Amendment rights.
(a) Anyone who intentionally engages in an impermissible use of the ALPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists shall be subject to administrative sanctions, up
to and including termination, pursuant to and consistent with the relevant collective
bargaining agreements and departmental policies. Partial license plates reported
during crimes may be entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect
vehicles.
(b) Anyone who negligently engages in an impermissible use of the ALPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists may be subject to administrative sanctions, up to
and including termination, pursuant to and consistent with the relevant collective
bargaining agreements and departmental policies. Partial license plates reported
during crimes may be entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect
vehicles.
No ALPR operator may access California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System
(CLETS) data unless otherwise authorized to do so. If practicable, the officer should verify an
ALPR response through the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS)
before taking enforcement action that is based solely on an ALPR alert.
422.6 DATA COLLECTION AND RETENTION
The Investigations Division Captain is responsible for ensuring systems and processes are in
place for the proper collection and retention of ALPR data. Data will be transferred from vehicles
to the designated storage in accordance with department procedures. Evidentiary hit data shall
be transferred into the Department's digital evidence repository through secure integration.
All ALPR data downloaded to the ALPR server should be stored for no longer than 30 days, and
in accordance with the established records retention schedule. Thereafter, ALPR data should be
purged unless it has become, or it is reasonable to believe it will become, evidence in a criminal
or civil action or is subject to a discovery request or other lawful action to produce records. In
those circumstances the applicable data should be downloaded from the server and uploaded into
BPD's digital evidence repository.
ALPR vendor, will store the data (data hosting) and ensure proper maintenance and security
of data stored in their data towers. The ALPR vendor will purge their data at the end of the 30
days of storage. However, this will not preclude Berkeley Police Department from maintaining any
relevant vehicle data obtained from the system after that period pursuant to the established City
of Berkeley retention schedule mentioned above or outlined elsewhere. Relevant vehicle data are
scans corresponding to the vehicle of interest on a hot list. The ALPR vendor and Department
shall ensure that the necessary data is captured and stored to accurately report the relevant
data required in the Annual Surveillance Technology report. Once the City Council approves the
Annual Surveillance Technology report all said data may be purged so long as it doesn't violate
the Retention guidelines.

accessed, or used for any purpose other than legitimate California law enforcement or public
safety purposes.
422.7 ACCOUNTABILITY
All saved data will be safeguarded and protected by both procedural and technological means.
The Berkeley Police Department will observe the following safeguards regarding access to and
use of stored data (Civil Code § 1798.90.51; Civil Code § 1798.90.53):
(a) Non-law enforcement requests for access to stored ALPR data shall be processed
according to the Records Maintenance and Release Policy in accordance with
applicable law.
(b) All ALPR data downloaded to any workstation or server shall be accessible only
through a login/password-protected system capable of documenting all access of
information by name, date and time (Civil Code § 1798.90.52).
(c) Berkeley Police Department members approved to access ALPR data under these
guidelines are permitted to access the data for legitimate California law enforcement
purposes only, such as when the data relate to a specific criminal investigation or
department-related civil or administrative action.
(d) Aggregated ALPR data not related to specific criminal investigations shall not be
released to any local, state or federal agency or entity without the consent of the
Chief of Police or City Manager (i.e. If transportation department requested volume of
vehicular traffic associated with specific events, it could conceivably be provided with
the count of vehicles, but not the specific license plates with appropriate permissions).
(e) Measures will be taken to ensure the accuracy of ALPR information. Errors discovered
in ALPR data collected by ALPR units shall be marked, corrected or deleted in
accordance with the type and severity of the error in question.
(f) ALPR system audits will be conducted by the Professional Standards Bureau's Audit
and Inspections Sergeant on a regular basis, at least biennial.

Mobile Data Terminal Use
424.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper access, use and application
of the Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) system in order to ensure appropriate access to confidential
records from local, state and national law enforcement databases, and to ensure effective
electronic communications between department members and the Communications Center.
424.2 POLICY
Berkeley Police Department members using the MDT shall comply with all appropriate federal
and state rules and regulations and shall use the MDT in a professional manner, in accordance
with this policy.
424.3 PRIVACY EXPECTATION
Members forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to messages accessed, transmitted,
received or reviewed on any department technology system (see the Information Technology Use
Policy for additional guidance).
424.4 RESTRICTED ACCESS AND USE
MDT use is subject to the Information Technology Use and Protected Information policies.
Members shall not access the MDT system if they have not received prior authorization and the
required training. Members shall immediately report unauthorized access or use of the MDT by
another member to their supervisors or Watch Commanders.
Use of the MDT system to access law enforcement databases or transmit messages is restricted
to official activities, business-related tasks and communications that are directly related to the
business, administration or practices of the Department. In the event that a member has questions
about sending a particular message or accessing a particular database, the member should seek
prior approval from his/her supervisor.
Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive, harassing or any
other inappropriate messages on the MDT system is prohibited and may result in discipline.
It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message or access a law enforcement database under
another member’s name or to use the password of another member to log in to the MDT system
unless directed to do so by a supervisor. Members are required to log off the MDT or secure
the MDT when it is unattended. This added security measure will minimize the potential for
unauthorized access or misuse.
424.4.1 USE WHILE DRIVING
Use of the MDT by the vehicle operator should be limited to times when the vehicle is stopped.
Information that is required for immediate enforcement, investigative, tactical or safety needs
should be transmitted over the radio.

Short transmissions, such as a license plate check, are permitted if it reasonably appears that
it can be done safely. In no case shall an operator attempt to send or review lengthy messages
while the vehicle is in motion.
424.5 DOCUMENTATION OF ACTIVITY
Except as otherwise directed by a supervisor or other department-established protocol, all calls
for service assigned by a dispatcher should be communicated by voice over the police radio and
electronically via the MDT unless security or confidentiality prevents such broadcasting.
MDT and voice transmissions are used to document the member's daily activity. To ensure
accuracy:
(a) All contacts or activity shall be documented at the time of the contact.
(b) Whenever the activity or contact is initiated by voice, it should be documented by a
dispatcher.
(c) Whenever the activity or contact is not initiated by voice, the member shall document
it via the MDT.
424.5.1 STATUS CHANGES
All changes in status (e.g., arrival at scene, meal periods, in service) will be transmitted over the
police radio.
Members responding to in-progress calls should advise changes in status over the radio to assist
other members responding to the same incident.
424.6 EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS
424.6.1 MALFUNCTIONING MDT
Whenever possible, members will not use vehicles with malfunctioning MDTs. Whenever
members must drive a vehicle in which the MDT is not working, they shall notify the
Communications Center. It shall be the responsibility of the dispatcher to document all information
that will then be transmitted verbally over the police radio.
424.6.2 BOMB CALLS
When investigating reports of possible bombs, members should not communicate on their MDTs
when in the evacuation area of a suspected explosive device. Radio frequency emitted by the
MDT could cause some devices to detonate.

425.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for the use of portable Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) by members
of this department while in the performance of their duties.
This policy does not apply to non-BWC evidence, including other methods of audio or video
recordings, interviews or interrogations conducted at any Berkeley Police Department facility,
authorized undercover operations, wiretaps or eavesdropping (concealed listening devices).
425.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes that video recording of contacts between department
personnel and the public provides an objective record of these events, and that the use of a
recording system complements field personnel in the performance of their duties by providing
a video record of enforcement and investigative field contacts, which can enhance criminal
prosecutions, limit civil liability, increase transparency, and enhance professionalism in the
delivery of police services to the community. A video recording of an event or contact also enables
the delivery of timely, relevant, and appropriate training to maximize safety for both community
members and BPD personnel.
While recordings obtained from BWCs provide an objective record of events, it is understood that
video recordings do not necessarily capture all events, activities and information, or reflect the full
experience of the individual member(s) in a given incident. Moreover, the recordings, especially
video, have limitations and may depict events differently than the events as perceived and recalled
by the involved member. Specifically, it is understood that the BWC will capture information that
may not have been seen and/or heard by the involved member and that the involved member may
see and hear information that may not have been captured by the BWC.
425.3 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROPER USE OF RECORDINGS
BWC use is limited to enforcement and investigative activities involving members of the public.
The BWC recordings will capture video and audio evidence for use in criminal investigations,
administrative reviews, training, civil litigation, and other proceedings protected by confidentiality
laws and department policy. Improper use or release of BWC recordings may compromise ongoing
criminal and administrative investigations or violate the privacy rights of those recorded and is
prohibited.
425.4 COORDINATOR
The Chief of Police, or his/her designee shall appoint a member of the Department to coordinate
the use and maintenance of BWCs and the storage of recordings, including (Penal Code § 832.18):
(a) Establishing a system for uploading, storing and security of recordings.
(b) Designating persons responsible for uploading recorded data.
(c) Establishing a maintenance system to ensure availability of BWCs.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 397
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
(d) Establishing a system for tagging and categorizing data according to the type of
incident captured.
(e) Establishing a system to prevent tampering, deleting and copying recordings and
ensure chain of custody integrity.
(f) Working with the City Attorney’s office to ensure an appropriate retention schedule is
being applied to recordings and associated documentation.
(g) Maintaining an audit trail record for all access to evidence files, wherein access
information for each evidence file is logged through use of a secure log-in system.
The Department’s storage system associates an audit trail record with each evidence
file, thereby logging the date, time, user name, activity and client IP address occurring
during each evidence file access.
All recordings made by members acting in their official capacity shall remain the property of the
Department. Subject to the provisions of this Policy, members shall have no expectation of privacy
or ownership interest in the content of these recordings.
425.5 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
Prior to going into service, each uniformed member who is assigned to wear a BWC will be
responsible for making sure that he or she is equipped with a BWC issued by the Department,
and that the BWC is in good working order. If the BWC is not in working order or the member
becomes aware of a malfunction at any time, the member shall promptly report the failure to his/
her supervisor to permit the supervisor or other department employee to provide the member
with a functioning BWC as soon as practicable. Uniformed members should wear the recorder
in a conspicuous manner as prescribed by the Department, to provide a generally unobstructed
camera view of contacts between members of the public and department members.
Members lawfully engaged in their duties as a police officer are not required to obtain consent
from, or give notice to, members of the public, prior to recording with their BWC.
Upon the approval of the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, non-uniformed members lawfully
engaged in their duties as a police officer may use an approved BWC.
Members are required to document the existence of a recording in any report or other official
record of the contact, such as a CAD entry, including any instance where the member is aware that
the BWC malfunctioned or the member deactivated the recording. In the event activity outlined in
section 425.7 is not captured in whole or in part the member shall document this and explain in
their report their understanding, if any, of why the footage was not captured in the recording.
425.6 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
At such time as the scene is considered secure and safe, the on-scene supervisor shall take
immediate physical custody of involved officer’s/officers’ BWC when the device may have captured
an incident involving an officer-involved shooting or use of force resulting in death or great bodily
injury, and shall ensure the data is uploaded in a timely manner as prescribed by BPD policy
(Penal Code § 832.18). Supervisors may review relevant BWC video and audio files in the field
in furtherance of their duties and responsibilities.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 398

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
Supervisors shall also review relevant BWC recordings prior to submitting any administrative
reports.
425.7 ACTIVATION OF THE BODY WORN CAMERA
This policy is not intended to describe every possible situation in which the BWC should be used.
Members shall activate the BWC as required by this policy in (a)-(f) below, and may activate the
BWC at any time the member believes it would be appropriate or valuable to record an incident
within the limits of privacy described herein.
The BWC shall be activated in any of the following situations:
(a) All in-person enforcement and investigative contacts including pedestrian stops and
field interview (FI) situations.
(b) Traffic stops including, but not limited to, traffic violations, stranded motorist assistance
and all crime interdiction stops.
(c) Self-initiated field contacts in which a member would normally notify the
Communications Center.
(d) Any search activity, including the service of search or arrest warrants; probation,
parole, or consent searches where the member is seeking evidence of an offense,
or conducting a safety sweep or community caretaking sweep of the premises. Once
a location has been secured and the member is not interacting with detainees or
arrestees, the member may mute their BWC when conducting a search for evidence.
(e) Any other contact that the member determines has becomes adversarial after the initial
contact in a situation where the member would not otherwise activate BWC recording.
(f) Transporting any detained or arrested person and where a member facilitates entry
into or out of a vehicle, or any time the member expects to have physical contact with
that person.
At no time is a member expected to jeopardize his or her safety in order to activate a BWC.
The BWC should be activated by members in anticipation of situations described above, and in
any unanticipated, rapidly unfolding situation where activation becomes required, as soon as the
member can do so safely.
Members should activate their BWC when conducting custodial interviews unless there are other
recording devices being used. Members shall document and explain in their report the reason for
not recording custodial interviews, should a BWC be de-activated while conducting a custodial
interview or interrogation.
425.8 VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF CRIMES; INFORMANTS
In the event that an officer has the opportunity to record interviews of victims and witnesses of
crimes, they shall consider the following:
(a) Witnesses: In the event a crime witness or a member of the community wishes to
report or discuss criminal activity anonymously, officers have the discretion to not
record. Members may offer to avert their camera to capture only audio during the
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 399
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department

Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
interview, when doing so would facilitate obtaining the witness’s recorded statement.
In cases where a witness requests they not be recorded, and the member agrees not
to record, members should record their request prior to turning the camera off. When
a member is already recording, the member shall record their explanation for turning
the camera off prior to doing so.
(b) Victims: Upon request by the victim, officers have the discretion to not record the
interview. Members may offer to avert their camera to capture only audio during the
interview, when doing so would facilitate obtaining the victim’s recorded statement.
In cases where a victim requests they not be recorded, and the member agrees not
to record, members should record their request prior to turning the camera off. When
a member is already recording, the member shall record their explanation for turning
the camera off prior to doing so.
1. Domestic Violence Victims: Members should attempt to record interviews of
domestic violence victims to facilitate future prosecution efforts and discourage
later recanting of statements. Members should also record interviews with
children who witness domestic violence, when the child is willing.
2. Child Abuse and Sexual Assault Victims: Members shall have the discretion
to record, absent any request to not record the interview by victims, witnesses,
or non-suspect parents of victims, during child abuse and/or sexual assault
investigations.
(c) Informants: Members shall not activate their recorders when conducting an interview
or engaging in a conversation with a confidential informant, unless needed as
evidence.
Members have no obligation to advise a victim or witness that he or she is being recorded, but
may do so at their discretion. When a victim or witness requests they not be recorded, members
may consider their request (See Penal Code 632).
Members shall remain sensitive to the dignity of all individuals being recorded and exercise
discretion to respect privacy by discontinuing recording whenever it reasonably appears to the
member that such privacy concerns may outweigh any legitimate law enforcement interest in
recording. Recording should resume when privacy concerns are no longer at issue unless the
member determines that the circumstances no longer fit the criteria for recording.
Informal community interactions differ from “consensual encounters” in which members make
an effort to develop reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest. To strengthen
relationships between police and citizens, members may use discretion regarding the recording
of informal, non-enforcement related interactions with members of the community.
425.9 ACTIVATION IN CROWD CONTROL SITUATIONS
During crowd control, protest or mass arrest incidents, members shall use their BWCs consistent
with this policy, or when directed by the Incident Commander. The Incident Commander shall
document his or her orders to activate in an appropriate report (e.g. Operations Plan or After
Action Report).
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 400

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
The limitations outlined in the Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities Policy
governing intelligence-gathering procedures for First Amendment activities, apply to the use of
BWCs and other recording devices.
Video recording of individuals who are picketing or engaged in peaceful protest will be avoided
unless the officer believes a violation of criminal law is occurring, may occur, or if the officer
interacts with a participant or third party to the event, or a participant or third party initiates contact
with the member.
425.10 SURREPTITIOUS USE OF THE BWC
Members of the Department may surreptitiously record any conversation during the course of a
criminal investigation in which the member reasonably believes that such a recording will be lawful
and beneficial to the investigation.
Members shall not surreptitiously record another department member without a court order unless
lawfully authorized by the Chief of Police, or his/her designee.
Members are prohibited from using department-issued BWCs for non-work related personal
activity. BWCs will not be activated in places where members have a reasonable expectation of
privacy, such as workplace locker rooms, dressing rooms, members’ private vehicles or restrooms.
425.11 CESSATION OF RECORDING
Once activated, the member may mute or deactivate their BWC at any time based on their
discretion, in the following circumstances:
(a) Discussion of tactical or confidential information with other law enforcement personnel.
(b) Where members are on a perimeter or assigned to a static post where the member’s
direct participation in the incident is complete and they are not actively part of an
investigation.
(c) If it is necessary to discuss issues or concerns with an employee, supervisor, doctor,
nurse, or paramedic in private.
(d) In the member’s judgment, a recording would interfere with his or her ability to conduct
an investigation.
Decisions regarding the reason for muting or BWC deactivation shall be noted on the recording,
or otherwise documented.
Members shall cease audio/video recording whenever necessary to ensure conversations are not
recorded between a person in custody and the person’s attorney, religious advisor or physician,
unless there is explicit consent from all parties to the conversation. This does not apply to
conversations with paramedics or EMTs during their response at a scene, and during transport.
425.12 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
Many portable recorders, including BWCs and audio/video transmitters, emit radio waves that
could trigger an explosive device. Therefore, these devices should not be used where an explosive
device may be present.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 401
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
Members believing that the use of a BWC may detonate an explosive device may deactivate their
BWC in such cases.
425.13 PROHIBITED USE OF BODY WORN CAMERAS
Members are prohibited from using a department-issued BWC for personal use and are prohibited
from making personal copies of recordings created while on duty or while acting in their official
capacity.
Members are prohibited from retaining BWC recordings. Members shall not duplicate or distribute
such recordings, except for department business purposes. All such recordings shall be retained
at the Department.
Members may not use personally owned recorders (e.g. personal cell phone) to document
contacts unless exigent circumstances exist to warrant the use of personally owned recording
devices. Regardless, if a member is using a department-issued BWC, and/or another recording
device, members shall comply with the provisions of this policy, including retention and release
requirements. In every event where members use any recording device aside from or in addition
to their department-issued BWC, the member shall document and explain the use and the exigent
circumstance in their police report (e.g. the BWC failed and evidence needed to be captured at
that moment in time).
Recordings shall not be used by any member for the purpose of embarrassment, intimidation or
ridicule.
425.14 PROCESSING AND HANDLING OF RECORDINGS
To assist with identifying and preserving data and recordings, members shall tag and download
recordings in accordance with procedure, and document the existence of the recording in the
related case report. Transfers must occur at the end of the member’s shift, and any time the
member is aware that the storage capacity of the BWC is nearing its limit. In circumstances when
the officer cannot complete this task, the officer’s supervisor shall immediately take custody of the
BWC and be responsible for uploading the data. Officers shall tag each file with the appropriate
case/incident number, provide a descriptive title, and select an appropriate category for each
recording, using the Axon View app or via the Evidence.com site.
Members are prohibited from intentionally erasing, altering, reusing, modifying or tampering with
original audio video recordings. Members may request restriction and subsequent deletion of an
accidental recording as described under section 425.16 below.
425.15 RETENTION REQUIREMENTS
The Department shall retain all recordings for a minimum of 60 days. Incidents involving
consensual contacts, and aid to citizens will be retained for six months, and cold reports will be
retained for one year. Recordings of incidents involving use of force by a police officer, detentions,
arrests, or recordings relevant to a formal or informal complaint shall be retained for a minimum
of two years and one month. Recordings relating to court cases and personnel complaints that
are being adjudicated will be manually deleted at the same time other evidence associated with

the case is purged in line with the Department’s evidence retention policy. Any recordings related
to administrative or civil proceedings shall be maintained until such matter is fully adjudicated,
at which time it shall be deleted in line with the Department’s evidence retention policy, and any
applicable orders from the court.
Recordings created by equipment testing or accidental activation may be deleted after 60 days.
425.16 ACCIDENTAL RECORDING - REQUEST FOR RESTRICTION
In the event of an accidental or sensitive personal recording of non-departmental business activity,
where the resulting recording is of no investigative or evidentiary value, the recording employee
may request that the file be restricted pending 60-day deletion by submitting an email request
via their chain of command to the Professional Standards Division Captain. The Professional
Standards Division Captain will approve or deny the restriction request. In cases where the request
is denied, an appeal may be submitted to the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, for restriction
authorization. In all cases of restriction requests, a determination should be made within seven
calendar days.
425.17 REVIEW OF RECORDINGS BY A MEMBER
Members are authorized to review their own BWC video files at any time in furtherance of official
business. Such official business includes, but is not limited to, preparing written reports, prior to
or while providing testimony in a case or being deposed. Members may review recordings as an
evidentiary resource, except as stated in subsection 425.17.1 below. Members shall not retain
personal copies of recordings. Members shall not use the fact that a recording was made as a
reason to write a less detailed report.
425.17.1 OFFICER INVOLVED INCIDENTS RESULTING IN GRAVE BODILY INJURY OR
DEATH
(a) In the event of a critical incident that results in grave bodily injury or death, including an
officer-involved shooting or an in-custody death, the BWC of the involved member(s)
shall be taken from him or her and secured by a supervisor, commander, or appropriate
investigator, as necessary. The involved member(s) shall not access or obtain their
footage of the incident until such time as the criminal investigator(s) have reviewed
the video files. It will be the responsibility of the investigation team’s supervisor to
coordinate with the involved member’s supervisor to obtain footage of the incident on
behalf of the member.
(b) Personnel uploading secured BWC video files shall not view the files unless
authorized.
(c) No member involved in a critical incident may view any video recordings prior to
an interview by the appropriate criminal investigative unit, and receiving command
approval.
(d) Prior to the conclusion of the criminal interview process, the involved member and/
or the member’s representative will have an opportunity to review the member’s
recording(s). The involved member may choose to provide additional information to
supplement his or her statement by providing a supplemental statement or separate
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Body Worn Cameras - 403
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Body Worn Cameras
supplemental document. In no case shall a member alter a report made prior to
reviewing the recording.
(e) The Department acknowledges that recordings taken during critical incidents obtained
from BWCs do not necessarily reflect the full extent of the nature of the event or the
experience, analysis, training, threat assessment or state of mind of the individual
officers(s) in a given incident. Moreover, the recordings, especially video, have
limitations and may depict events differently than the events recalled by the involved
officer. Specifically, it is understood that the recording device will capture information
that may not have been heard and/or observed by the involved officer and that officers
may see and hear events that are not captured by the camera.
Officers who are involved in any critical incident where video recordings exist depicting
the involved officer, either as a subject officer or witness, shall be provided the following
admonishment prior to the initial interview or submission of the initial written report:
"In this case, there is video evidence that you will have an opportunity to view. Video
evidence has limitations and may depict the events differently than you recall, and may
not depict all of the events as seen or heard by you. Video has a limited field of view and
may not capture events normally seen by the human eye. The "frame rate” of video may
limit the camera's ability to capture movements normally seen by the human eye. Lighting
as seen on the video may be different than what is seen by the human eye. Videos are a
two-dimensional medium and may not capture depth, distance or positional orientation as
well as the human eye. Remember, the video evidence is intended to assist your memory
and ensure that your statement explains your state of mind at the time of the incident."
425.17.2 SUPERVISORY REVIEW
With the exception of section 425.17.1 above, supervisors are authorized to review relevant
recordings any time they are reviewing and approving case reports from their subordinates.
425.17.3 INVESTIGATORY REVIEW
Supervisors are authorized to review relevant recordings any time they are investigating alleged
misconduct or reports of meritorious conduct, or whenever such recordings support review of the
member’s performance.
Recorded files may also be reviewed:
(a) Upon approval by a supervisor, by any member of the Department who is participating
in conduct of an official investigation, such as a personnel complaint, an administrative
investigation or a criminal investigation.
(b) Pursuant to lawful process or by court or District Attorney personnel who are otherwise
authorized to review evidence in a related case.
(c) By personnel assigned to investigatory units who are authorized to view any BWC
video file associated to their active investigations, unless otherwise prohibited by
policy.

(d) Upon approval by the Chief of Police, Internal Affairs investigators may review BWC
video with a complainant.
Investigators conducting criminal or internal investigations shall:
1. Advise the coordinator to restrict access to the BWC file in criminal or internal
investigations, as necessary.
2. Review the file to determine whether the BWC file is of evidentiary value and process
it in accordance with established protocols.
3. Notify the coordinator to remove the access restriction when the criminal/internal
investigation is closed.
425.17.4 TEACHING OR LEARNING TOOL
BWC files may also be reviewed by training staff regarding specific incidents where such files may
serve as an internal learning or teaching tool. In the event that videos are intended to be used for
training purposes, the involved officer(s) will first be consulted. If he/she objects to the use of the
video, such objection shall be submitted to the person in charge of training who shall weigh the
value of the video for training against the officer(s) objections and basis for the objection. Should
the person in charge of training refuse to grant the request of the involved officer(s), the matter
shall be heard by the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, prior to utilizing the video.
425.17.5 COB CIVIL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS
BWC recordings may be reviewed and used by City of Berkeley defense counsel for the purposes
of defending the city in civil claims and lawsuits, with the authorization of the Chief of Police, or
his/her designee.
425.18 RELEASE OF RECORDINGS
All recordings should be reviewed by the Custodian of Records and the City Attorney’s Office prior
to public release, see General Order R-23 (Release of Public Records and Information).
In the event that the Police Department or City Department intends to release or publish for any
purpose video recordings where officers are captured on video or the video depicts actions taken
by them in the course of the performance of their official duties, those officers shall be given written
notice of the intention to release or publish said video at least 48 hours prior to such release.
BPD may, without prior notice to involved officers, share video footage with law enforcement,
national security, military, or other government agencies outside of Berkeley, when there is
reasonable suspicion that criminal activity has occurred or is about to occur.
425.18.1 POLICE REVIEW COMMISSION (PRC)
Access to recorded files will be granted for the purposes of review to the Police Review
Commission Officer and/or Investigator investigating a specific complaint where BWC evidence
files are available, and are not part of any ongoing criminal investigation.
(a) The PRC Officer and PRC Investigator will be provided user account access to
evidence files through the evidence management system for their use during a

complaint investigation and to facilitate viewing by Board of Inquiry members during
a Board of Inquiry.
(b) The PRC Officer and PRC investigator shall not make or create a copy of any evidence
file, nor make or allow to be made any audio or video recording of any evidence file
while it is being streamed and viewed from the evidence management system.
(c) The PRC Officer and PRC Investigator shall not allow any unauthorized individuals to
view or access evidence files.
(d) The evidence management system associates an audit trail record with each evidence
file, thereby logging the date, time, user, activity, and client IP address occurring during
each evidence file access.
(e) The evidence management system shall only be accessed on City premises.
(f) The Department retains custody and control of the recordings, and content of the
video will be subject to applicable legal standards including, but not limited to the
confidentiality requirements of the Public Safety Officers’ Procedural Bill of Rights,
(Government Code § 3300, et seq., Penal Code § 832.7, and the California Public
Records Act; Government Code § 6250, et seq.)
425.18.2 PUBLIC RECORDS ACT (PRA) REQUEST
Access to recorded files will be granted for the purposes of review in response to a public records
request, as permitted under Government Code § 6254(f) and BPD General Order R-23 (Release of
Public Records and Information). General Order R-23 does not authorize release of investigative
files or documents that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.Circumstances where
this might arise in video include footage taken inside a home, a medical facility, the scene of a
medical emergency, or where an individual recorded has a “reasonable expectation of privacy.”
425.18.3 MEDIA
Access to recorded files will be granted for the purposes of review to media personnel or the
general public with permission of the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, subject to General Order
R-23 and privacy protections indicated in this policy.
425.19 COMPLIANCE WITH BMC 2.99 ACQUISITION AND USE OF SURVEILLANCE
TECHNOLOGY
This policy shall comply at all times with the requirement of BMC 2.99 Acquisition and Use of
Surveillance Technology.

Law Enforcement Manual
Public Recording of Law Enforcement Activity
426.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for handling situations in which members of the public photograph
or audio/video record law enforcement actions and other public activities that involve members
of this department. In addition, this policy provides guidelines for situations where the recordings
may be evidence.
426.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record members of this
department who are performing their official duties. Members of this department will not prohibit or
intentionally interfere with such lawful recordings. Any recordings that are deemed to be evidence
of a crime or relevant to an investigation will only be collected or seized lawfully.
Officers should exercise restraint and should not resort to highly discretionary arrests for offenses
such as interference, failure to comply or disorderly conduct as a means of preventing someone
from exercising the right to record members performing their official duties.
426.3 RECORDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY
Members of the public who wish to observe and/or record law enforcement activities are limited
only in certain aspects.
(a) Recordings may be made from any public place or any private property where the
individual has the legal right to be present (Penal Code § 69; Penal Code § 148).
(b) Beyond the act of photographing or recording, individuals may not interfere with the
law enforcement activity. Examples of interference include, but are not limited to:
1. Tampering with a witness or suspect.
2. Inciting others to violate the law.
3. Being so close to the activity as to present a clear safety hazard to the officers.
4. Being so close to the activity as to interfere with an officer’s effective
communication with a suspect or witness.
(c) The individual may not present an undue safety risk to the officers, him/herself or
others.
426.4 OFFICER RESPONSE
Officers should promptly request that a supervisor respond to the scene whenever it appears
that anyone recording activities may be interfering with an investigation or it is believed that the
recording may be evidence. If practicable, officers should wait for the supervisor to arrive before
taking enforcement action or seizing any cameras or recording media.
Whenever practicable, officers or supervisors should give clear and concise warnings to
individuals who are conducting themselves in a manner that would cause their recording or
behavior to be unlawful. Accompanying the warnings should be clear directions on what an

Public Recording of Law Enforcement Activity
individual can do to be compliant; directions should be specific enough to allow compliance. For
example, rather than directing an individual to clear the area, an officer could advise the person
that he/she may continue observing and recording from the sidewalk across the street.
If an arrest or other significant enforcement activity is taken as the result of a recording that
interferes with law enforcement activity, officers shall document in a report the nature and extent
of the interference or other unlawful behavior and the warnings that were issued.
426.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
A supervisor should respond to the scene when requested or any time the circumstances indicate
a likelihood of interference or other unlawful behavior.
The supervisor should review the situation with the officer and:
(a) Request any additional assistance as needed to ensure a safe environment.
(b) Take a lead role in communicating with individuals who are observing or recording
regarding any appropriate limitations on their location or behavior. When practical, the
encounter should be recorded.
(c) When practicable, allow adequate time for individuals to respond to requests for a
change of location or behavior.
(d) Ensure that any enforcement, seizure or other actions are consistent with this policy
and constitutional and state law.
(e) Explain alternatives for individuals who wish to express concern about the conduct of
Department members, such as how and where to file a complaint.
426.6 SEIZING RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE
Officers should not seize recording devices or media unless (42 USC § 2000aa):
(a) There is probable cause to believe the person recording has committed or is
committing a crime to which the recording relates, and the recording is reasonably
necessary for prosecution of the person.
1. Absent exigency or consent, a warrant should be sought before seizing or
viewing such recordings. Reasonable steps may be taken to prevent erasure of
the recording.
(b) There is reason to believe that the immediate seizure of such recordings is necessary
to prevent serious bodily injury or death of any person.
(c) The person consents.
1. To ensure that the consent is voluntary, the request should not be made in a
threatening or coercive manner.
2. If the original recording is provided, a copy of the recording should be provided
to the recording party, if practicable. The recording party should be permitted to
be present while the copy is being made, if feasible. Another way to obtain the
evidence is to transmit a copy of the recording from a device to a department-
owned device.

427.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide members of this department with guidelines for investigating
the acquisition, possession, transportation, delivery, production or use of marijuana under
California’s medical marijuana laws.
427.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Cardholder - A person issued a current identification card.
Compassionate Use Act (CUA) (Health and Safety Code § 11362.5) - California law intended to
provide protection from prosecution to those who are seriously ill and whose health would benefit
from the use of marijuana in the treatment of illness for which marijuana provides relief. The CUA
does not grant immunity from arrest but rather provides an affirmative defense from prosecution
for possession of medical marijuana.
Identification card - A valid document issued by the California Department of Public Health to
both persons authorized to engage in the medical use of marijuana and also to designated primary
caregivers.
Medical marijuana - Marijuana possessed by a patient or primary caregiver for legitimate medical
purposes.
Medical Marijuana Program (MMP) (Health and Safety Code § 11362.7 et seq.) - California laws
passed following the CUA to facilitate the prompt identification of patients and their designated
primary caregivers in order to avoid unnecessary arrests and provide needed guidance to
law enforcement officers. MMP prohibits arrest for possession of medical marijuana in certain
circumstances and provides a defense in others.
Patient - A person who is entitled to the protections of the CUA because he/she has received
a written or oral recommendation or approval from a physician to use marijuana for medical
purposes or any person issued a valid identification card.
Primary caregiver - A person designated by the patient, who has consistently assumed
responsibility for the patient’s housing, health or safety, who may assist the patient with the medical
use of marijuana under the CUA or the MMP (Health and Safety Code § 11362.5; Health and
Safety Code § 11362.7).
Statutory amount - No more than 8 ounces of dried, mature, processed female marijuana flowers
(“bud”) or the plant conversion (e.g., kief, hash, hash oil), and no more than six mature or 12
immature marijuana plants (roots, stems and stem fibers should not be considered) (Health and
Safety Code § 11362.77).

427.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to prioritize resources to forgo making arrests
related to marijuana that the arresting officer reasonably believes would not be prosecuted by
state or federal authorities.
California’s medical marijuana laws are intended to provide protection to those who are seriously
ill and whose health would benefit from the use of medical marijuana.
However, California medical marijuana laws do not affect federal laws and there is no medical
exception under federal law for the possession or distribution of marijuana. The Berkeley
Police Department will exercise discretion to ensure laws are appropriately enforced without
unreasonably burdening both those individuals protected under California law and public
resources.
427.3 INVESTIGATION
A sworn supervisor shall be summoned to the scene of any situation where a suspect asserts a
claim of medical marijuana prior to any enforcement action being taken. Supervisors are expected
to oversee the investigation to ensure enforcement actions are consistent with this policy.
Investigations involving the possession, delivery, production or use of marijuana generally fall into
one of several categories:
(a) Investigations when no person makes a medicinal claim.
(b) Investigations when a medicinal claim is made by a cardholder.
(c) Investigations when a medicinal claim is made by a non-cardholder.
427.3.1 INVESTIGATIONS WITH NO MEDICINAL CLAIM
In any investigation involving the possession, delivery, production or use of marijuana or drug
paraphernalia where no person claims that the marijuana is used for medicinal purposes, the
officer should proceed with a criminal investigation if the amount is greater than permitted for
personal use under the Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Health and Safety
Code § 11362.1; Health and Safety Code § 11362.2). A medicinal defense may be raised at
any time, so officers should document any statements and observations that may be relevant to
whether the marijuana was possessed or produced for medicinal purposes.
427.3.2 INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING A MEDICINAL CLAIM MADE BY A CARDHOLDER
A cardholder or designated primary caregiver in possession of an identification card shall not be
arrested for possession, transportation, delivery or cultivation of medical marijuana at or below
the statutory amount unless there is probable cause to believe that (Health and Safety Code §
11362.71; Health and Safety Code § 11362.78):
(a) The information contained in the card is false or falsified.
(b) The card has been obtained or used by means of fraud.
(c) The person is otherwise in violation of the provisions of the MMP.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Medical Marijuana - 412
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Medical Marijuana
(d) The person possesses marijuana but not for personal medical purposes.
Officers who reasonably believe that a person who does not have an identification card in his/her
possession has been issued an identification card may treat the investigation as if the person had
the card in his/her possession.
Cardholders may possess, transport, deliver or cultivate medical marijuana in amounts above
the statutory amount if their doctor has concluded that the statutory amount does not meet
the patient’s medical needs (Health and Safety Code § 11362.71; Health and Safety Code §
11362.77). Investigations involving cardholders with more than the statutory amount of marijuana
should be addressed as provided in this policy for a case involving a medicinal claim made by
a non-cardholder.
427.3.3 INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING A MEDICINAL CLAIM MADE BY A NON-
CARDHOLDER
No patient or primary caregiver should be arrested for possession or cultivation of an amount
of medical marijuana if the officer reasonably believes that marijuana is in a form and amount
reasonably related to the qualified patient's current medical needs (Health and Safety Code
§ 11362.5). This arrest guidance also applies to sales, transportation or delivery of medical
marijuana, or maintaining/renting a drug house or building that may be a nuisance if otherwise in
compliance with MMP (Health and Safety Code § 11362.765).
Officers are not obligated to accept a person’s claim of having a physician’s recommendation
when the claim cannot be readily verified with the physician but are expected to use their judgment
to assess the validity of the person’s medical-use claim.
Officers should review any available written documentation for validity and whether it contains
the recommending physician’s name, telephone number, address and medical license number
for verification.
Officers should generally accept verified recommendations by a physician that statutory amounts
do not meet the patient’s needs (Health and Safety Code § 11362.77).
427.3.4 INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING A STATE LICENSEE
No person issued a state license under the Business and Professions Code shall be arrested
or cited for cultivation, possession, manufacture, processing, storing, laboratory testing, labeling,
transporting, distribution or sale of medical cannabis or a medical cannabis product related to
qualifying patients and primary caregivers when conducted lawfully. Whether conduct is lawful
may involve questions of license classifications, local ordinances, specific requirements of the
Business and Professions Code and adopted regulations. Officers should consider conferring with
a supervisor, the applicable state agency or other member with special knowledge in this area and/
or appropriate legal counsel before taking enforcement action against a licensee or an employee
or agent (Business and Professions Code § 26032).

427.3.5 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Officers should consider the following when investigating an incident involving marijuana
possession, delivery, production or use:
(a) Because enforcement of medical marijuana laws can be complex, time consuming and
call for resources unavailable at the time of initial investigation, officers may consider
submitting a report to the prosecutor for review, in lieu of making an arrest. This can
be particularly appropriate when:
1. The suspect has been identified and can be easily located at a later time.
2. The case would benefit from review by a person with expertise in medical
marijuana investigations.
3. Sufficient evidence, such as photographs or samples, has been lawfully
obtained.
4. Other relevant factors, such as available department resources and time
constraints prohibit making an immediate arrest.
(b) Whenever the initial investigation reveals an amount of marijuana greater than the
statutory amount, officers should consider the following when determining whether the
form and amount is reasonably related to the patient’s needs:
1. The amount of marijuana recommended by a medical professional to be
ingested.
2. The method of ingestion (e.g., smoking, eating, nebulizer).
(c) Before proceeding with enforcement related to collective gardens or dispensaries,
officers should consider conferring with a supervisor, an applicable state regulatory
agency or other member with special knowledge in this area and/or appropriate legal
counsel (Business and Professions Code § 26010; Business and Professions Code §
26060). Licensing, zoning and other related issues can be complex. Patients, primary
caregivers and cardholders who collectively or cooperatively cultivate marijuana for
medical purposes may be licensed or may have a defense in certain circumstances
(Business and Professions Code § 26032; Business and Professions Code § 26033).
(d) Investigating members should not order a patient to destroy marijuana plants under
threat of arrest.
427.3.6 EXCEPTIONS
This policy does not apply to, and officers should consider taking enforcement action for the
following:
(a) Persons who engage in illegal conduct that endangers others, such as driving under
the influence of marijuana in violation of the Vehicle Code (Health and Safety Code
§ 11362.5).
(b) Marijuana possession in jails or other correctional facilities that prohibit such
possession (Health and Safety Code § 11362.785).
(c) Smoking marijuana (Health and Safety Code § 11362.79):
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Medical Marijuana - 414
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Medical Marijuana
1. In any place where smoking is prohibited by law.
2. In or within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a school, recreation center or youth
center, unless the medical use occurs within a residence.
3. On a school bus.
4. While in a motor vehicle that is being operated.
5. While operating a boat.
(d) Use of marijuana by a person on probation or parole, or on bail and use is prohibited
by the terms of release (Health and Safety Code § 11362.795).
427.4 FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
Officers should provide information regarding a marijuana investigation to federal law enforcement
authorities when it is requested by federal law enforcement authorities or whenever the officer
believes those authorities would have a particular interest in the information.
427.5 PROPERTY AND EVIDENCE UNIT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
The Property and Evidence Unit supervisor should ensure that marijuana, drug paraphernalia or
other related property seized from a person engaged or assisting in the use of medical marijuana
is not destroyed pending any charges and without a court order. The Property and Evidence Unit
supervisor is not responsible for caring for live marijuana plants.
With the Detective Bureau Lieutenant's approval and upon the prosecutor’s decision to forgo
prosecution, or the dismissal of charges or an acquittal, the Property and Evidence Unit supervisor
should, as soon as practicable, return to the person from whom it was seized any useable medical
marijuana, plants, drug paraphernalia or other related property that was seized as evidence.
Absent approval from the Detective Bureau Lieutenant, the owner should be advised to seek a
court order for the return of the property.
Medical marijuana booked for "safekeeping" may be returned to the listed owner without additional
approval needed.
The Property and Evidence Unit supervisor may release marijuana to federal law enforcement
authorities upon presentation of a valid court order or by a written order of the Detective Bureau
Lieutenant.

428.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to provide policy and procedural guidance to Berkeley Police
Department personnel involved in the planning, response and/or deployment of police personnel
for crowd situations.
428.2 MISSION STATEMENT
The mission of the Berkeley Police Department in crowd situations is to facilitate free expression,
de-escalate violence and resolve conflict peacefully with the overall goal of ensuring public safety
and protecting First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly.
(a) Appropriate action will be determined by the Incident Commander in the field, and will
be based on the behavior of the people in the crowd.
(b) Police action shall be reasonable, intended to prevent lawlessness or restore order,
and may include responses ranging from no police action to full crowd control tactics.
428.3 POLICY
In the event a crowd situation is determined to be a peaceful protest or demonstration, wherein
participants are exercising their rights to free speech in a lawful manner, the policy of the Berkeley
Police Department shall be to facilitate the event to the extent possible.
The Department shall make it a priority to establish lines of communication with the demonstrators
both before and during the crowd situation. The Department shall consider social media as one
means of communication.
In the event that a crowd situation is unlawful, and lack of immediate police action to may lead to
the escalation of criminal behavior and violence, the Berkeley Police Department will take steps
to restore order.
(a) Steps to restore order may include monitoring with minimal police presence, a strong
police presence, selective arrest of those committing crimes or a dispersal order.
(b) Prior to issuing a dispersal order, BPD shall make efforts to safely arrest those
committing crimes while preserving the rights of citizens to demonstrate.
(c) Opportunities to de-escalate from crowd control to crowd management tactics should
be continually evaluated by considering all available resources and deploying them
flexibly.
428.4 USE OF FORCE
Employees who employ force in a crowd control situation shall do so in conformance with policy
set forth in the Use of Force Policy.
(a) Pain compliance techniques (e.g., gum nerve, buckle nerve pressure, etc.), impact
weapons and chemical agents should not be used on persons participating in a crowd
situation who are committing an unlawful act with passive resistance (e.g., sitting or
lying down to block a doorway) solely to effectuate a custodial arrest.

First Amendment Assemblies
1. Verbal commands to stand followed by control holds (e.g., wrist lock, twist lock,
etc.) with reasonable pressure may be utilized to attempt to require an arrestee
who is sitting or lying down to stand up to effectuate a custodial arrest.
2. If an arrestee who is sitting or lying down continues to refuse to stand up in
response to verbal commands followed by pressure applied from a control hold,
the officer should use drag, carry, or roll techniques to effectuate the custodial
arrest.
3. Once an arrestee is standing in a self-supporting manner, the officer may counter
an arrestee's lapse into passive resistance (e.g., attempting to fall or sit down)
with control holds that would likely prevent such a movement.
(b) Officers attempting to move a crowd or individual should not strike anyone who is
unable to move back for reasons out of their control (i.e., physical disability, crowd
surge, being pinned against a fixed object, etc.)
(c) Sworn officers should employ particular applications of force (e.g., a specific baton
strike, such as a "rake" or "jab") as may be directed by their chain of command, when
its use is intended to accomplish a desired crowd control objective.
1. Officers shall not intentionally strike a person with any baton to the head, neck,
throat, kidneys, spine or groin except when the person's conduct is creating
an immediate threat of serious bodily injury or death to an officer or any other
person.
2. Officers on a skirmish line shall not use batons to collectively push a crowd
in a particular direction prior to dispersal orders being given unless exigent
circumstances exist. This requirement does not apply to officers on a skirmish
line who are using force in compliance with Graham v. Conner.
(d) Officers are not precluded from using authorized force, as appropriate, to address the
actions of a particular person(s).
(e) Less-lethal munitions shall only be fired at a specific target and officers shall be mindful
of the increased risk of hitting an unintended target due to unexpected movement of
members of the crowd. Officers may never use less-lethal munitions indiscriminately
against a crowd or group of people.
Personnel deployments during demonstrations should include clear and specific objectives.
In squad or team movement, the type and scope of force used shall be at the discretion of the
Incident Commander, Field Commander, Squad or Team Leader.
De-escalation techniques or other alternatives to force have been attempted, when objectively
reasonable, and have failed prior to the use of any force, consistent with the Department's Use
of Force policy.
Kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents for crowd control purposes shall only be deployed
by officers who have received POST training for crowd control if the use is objectively reasonable
to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury to any individual, including an officer, or to

First Amendment Assemblies
bring an objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely and effectively under control (Penal
Code 13652).
Kinetic energy projectiles or chemical agents shall not be used by any law enforcement agency
solely due to any of the following:
• A violation of an imposed curfew.
• A verbal threat.
• Noncompliance with a law enforcement directive.
For planned events, inventories shall be conducted before and at the conclusion of the incident.
Outside agency inventories shall also be tracked.
The Field Commander shall determine the type and quantity of chemical agents to be used. After
use of chemical agent, the Field Commander shall re-evaluate the scene to determine if additional
chemical agents are needed.
428.5 USE OF VEHICLES
BPD shall enhance mobility and flexibility by using police vehicles such as trained bicycle officers
and motorcycle officers, in addition to foot patrols, to maintain peaceful crowd management.
Parking Enforcement Officers will only be used for traffic control purposes.
Specialized police vehicles (e.g., police motorcycles, off-road motorcycles, parking enforcement
vehicles, mobile command vehicles, etc.) may be used in crowd situations at the discretion of the
Incident Commander.
(a) Specialized police vehicles shall not be used to contact demonstrators for the purpose
of physically pushing people back or forcibly dispersing them from an area.
(b) Specialized police vehicles may be in a MFF line with other marked vehicles as a
visual deterrent.

Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment
Activities
429.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance regarding intelligence gathering procedures
and maintenance of intelligence files. Additionally this policy addresses the investigation of
individuals and groups involved in First Amendment protected activities, and expressly limits such
investigations to situations where a criminal predicate exists.
429.2 CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTION TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
The United States and California Constitutions provide people with the right of privacy, free
expression and free association for any lawful purpose.
The California Constitution expressly provides that “privacy” is an inalienable right. The First
Amendment of the US constitution prohibits the government from making a law establishing a
religion or prohibiting the free exercise of religion, abridging freedom of speech or of the press, or
preventing people from peaceable assembly (e.g., marches and picketing).
While there are certain categories of speech that are not protected (i.e., fighting words, defamation,
etc.), these exceptions are limited and have been narrowly construed.
Under these constitutional restrictions, intelligence gathering by the Police Department is only
permitted to investigate criminal activity. Intelligence gathering should not include political,
religious, or social views or activities of individuals or groups, unless such views or activities
directly relate to criminal conduct.
429.3 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to ensure that the First Amendment rights
guaranteed by the United States Constitution are protected for all individuals and groups, including
the press, and to permit police involvement in the exercise of those rights only to the extent
necessary to provide for the legitimate needs of law enforcement in investigating criminal activity.
The Berkeley Police Department will obtain, maintain and use information from legal, reliable
sources to meet the needs of the Department and the City of Berkeley in carrying out its efforts to
protect the public and suppress criminal activity. When the group or individual being investigated
is involved in constitutionally protected First Amendment activity, the Department will ensure that
there is reasonable suspicion that a criminal predicate exists.
Officers involved in planning for or responding to any protest or event may utilize open source
material and are encouraged to contact the individuals or groups organizing the public event in
order to facilitate traffic control, crowd management, or other safety measures concerning the
event. These measures would not be considered an investigation as defined by this policy.
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes its critical task in balancing the need for law
enforcement in its efforts to protect the broader society, versus the need to safeguard individual

Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities
rights guaranteed by a democratic process. At times, law enforcement may need to resort to the
use of undercover operations, surveillance, and the use of informants to protect the public from
groups espousing violence and/or wanton destruction of property.
429.4 FEDERAL AND STATE GUIDELINES
The guidelines of this policy are based largely on the Californian Attorney General’s Criminal
Intelligence Guidelines and Title 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 23 (28 CFR 23). To the
extent of this policy is more restrictive than the Attorney General’s guidelines or 28 CFR 23, this
policy must be adhered to.
429.5 DEFINITIONS
Criminal Predicate: The standard by which the determination as to whether information may be
used to create an intelligence file is made. It means that there exists a "reasonable suspicion"
based on the analysis of legally obtained information that the subject of the information is or may
be involved in definable criminal conduct and/or activity that supports, encourages, or otherwise
aids definable criminal conduct. For the purposes of this policy, infraction violations will not be
considered sufficient to establish a criminal predicate. The underlying offense must amount to a
misdemeanor or felony.
Reasonable Suspicion: Information which, when viewed in its totality, leads a person with
appropriate training, specialized knowledge, and/or experience to conclude that a person,
association of persons, or organization may be involved in definable criminal conduct and/or
activity that supports, encourages or otherwise aids definable criminal conduct.
Open Source: Any source of news or information that could normally be accessed by any member
of the public. Examples include the television news, newspapers, speeches at any public gathering
or event, the Internet, the public in the form of casual conversations and information brought
forward during routine contacts, the radio, billboards, and flyers. Open source information does not
include meetings, such as planning meetings or closed-door meetings, where First Amendment
protected activities are involved, unless the officers are in uniform and have been invited or are
otherwise in a place they have a lawful right to be.
Informant: Non-law enforcement, non-City employees who are specifically gathering information
on behalf,and at the request of the Berkeley Police Department.
Videotaping: For the purposes of this policy, the videotaping (whether surreptitious or in plain
sight) of individuals or groups involved in First Amendment related activities.
429.6 INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
429.6.1 OPEN SOURCES
Open source information can be accessed at any time by any member of the Department without
reporting requirements, unless otherwise required outside of this policy. Accessing open source
information does not constitute an investigation as defined by this policy. However, files on groups
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities
or organizations containing open source material shall not be created and maintained, absent a
criminal predicate.
Open source information should be validated in compliance with the California Attorney General’s
Criminal Intelligence Guidelines and 28 CFR 23.
429.6.2 PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS
Where the activity is First Amendment related, plainclothes officers may only be used where there
is a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity arising to acts of violence, destruction of property,
or a threat to public safety. Plainclothes officers may be utilized within crowds in public places
involved in First Amendment related activities, but only in order to determine the best response for
Police to safely address traffic-related issues because they would potentially be in danger even in
uniform. In this situation, the plainclothes officers would not be gathering any specific information
about the group or individuals, unless criminal activity occurred, just general information such as
direction of travel, crowd size estimates and destination.
(a) Plainclothes officers shall not be utilized at meetings, such as planning meetings or
closed-door meetings where First Amendment related activities are involved, except
as noted above.
(b) The use of plainclothes officers at planning-meetings, or closed-door meetings where
First Amendment related activities are involved shall require prior approval of the Chief
of Police.
(c) Plainclothes officers shall not, in any circumstance:
1. Attend meetings or engage in other activities for the purpose of obtaining legally-
privileged information, such as confidential sources of reporters, attorney-client
communications, or physician-patient communications;
2. Assume a leadership position or intentionally cause dissension within an
organization;
3. Initiate, propose or suggest, encourage, or incite criminal acts or plans to commit
criminal acts;
4. Use unlawful techniques to obtain information; or
5. Participate in acts of violence or unlawful acts.
429.6.3 INFORMANTS
Informants may be utilized in First Amendment related activities where there is reasonable
suspicion of criminal activity arising to acts of violence, destruction of property, or a threat to public
safety.
(a) Informants shall not be utilized at meetings, such as planning meetings or closed-
door meetings where First Amendment related activities are involved, except as noted
above.
(b) Use of informants where First Amendment related activities are involved would require
prior approval of the Chief of Police and reasonable suspicion of a criminal predicate.

Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities
(c) Information from informants should be validated in compliance with the California
Attorney General’s Criminal Intelligence Guidelines and Title 28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 23 (28 CFR 23).
(d) Informants shall be directed not to:
1. Assume a leadership position or intentionally cause dissension within an
organization;
2. Initiate, propose or suggest, encourage, or incite criminal acts or plans to commit
criminal acts;
3. Use unlawful techniques-to obtain information;
4. Participate in acts of violence or unlawful acts; or
5. Attend meetings or engage in other activities for the purpose of obtaining legally-
privileged information, such as confidential sources of reporters, attorney-client
communications or physician-patient communications.
429.6.4 VIDEOTAPING
Videotaping is a useful tool with which to gather evidence in criminal cases and non-criminal civil
complaints against the City. It is often difficult to ascertain whether criminal activity is going to
break out during a protest, march, or during other protected First Amendment related activities.
Additionally, due to the contentious nature of many of these events, there is often City liability
involved, or the potential for allegations of police misconduct. Videotaping these events serves to
protect both the City and the various constituents involved in these events. As such the Berkeley
Police Department will routinely videotape protests, marches and other acts of protected First
Amendment related activities that occur in public places.
(a) In the event that no criminal predicate exists, no discernable civil liability can be
discovered, and no personnel complaint is received, the tapes, if they are maintained,
will only be maintained as a training tool. Tape that is not used for training shall be
destroyed within 90 days of the incident, unless such tape is requested to be preserved
as part of a personnel complaint, civil or criminal investigation or case.
(b) Whenever possible, the videotaping will occur in a manner-that minimizes interference
with people lawfully participating in First Amendment activity. Individuals shall not
be singled out for videotaping or photographing because of their religious or political
views.
429.7 DEMONSTRATIONS
The Police Department will not investigate or gather intelligence of a planned demonstration
from non-open sources, unless there is reasonable suspicion that the demonstration will result
in criminal activity rising to acts of violence, destruction of property or a threat to public safety.
The anticipation of acts of non-violent civil disobedience alone, without an accompanying threat to
public safety, shall not be a basis to investigate or gather intelligence of a planned demonstration,
other than from open sources for purposes such as estimating the time, size and route of the
demonstration.

Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities
429.8 INTELLIGENCE FILES
The creation of intelligence files when investigating individuals and groups involved in First
Amendment protected activities where a criminal predicate, exists shall meet the below criteria.
(a) An intelligence file will consist of analyzed data from sources ranging from "open
source" to "confidential" (such as informants and classified reports). The only limits
Title 28 CFR 23 places on data that may be analyzed are:
1. It must be legally obtained
2. It may not include information about political, religious or social views,
associations or activities unless such information is related to definable criminal
conduct or activity and the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of
involvement in that conduct or activity.
3. It is within the California Attorney General Guidelines.
(b) Once data has been lawfully collected, it goes through several steps that will terminate
in one of three results:
1. Destruction of the data because there is no criminal predicate and no reasonable
likelihood of developing a criminal predicate;
2. Determination that, although no criminal predicate then exists or no person or
group has yet been linked to the predicate, there is a reasonable likelihood that
– within a reasonable time (the Department of Justice uses one year) evidence
of the predicate or identity of the person or group will be available; or
3. Retention of the data based on a criminal predicate.
(c) An intelligence file shall not be opened for reasonable suspicion of non-violent civil
disobedience that is only a misdemeanor and does not pose a threat to public safety.
429.8.1 INFORMATION ACCESS AND DISSEMINATION
Information Access and Dissemination: Those personnel authorized to access and disseminate
criminal intelligence file information shall ensure that prior to disseminating or allowing access to
criminal intelligence file information that the requestor has:
(a) The Right to Know: Requester has the right to obtain intelligence information because
of his or her status (e.g., a sworn member of a law enforcement agency) or pursuant
to a court order, statute or case law, and
(b) The Need to Know: Requester has an articulated need to obtain specific intelligence
information in order to execute official law enforcement responsibilities or because the
court order, statute or case law establishes such a need to know.
Access should never be granted when a requester has satisfied only one of these criteria.
429.9 AUDIT AND REPORTING
On an annual basis, the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, shall review the Department’s
files, records and documents to determine whether the Department is in compliance with these
regulations. The Chief of Police shall prepare a confidential summary report to the City Manager
regarding all investigations conducted by the Police Department pursuant to this policy.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Intelligence Procedures for First Amendment Activities
The Chief of Police, or his/her designee, shall prepare a statistical report annually for the Police
Review Commission that will include the following information:
(a) The number of investigations authorized during the prior year;
(b) The number of authorizations sought but denied;
(c) The number of times that undercover officers were used;
(d) The number of unlawful activities investigated;
(e) Arrest and violation information for completed investigations; and
(f) The number of requests for information from outside agencies for information relating
to investigations conducted pursuant to this policy.
429.9 AUTHORIZATION
When possible, in all cases involving an investigation into individuals or groups exercising
Constitutionally protected First Amendment activities, approval will be obtained from the Chief
of Police, or in his/her absence a division captain, prior to the initiation of an investigation. An
approval period will last for 90 days. Any investigation that continues for more than 90 days must
receive approvals from the Chief of Police at every 90-day interval.
(a) If it is impractical to obtain prior approval, the Chief of Police shall be notified in a timely
manner. Investigations shall only be initiated, where there is reasonable suspicion of
planned, on-going, or prior criminal activity.
(b) The Chief of Police will notify the City Manager of all investigations that are covered
by this policy.
429.10 OUTSIDE AGENCIES
The Berkeley Police Department will only cooperate with outside agencies consistent with this
policy, the California Attorney General's Criminal Intelligence Guidelines and Title 28 Code
of Federal Regulations, Part 23. Officers will follow this policy at all times when engaged in
cooperative efforts with another agency.

Law Enforcement Manual
Civil Disputes
430.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides members of the Berkeley Police Department with guidance for addressing
conflicts between persons when no criminal investigation or enforcement action is warranted (e.g.,
civil matters), with the goal of minimizing any potential for violence or criminal acts.
The Domestic Violence Policy will address specific legal mandates related to domestic violence
court orders. References in this policy to “court orders” apply to any order of a court that does not
require arrest or enforcement by the terms of the order or by California law.
430.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes that a law enforcement presence at a civil dispute
can play an important role in the peace and safety of the community. Subject to available
resources, members of this department will assist at the scene of civil disputes with the primary
goal of safeguarding persons and property, preventing criminal activity and maintaining the peace.
When handling civil disputes, members will remain impartial, maintain a calm presence, give
consideration to all sides and refrain from giving legal or inappropriate advice.
430.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
When appropriate, members handling a civil dispute should encourage the involved parties to
seek the assistance of resolution services or take the matter to the civil courts. Members must not
become personally involved in disputes and shall at all times remain impartial.
While not intended to be an exhaustive list, members should give considerations to the following
when handling civil disputes:
(a) Civil disputes tend to be confrontational and members should be alert that they can
escalate to violence very quickly. De-escalation techniques should be used when
appropriate.
(b) Members should not dismiss alleged or observed criminal violations as a civil matter
and should initiate the appropriate investigation and report when criminal activity is
apparent.
(c) Members shall not provide legal advice, however, when appropriate, members should
inform the parties when they are at risk of violating criminal laws.
(d) Members are reminded that they shall not enter a residence or other non-public
location without legal authority including valid consent.
(e) Members should not take an unreasonable amount of time assisting in these matters
and generally should contact a supervisor if it appears that peacekeeping efforts longer
than 30 minutes are warranted.
430.4 COURT ORDERS
Disputes involving court orders can be complex. Where no mandate exists for an officer to make an
arrest for a violation of a court order, the matter should be addressed by documenting any apparent
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Civil Disputes - 434
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Civil Disputes
court order violation in a report. If there appears to be a more immediate need for enforcement
action, the investigating officer should consult a supervisor prior to making any arrest.
If a person appears to be violating the terms of a court order but is disputing the validity of the
order or its applicability, the investigating officer should document the following:
(a) The person’s knowledge of the court order or whether proof of service exists.
(b) Any specific reason or rationale the involved person offers for not complying with the
terms of the order.
A copy of the court order should be attached to the report when available. The report should be
forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor. The report should also be forwarded to the court issuing
the order with a notice that the report was also forwarded to the prosecutor for review.
430.4.1 STANDBY REQUESTS
Officer responding to a call for standby assistance to retrieve property should meet the person
requesting assistance at a neutral location to discuss the process. The person should be advised
that items that are disputed will not be allowed to be removed. The member may advise the person
to seek private legal advice as to the distribution of disputed property.
Members should accompany the person to the location of the property. Members should ask if the
other party will allow removal of the property or whether the other party would remove the property.
If the other party is uncooperative, the person requesting standby assistance should be instructed
to seek private legal advice and obtain a court order to obtain the items. Officers should not order
the other party to allow entry or the removal of any items. If there is a restraining or similar order
against the person requesting standby assistance, that person should be asked to leave the scene
or they may be subject to arrest for violation of the order.
If the other party is not present at the location, the member will not allow entry into the location
or the removal of property from the location.
430.5 VEHICLES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY
Officers may be faced with disputes regarding possession or ownership of vehicles or other
personal property. Officers may review documents provided by parties or available databases
(e.g., vehicle registration), but should be aware that legal possession of vehicles or personal
property can be complex. Generally, officers should not take any enforcement action unless a
crime is apparent. The people and the vehicle or personal property involved should be identified
and the incident documented.
430.6 REAL PROPERTY
Disputes over possession or occupancy of real property (e.g., land, homes, apartments) should
generally be handled through a person seeking a court order.

Medical Aid and Response
431.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy recognizes that members often encounter persons in need of medical aid and
establishes a law enforcement response to such situations.
431.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department that all officers and other designated members
be trained to the level required by law to provide emergency medical aid and to facilitate an
emergency medical response.
431.3 FIRST RESPONDING MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
Whenever practicable, members should take appropriate steps to provide initial medical aid (e.g.,
first aid, CPR, use of an automated external defibrillator (AED)) in accordance with their training
and current certification levels. This should be done for those in need of immediate care and only
when the member can safely do so.

431.4 TRANSPORTING ILL AND INJURED PERSONS
Except in extraordinary cases where alternatives are not reasonably available, members should
not transport persons who are unconscious, who have serious injuries or who may be seriously
ill. EMS personnel should be called to handle patient transportation.
Officers should search any person who is in custody before releasing that person to EMS for
transport.
An officer should accompany any person in custody during transport in an ambulance when
requested by EMS personnel, when it reasonably appears necessary to provide security, when it
is necessary for investigative purposes or when so directed by a supervisor.
Members should not provide emergency escort for medical transport or civilian vehicles.
431.5 PERSONS REFUSING EMS CARE
If a person who is not in custody refuses EMS care or refuses to be transported to a medical
facility, an officer shall not force that person to receive care or be transported. However, members
may assist EMS personnel when EMS personnel determine the person lacks mental capacity to
understand the consequences of refusing medical care or to make an informed decision and the
lack of immediate medical attention may result in serious bodily injury or the death of the person.
In cases where mental illness may be a factor, the officer should consider proceeding with a 72-
hour treatment and evaluation commitment (5150 commitment) process in accordance with the
Mental Illness Commitments Policy.
If an officer believes that a person who is in custody requires EMS care and the person refuses,
he/she should encourage the person to receive medical treatment. The officer may also consider
contacting a family member to help persuade the person to agree to treatment or who may be
able to authorize treatment for the person.
If the person who is in custody still refuses, the officer will require the person to be transported
to the nearest medical facility. In such cases, the officer should consult with a supervisor prior
to the transport.
Members shall not sign refusal-for-treatment forms or forms accepting financial responsibility for
treatment.
431.6 MEDICAL ATTENTION RELATED TO USE OF FORCE
Specific guidelines for medical attention for injuries sustained from a use of force may be found in
the Use of Force, Handcuffing and Restraints, Control Devices and Techniques, and Conducted
Energy Device policies.
431.7 AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED) USE
A member may use an AED only after receiving appropriate training from an approved public
safety first aid and CPR course (22 CCR 100014; 22 CCR 100017; 22 CCR 100018).

shall be made available for inspection by the local EMS agency (LEMSA) or EMS authority upon
request (22 CCR 100021; 22 CCR 100022; 22 CCR 100029).
431.8 OPIOID OVERDOSE MEDICATION
See the Use of Narcan (Naloxone) Policy.
431.9 SICK OR INJURED ARRESTEE
If an arrestee appears ill or injured, or claims illness or injury, he/she should be medically cleared
prior to booking. If the officer has reason to believe the arrestee is feigning injury or illness, the
officer should contact a supervisor, who will determine whether medical clearance will be obtained
prior to booking.
If the jail or detention facility refuses to accept custody of an arrestee based on medical screening,
the officer should note the name of the facility person refusing to accept custody and the reason
for refusal, and should notify a supervisor to determine the appropriate action.
Arrestees who appear to have a serious medical issue should be transported by ambulance.
Officers shall not transport an arrestee to a hospital without a supervisor’s approval.
Nothing in this section should delay an officer from requesting EMS when an arrestee reasonably
appears to be exhibiting symptoms that appear to be life threatening, including breathing problems
or an altered level of consciousness, or is claiming an illness or injury that reasonably warrants
an EMS response in accordance with the officer’s training.
431.10 FIRST AID TRAINING
The Personnel and Training Sergeant should ensure officers receive initial first aid training within
one year of employment and refresher training every two years thereafter (22 CCR 100016; 22
CCR 100022).

Materials/ Acquisition/ Storage Acquisition and/or storage of unusual
quantities of materials such as cell phones,
pagers, radio control toy servos or controllers;
fuel, chemicals, or toxic materials; and timers
or other triggering devices in a manner that
would arouse suspicion of terrorism or other
criminality in a reasonable person.
Acquisition of Expertise Attempts to obtain or conduct training or
otherwise obtain knowledge or skills in security
concepts, military weapons or tactics, or
other unusual capabilities in a manner that
would arouse suspicion of terrorism or other
criminality in a reasonable person.
Weapons Collection or Discovery Collection or discovery of unusual amounts
or types of weapons, including explosives,

or evidence, detonations or other residue,
wounds, or chemical burns, that would arouse
suspicion of terrorism or other criminality in a
reasonable person.
Sector Specific Incident Actions associated with a characteristic of
unique concern to specific sectors (e.g. the
public health sector), with regard to their
personnel, facilities, systems, or functions
in a manner that would arouse suspicion of
terrorism or other criminality in a reasonable
person.
Note: These activities are not inherently criminal behaviors and may include constitutionally
protected activities that must not be documented in an ISE-SAR that contains PII unless there
are articulable facts or circumstances that clearly support the determination that the behavior
observed is not innocent, but rather reasonably indicative of pre-operational planning associated
with terrorism. Race, ethnicity, gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or gender
identity must not be considered as factors creating suspicion (but attributes may be documented in
specific suspect descriptions for identification purposes). The activities listed as "Potential Criminal
or Non-Criminal Activity" are not inherently criminal behaviors and are potentially constitutionally
protected; thus, additional facts or circumstances must be articulated in the incident.
432.11 EXAMPLES OF BEHAVIOR WHICH CANNOT BE REPORTED AS SAR
Non-violent civil disobedience is specifically exempted from SARs reporting, and such activities
shall not be reported as SARs.

Suspicious Activity Reporting
SARs must not be submitted based on ideology, social or political opinion or advocacy of religious
beliefs or association with a particular group. Criminal activity that would not ordinarily result in
a SAR does not become worthy of a SAR when the subject's speech or expression indicates a
particular ideological viewpoint or association.
*Unless:1) the activity rises to the level of criminal conduct, or 2) the person taking part in the
activity is not identified, and therefore, not subject to possible investigation by state and federal
investigative agencies.

a client may stay for 24 hours, and a detoxification center where a 3 to 5 day program.
The detoxification center is designed to provide detoxification, preventative, educational and
therapeutic services to individuals in a monitored residential setting. Clients engaged by Cherry
Hill Detox staff are those who are assessed as not requiring medication for the management of
withdrawal. It is operated by Horizon Services, Inc., a non-profit community based organization
with over 30 years of service to the Bay Area, and a commitment to reducing alcohol and drug
related problems in the community. Cherry Hill Detox accepts clients by referral only.
The facilities are located at Alameda County Hospital's Fairmont Campus, 15480 Foohill Blvd.,
San Leandro. Posted signage will direct officers to the appropriate place once they've entered
the Campus grounds.
440.4 CHERRY HILL SOBERING CENTER REFERRAL PROCEDURES
When evaluating whether or not an intoxicated person should be referred to the Sobering Center, it
is important to understand who is acceptable. According to protocols established by the Sobering
Center, the eligibility requirements for client referral are:
(a) Client must be 18 years of age or older.
(b) Client must not have any obvious reason to be transported to the hospital.
(c) Client must be ambulatory with assistance.

Sobering and Detoxification Center
(a) Confirm there is space available at the Center; and,
(b) Advise the staff of the estimated transportation time to the Center.
It is important to note that though the person may be cooperative and their participation voluntary,
they are still considered detained during transportation to the Sobering Center. To that end, a
lawful safety-related pat search of the person for weapons should be accomplished on-scene,
and appropriate restraint devices (e.g., handcuffs, seat belt, etc) should be employed to ensure
safe transportation.
Upon arrival at the Sobering Center, the officer(s) will be asked to stand by as a staff Health
Technician or nurse conducts a triage screening of the client for any medical condition that would
preclude him/her from entering the facility. The following are among the medical issues being
evaluated by Center staff:

440.5 CHERRY HILL DETOXIFICATION PROGRAM REFERRAL PROCEDURES
There may be an occasion where an officer engages an adult alcohol/drug abuser who wants
to participate in a detoxification program. If so, the officer may facilitate the person's referral to
Cherry Hill Detox. The first step of referral is a call to the program's reception staff (866-866-7496),
who will ask triage questions to determine the acceptability of the person to the program:
(a) What substances is the person detoxing from?
(b) Is/was the person an IV drug user?
(c) Does the person have any physical problems that would require medical treatment?
(d) Is the person under the care of a physician or psychiatrist?
(e) Is the person taking prescription medication? If so, what?
(f) If female, is the person pregnant?
Whenever practical, the person seeking referral should talk directly to the Detox Program staff
member conducting the telephone screening. If necessary to facilitate this triage process, the
officer may ask the person the above questions as part of their conversation about the referral,

and share his/her responses with the staff member. With respect for the person's privacy, specific
questions about a person's medical condition(s) should be avoided.
Subsequent to telephone screening, the Detox Program staff member will advise if the person
is acceptable for referral. If so, the officer may provide the person transportation to the Detox
Program facility. Unlike the Sobering Center, and in order to protect patient confidentiality, the
transporting officer(s) will not be required to standby for or participate in the Program's intake
process.

Law Enforcement Manual
Traffic Function and Responsibility
500.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The ultimate goal of traffic law enforcement is to reduce traffic collisions. This may be achieved
through the application of such techniques as geographic/temporal assignment of personnel and
equipment and the establishment of preventive patrols to deal with specific categories of unlawful
driving behavior. Traffic enforcement techniques are based on collision data, enforcement activity
records, traffic volume, and traffic conditions. This department provides enforcement efforts
toward violations, not only in proportion to the frequency of their occurrence in collision situations,
but also in terms of traffic-related needs.
500.2 TRAFFIC OFFICER DEPLOYMENT
Several factors are considered in the development of deployment schedules for officers of the
Berkeley Police Department. Information provided by the California Statewide Integrated Traffic
Reporting System (SWITRS) is a valuable resource for traffic collision occurrences and therefore
officer deployment. Some of the factors for analysis include:
• Location
• Time
• Day
• Violation factors
• Resident requests/concerns
Officers assigned to patrol or traffic enforcement functions may conduct enforcement of collision
causing violations during high collision hours and at locations of occurrence. Officers may take
directed enforcement action on request, and random enforcement action when appropriate against
violators as a matter of routine. Officers shall maintain high visibility while working general
enforcement, especially at high collision locations.
Other factors to be considered for deployment are requests from the public, construction zones
or special events.
500.3 ENFORCEMENT
Enforcement actions are commensurate with applicable laws and take into account the degree
and severity of the violation committed. This department does not establish ticket quotas and
the number of arrests or citations issued by any officer shall not be used as the sole criterion
for evaluating officer overall performance (Vehicle Code § 41603). The visibility and quality of an
officer’s work effort will be commensurate with the philosophy of this policy. Several methods are
effective in the reduction of collisions:
500.3.1 WARNINGS
Warnings or other non-punitive enforcement actions may be considered.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Traffic Function and Responsibility
500.3.2 CITATIONS
Citations may be issued when an officer believes it is appropriate. It is essential that officers fully
explain the rights and requirements imposed on motorists upon issuance of a citation for a traffic
violation. Officers should provide the following information at a minimum:
(a) Explanation of the violation or charge
(b) Court appearance procedure including the optional or mandatory appearance by the
motorist
500.3.3 PHYSICAL ARREST
Physical arrest can be made on a number of criminal traffic offenses outlined in the Vehicle Code
or Penal Code. These physical arrest cases usually deal with, but are not limited to:
(a) Vehicular manslaughter
(b) Felony and misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs
(c) Felony or misdemeanor hit-and-run
(d) Refusal to sign notice to appear
(e) Any other misdemeanor at the discretion of the officer, such as reckless driving with
extenuating circumstances
500.4 SUSPENDED OR REVOKED DRIVERS LICENSES
If an officer contacts a traffic violator for driving on a suspended or revoked license, the officer
may issue a traffic citation pursuant to Vehicle Code § 14601.
If a computer check of a traffic violator's license status reveals a suspended or revoked driver
license and the traffic violator still has his or her license in possession, the license shall be seized
by the officer. The officer shall verbally advise the traffic violator of the suspension or revocation
and issue the citation. The officer will be responsible for filling out the Verbal Notice form (DMV
form DL-310) and causing that form and license to be forwarded to the Department of Motor
Vehicles.
500.5 HIGH-VISIBILITY VESTS
The Department has provided American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Class II high-visibility
vests to increase the visibility of department members who may be exposed to hazards presented
by passing traffic, maneuvering or operating vehicles, machinery and equipment (23 CFR 655.601;
8 CCR 1598).
Although intended primarily for use while performing traffic related assignments, high-visibility
vests should be worn at any time increased visibility would improve the safety or efficiency of the
member.
500.5.1 REQUIRED USE
Except when working in a potentially adversarial or confrontational role, such as during vehicle
stops, high-visibility vests should be worn at any time it is anticipated that an employee will be

Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Traffic Function and Responsibility
exposed to the hazards of approaching traffic or construction and recovery equipment. Examples
of when high-visibility vests should be worn include traffic control duties, collision investigations,
lane closures and while at disaster scenes, or anytime high visibility is desirable. When emergency
conditions preclude the immediate donning of the vest, officers should retrieve and wear the vest
as soon as conditions reasonably permit. Use of the vests shall also be mandatory when directed
by a supervisor.
Vests maintained in the investigation units may be used any time a plainclothes officer might
benefit from being readily identified as a member of law enforcement.
500.5.2 CARE AND STORAGE OF HIGH-VISIBILITY VESTS
A supply of high-visibility vests will be maintained in the equipment room for replacement of
damaged or unserviceable vests. The Personnel and Training Sergeant should be promptly
notified whenever the supply of vests in the equipment room needs replenishing.

Motor Vehicle Collision Investigations
501.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to establish procedures and guidelines for the investigation of traffic
collisions and traffic related incidents, along with the preparation and handling of related reports.
501.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department that all hit and run collisions with investigative
leads and collisions with injuries will be fully investigated to determine the causative factors and
responsibility for the collision. Documentation shall conform to State and Department reporting
requirements.
501.3 GENERAL
The Department is governed in the classification of motor vehicle collisions by the California
Highway Patrol (CHP) Collision Investigation Manual.
Traffic collision investigations shall be conducted with the objective of prosecution of violation(s)
that caused the collision. Traffic collision investigative reports should clearly define the violation(s)
and contain all information necessary for a successful prosecution.
(a) The completed investigative report may be viewed, or a copy purchased, at the front
counter of Records Management, located on the first floor of the Public Safety Building
(PSB), after approximately ten business days.
501.4 DUTIES OF THE DRIVER
501.4.1 SR-1 FORM
The California Vehicle Code requires any driver involved in a vehicle collision in California to report
the collision (via SR-1 form) to the DMV within 10 days if:
(a) There was property damage of more than $1,000, or
(b) Anyone was injured (no matter how minor) or
(c) Anyone was killed.
Each driver must make a report whether they caused the collision or not and even if the collision
occurred on private property. The report is the responsibility of the driver, regardless of whether or
not a police report was taken. An insurance agent, attorney or another designated representative
may file the report for the driver. The SR-1 form is available at the front counter of the PSB or on
the DMV's website for download.
501.4.2 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
Vehicle Code § 16025 states, “Every driver involved in the collision shall, unless rendered
incapable, exchange with any other driver or property owner involved in the collision and present
at the scene, all of the following information:

502.13 DRIVING A NON-CITY VEHICLE
Vehicles which have been towed by or at the direction of the Department should not be driven by
police personnel unless it is necessary to move a vehicle a short distance to eliminate a hazard,
prevent the obstruction of a fire hydrant or to comply with posted signs.
502.14 NOTIFICATIONS
Within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, of the storage of any such vehicle it shall be

502.15 TOWING SERVICES
The City of Berkeley's current tow contracts provide guidelines for prompt and safe towing services
under the Berkeley Police Department's Rotation Tow Program. Towing services will be used in
the following situations:
(a) When it is necessary to safeguard a vehicle due to the inability of the owner or operator
to take the required action.
(b) When a vehicle is being held as evidence in connection with an investigation.
(c) When it is otherwise necessary to store a motor vehicle. This would include situations
involving the recovery of stolen or abandoned vehicles, and the removal of vehicles
obstructing traffic in violation of state or local regulations.
502.16 VEHICLE INVENTORY
All property in a stored or impounded vehicle shall be inventoried and listed on the vehicle storage
report. This includes the trunk and any compartments or containers, even if closed and/or locked.
Members conducting inventory searches should be as thorough and accurate as practical in
preparing an itemized inventory. These inventory procedures are for the purpose of protecting an
owner's property while in police custody, to provide for the safety of officers, and to protect the
Department against fraudulent claims of lost, stolen, or damaged property.
502.17 SECURITY OF VEHICLES AND PROPERTY
Unless it would cause an unreasonable delay in the completion of a vehicle impound/storage or
create an issue of officer safety, officers should make reasonable accommodations to permit a
driver/owner to retrieve small items of value or personal need (e.g., cash, jewelry, cell phone,
prescriptions) that are not considered evidence or contraband.
If a search of a vehicle leaves the vehicle or any property contained therein vulnerable to
unauthorized entry, theft, or damage, personnel conducting the search shall take such steps as
are reasonably necessary to secure and/or preserve the vehicle or property from such hazards.
502.18 RELEASE OF VEHICLE
The Communication Center will maintain an up-to-date tow log and provide information regarding
the impoundment of vehicles and the right of the registered owner to request a storage hearing.
Releases for towed vehicles will be made available during regular, non-emergency business hours
(Vehicle Code § 14602.6). After normal business hours:
(a) Towed vehicles shall be released after proof of current registration is provided by the
owner or the person in control of the vehicle and after all applicable fees are paid
(Vehicle Code § 22850.3; Vehicle Code § 22850.5).
(b) Vehicles removed that require payment of parking fines or proof of valid driver’s license
(foreign or domestic) shall only be released upon presentation of proof of compliance,
proof of payment, completion of affidavit and payment of applicable fees related to the
removal (Vehicle Code § 22651 et seq., Vehicle Code § 22652 et seq., Vehicle Code
§ 22850.3; Vehicle Code § 22850.5).

Vehicle Towing and Release
(c) A vehicle removed pursuant to Vehicle Code § 14602.6(a) shall be released to the
registered owner or his/her agent with proof of current registration, proof of a valid
driver’s license (foreign or domestic) and applicable fees paid prior to the end of the
30-day impoundment period under any of the following circumstances:
(a) The vehicle was stolen.
(b) If the driver reinstates his/her driver's license or acquires a license and provides
proof of proper insurance.
(c) Any other circumstance as set forth in Vehicle Code § 14602.6.
(d) When there is no remaining community caretaking need to continue impound
of the vehicle or the continued impound would not otherwise comply with the
Fourth Amendment.
(d) An autonomous vehicle removed under authority of Vehicle Code § 22651(o)(1)(D)
shall be released to the registered owner or person in control of the autonomous
vehicle if the requirements of Vehicle Code § 22651(o)(3)(B) are met.
(e) A vehicle removed pursuant to an investigation with a "hold" on it, may not be released
until the hold has been rescinded.
Personnel whose duties include releasing towed vehicles should consult the Vehicle Code under
which the vehicle was towed or impounded for any specific requirements prior to release.
Any sworn employee who suspects that a vehicle was impounded in error should promptly advise a
supervisor. On-duty supervisors should approve, when appropriate and without delay, the release
of the vehicle without requiring the registered owner or his/her agent to request a hearing, as
described in the Vehicle Impound Hearings Policy.
Written authorization received from an owner's agent and a copy of the agent's proof of identity
shall be attached to the original vehicle release form and routed to Records management for
incorporation into the report file.
502.19 TOW PROGRAM MONITORING
The Traffic Bureau will regularly monitor vehicle tows accomplished pursuant to this policy, as
represented in tow reports, to ensure adherence to established policy and procedure.
The Traffic Bureau will be responsible for the periodic review of this policy and related tow program
to assess the currency, applicability and effectiveness of related policy and procedure, and any
identifiable impacts this Department’s tow program has on traffic safety.
502.20 LEGAL GUIDANCE CONCERNING "COMMUNITY CARETAKING"
In 2019, the California Legislature amended Vehicle Code section 22650 to require that any
removal of a vehicle must be to achieve a "community caretaking" need. It is no longer sufficient
that one of the circumstances set forth in Vehicle Code section 22651 is present. There also must
be a justification based on community caretaking, such as the need to ensure the safe flow of
traffic or to protect property from theft or vandalism.

Vehicle Towing and Release
502.20.1 VEHICLE CODE SECTION 22650(B)
A removal pursuant to an authority, including, but not limited to, as provided in Section 22651,
that is based on community caretaking, is only reasonable if the removal is necessary to achieve
the community caretaking need, such as ensuring the safe flow of traffic or protecting property
from theft or vandalism.
Reasons for towing that have been found to be community caretaking functions"
• Expired registration (6 months or more)
• Lack of license plates or other evidence of registration
• Inoperable vehicles. Specifically:
o Vehicles which "lack an engine, transmission, wheels, tires, doors, windshield,
or any other part or equipment necessary to operate safely on the highways of
this state" VC 22669(d)
o Vehicles which are "abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative" and
parked on private or public property, per VC 22660-22668 and BMC 12.98
• Unlicensed driver, the likelihood that the unlicensed driver would return to drive the
vehicle home.
o However impound has been found impermissible (1) when parked in the driver's
driveway, (2) when parked legally two houses away from teh driver's home.
o Continued impoundment is illegal when a licensed driver (even someone other
that the owner) is available to take possession
• Vehicle is creating a traffic hazard
o e.g. impeding traffic or blocking driveway
• Vehicle is creating another safety hazard
o e.g. broken glass, public nuisance conditions.
• Tow is needed to protect the vehicle from vandalism or theft
o e.g. if arrestee's vehicle is left on private parking lot, vehicle unattended on road
where theft/vandalism is common
o This generally should not be used as a basis to tow a vehicle which is used
as shelter, since it is more regularly occupied in that case, especially at night
when vandalism or theft are more likely to take place, thereby deterring such
crime. Moreover, towing an unhoused person's vehicle to avoid vandalism or
theft would likely have the effect of causing a greater loss to the inhabitant, who
may not be able to retrieve their vehicle from impound.

Law Enforcement Manual
Tow Hearings
503.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes a procedure for the requirement to provide vehicle storage or impound
hearings pursuant to Vehicle Code § 22852.
503.2 STORED OR IMPOUND HEARING
When a vehicle is stored or impounded by any member of the Berkeley Police Department, a
hearing will be conducted upon the request of the registered or legal owner of the vehicle or his/
her agent (Vehicle Code § 22650(a); Vehicle Code § 22852(a)).
The hearing shall be conducted within 48 hours of the request, excluding weekends and holidays.
The hearing officer must be a person other than the person who directed the storage or impound
of the vehicle (Vehicle Code § 22852(c)).
503.3 HEARING PROCEDURES
The vehicle storage hearing is an informal process to evaluate the validity of an order to store
or impound a vehicle. The employee who caused the storage or removal of the vehicle does not
need to be present for this hearing.
All requests for a hearing on a stored or impounded vehicle shall be submitted in person, in writing
or by telephone within 10 days of the date appearing on the notice (Vehicle Code § 22852(b)).
The Traffic Bureau Lieutenant, or his/her designee, will generally serve as the hearing officer. The
person requesting the hearing may record the hearing at his/her own expense.
The failure of either the registered or legal owner or interested person or his/her agent to request
a hearing in a timely manner or to attend a scheduled hearing shall be considered a waiver of
and satisfaction of the post-storage hearing requirement (Vehicle Code § 22851.3(e)(2); Vehicle
Code § 22852(d)). In addition, if the person requesting the hearing or his/her agent is 30 or more
minutes late for their scheduled hearing, the statutory requirement for a hearing will be considered
satisfied.
503.4 EVIDENCE
Any relevant evidence may be submitted and reviewed by the hearing officer to determine if
reasonable grounds have been established for the storage or impound of the vehicle. The initial
burden of proof established by a preponderance of the evidence that the storage/impound was
based on probable cause rests with the Department.
After consideration of all information, the hearing officer shall determine the validity of the storage
or impound of the vehicle in question and then render a decision. The hearing officer shall also
consider any mitigating circumstances attendant to the storage that reasonably would warrant the
release of the vehicle or a modification or reduction of the period the vehicle is impounded (Vehicle
Code §14602.6(b); Vehicle Code § 14602.8(b)).
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Tow Hearings - 484
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Tow Hearings
Aside from those mitigating circumstances enumerated in the Vehicle Code, the registered
owner's lack of actual knowledge that the driver to whom the vehicle was loaned was not validly
licensed may constitute a mitigating circumstance under Vehicle Code § 14602.6(b) or 14602.8(b),
warranting release of the vehicle. This mitigating circumstance exception is not limited to situations
where the owner made a reasonable inquiry as to the licensed status of the driver before lending
the vehicle.
503.5 DECISION
The legislative intent and this department’s policy is to prevent unlicensed driving pursuant to
Vehicle Code §14602.6. If this purpose is not furthered by the continued impoundment of a vehicle,
release is most often appropriate.
(a) If a decision is made that reasonable grounds for storage or impound have been
established, the hearing officer shall advise the inquiring party of the decision and that
the inquiring party may pursue further civil remedies if desired.
(b) If a decision is made that reasonable grounds for storage or impound have not been
established or sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, the vehicle in storage shall
be released immediately. Towing and storage fees will be paid at the Department’s
expense (Vehicle Code § 22852(e)).
503.6 HEARING EXCEPTIONS
The right to a post-storage hearing applies to all tows except:
(a) Vehicles impounded for investigation of a hit-and-run collision pursuant to Vehicle
Code § 22655;
(b) Vehicles removed from private property pursuant to Vehicle Code § 22658;
(c) Abandoned or hazardous vehicles removed pursuant to Vehicle Code § 22669
determined to have an estimated value of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less; and,
(d) Vehicles or vehicle parts removed from private property by authority of a City or County
ordinance pursuant to Vehicle Code §§ 22660 to 22668, inclusive, and § 22710.

Law Enforcement Manual
Impaired Driving
504.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidance to those department members who play a role in the detection and
investigation of driving under the influence (DUI).
504.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to the safety of the roadways and the community
and will pursue fair but aggressive enforcement of California’s impaired driving laws.
504.3 INVESTIGATIONS
All officers are expected to enforce DUI laws with due diligence. Vehicle Codes §§ 23152 and
23153 prohibit the operation of a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, which includes
alcohol, drugs or a combination of both, without restriction to a particular venue. Therefore a
related arrest may be made on public or private property.
The Traffic Bureau Lieutenant, or his/her designee, should develop and maintain, in consultation
with the prosecuting attorney, report forms with appropriate checklists to assist investigating
officers in documenting relevant information and maximizing efficiency. Any DUI investigation will
be documented using these forms. Information documented elsewhere on the form does not need
to be duplicated in the report narrative. Information that should be documented includes, at a
minimum:
(a) The field sobriety tests (FSTs) administered and the results.
(b) The officer’s observations that indicate impairment on the part of the individual, and the
officer’s health-related inquiries that may help to identify any serious health concerns
(e.g., diabetic shock).
(c) Sources of additional information (e.g., reporting party, witnesses) and their
observations.
(d) Information about any audio and/or video recording of the individual’s driving or
subsequent actions.
(e) The location and time frame of the individual’s vehicle operation and how this was
determined.
(f) Any prior related convictions in California or another jurisdiction.
504.4 FIELD TESTS
Officers should use the standardized FSTs as outlined by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) and any approved alternate tests for officers to use when investigating
violations of DUI laws.
504.5 PRELIMINARY ALCOHOL SCREENING
Officers may use a preliminary alcohol screening (PAS) test to assist in establishing reasonable
cause to believe a person is DUI. The officer shall advise the person that the PAS test is being
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Impaired Driving - 486
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Impaired Driving
requested to assist in determining whether the person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs,
or a combination of the two. Unless the person is under the age of 21, he/she shall be advised
that the PAS test is voluntary. The officer shall also advise the person that submitting to a PAS
test does not satisfy his/her obligation to submit to a chemical test as otherwise required by law
(Vehicle Code § 23612).
504.6 PRELIMINARY ALCOHOL SCREENING FOR A PERSON UNDER AGE 21
If an officer lawfully detains a person under 21 years of age who is driving a motor vehicle and
the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person has a blood alcohol content of 0.01
or more, the officer shall request that the person take a PAS test to determine the presence of
alcohol in the person, if a PAS test device is immediately available. If a PAS test device is not
immediately available, the officer may request the person to submit to chemical testing of his/her
blood, breath or urine, conducted pursuant to Vehicle Code § 23612 (Vehicle Code § 13388).
If the person refuses to take or fails to complete the PAS test or other chemical test, or if the result
of either test reveals a blood alcohol content of 0.01 or more, the officer shall proceed to serve
the person with a notice of order of suspension pursuant to this policy (Vehicle Code § 13388).
504.7 CHEMICAL TESTS
A person implies consent to a chemical test or tests, and to providing the associated chemical
sample, under any of the following (Vehicle Code § 23612):
(a) The person is arrested for driving a vehicle while under the influence, pursuant to
Vehicle Code § 23152.
(b) The person is under 21 years of age and is arrested by an officer having reasonable
cause to believe that the person’s blood alcohol content is 0.05 or more (Vehicle Code
§ 23140).
(c) The person is under 21 years of age and detained by an officer having reasonable
cause to believe that the person was driving a vehicle while having a blood alcohol
content of 0.01 or more (Vehicle Code § 23136).
(d) The person was operating a vehicle while under the influence and proximately caused
bodily injury to another person (Vehicle Code § 23153).
If a person withdraws this implied consent, or is unable to withdraw consent (e.g., the person is
unconscious), the officermay consider implied consent revoked and proceed as though the person
has refused to provide a chemical sample.
504.8 CHOICE OF TESTS
Officers shall respect a viable choice of chemical test made by an arrestee, as provided for by law
(e.g., breath will not be acceptable for suspected narcotics influence).
A person arrested for DUI has the choice of whether the test is of his/her blood or breath, and
the officer shall advise the person that he/she has that choice. If the person arrested either is
incapable, or states that he/she is incapable, of completing the chosen test, the person shall submit
to the remaining test.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Impaired Driving - 487
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Impaired Driving
If the person chooses to submit to a breath test and there is reasonable cause to believe that
the person is under the influence of a drug or the combined influence of alcohol and any drug,
the officer may also request that the person submit to a blood test. If the person is incapable of
completing a blood test, the person shall submit to and complete a urine test (Vehicle Code §
23612(a)(2)(C)).
The officer must have reasonable suspicion and give clear indication that a blood or urine test
will reveal evidence of the person being under the influence and state in his or her report the
facts upon which that belief and clear indication are based. Once the breath test is completed, the
officer should read the drug admonition listed in the Admin Per Se DMV form. If the person refuses
to provide the additional sample after the breath test is completed this shall be documented as
a refusal.
If a DUI driver is involved in a traffic collision in which serious injury was inflicted, such as broken
bones, serious bleeding, etc., there should be no question or choice. The DUI driver will be required
to submit to a blood test unless he/she is a hemophiliac or a person with a heart condition.
504.9 BREATH SAMPLES
The Traffic Bureau Lieutenant, or his/her designee, should ensure that all devices used for the
collection and analysis of breath samples are properly serviced and tested, and that a record of
such service and testing is properly maintained. Breath tests may only be administered by a Peace
Officer Standards and Training (POST) certified and properly trained technician.
Members obtaining a breath sample should monitor the device for any sign of malfunction. Any
anomalies or equipment failures should be noted in the appropriate report and promptly reported
to the Traffic Bureau Lieutenant or his/her designee.
When the arrested person chooses a breath test, the handling officer shall advise the person that
the breath-testing equipment does not retain a sample, and the person may, if desired, provide a
blood or urine specimen, which will be retained to facilitate subsequent verification testing (Vehicle
Code § 23614).
The officer should also require the person to submit to a blood test if the officer has a clear
indication that a blood test will reveal evidence of any drug or the combined influence of an
alcoholic beverage and any drug. Evidence of the officer’s belief shall be included in the officer’s
report (Vehicle Code § 23612(a)(2)(C)).
In cases where this tolerance is exceeded, additional tests of the driver’s breath shall be conducted
until the results of two analyses fall within the 0.02% BAC variance.
504.10 BLOOD SAMPLES
Only persons authorized by law to draw blood shall collect blood samples (Vehicle Code § 23158).
The blood draw should be witnessed by the assigned officer. No officer, even if properly certified,
should perform this task.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Impaired Driving - 488
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Impaired Driving
Officers should inform an arrestee that if he/she chooses to provide a blood sample, a separate
sample can be collected for alternate testing. Unless medical personnel object, two samples
should be collected and retained as evidence, so long as only one puncture is required.
The blood sample shall be packaged, marked, handled, stored and transported as required by
the testing facility.
If an arrestee cannot submit to a blood draw because he/she has a bleeding disorder or has taken
medication that inhibits coagulation, he/she shall not be required to take a blood test. Such inability
to take a blood test should not be considered a refusal. However, that arrestee may be required
to complete another available and viable test.
All DUI blood draws regardless if consent is given, shall obtain an approved search warrant
seeking blood for examination.
504.11 URINE SAMPLES
If a urine test will be performed, the arrestee should be promptly transported to the appropriate
testing site. The officer shall follow any directions accompanying the urine evidence collection kit.
Urine samples shall be collected and witnessed by an officer of the same sex as the individual
giving the sample. The arrestee should be allowed sufficient privacy to maintain his/her dignity, to
the extent possible, while still ensuring the accuracy of the sample (Vehicle Code § 23158(i)).
If the subject is unable to provide the sample, direct him/her to select either of the two remaining
tests (blood or breath). A refusal or failure to comply constitutes a refusal. Fill out the appropriate
chemical refusal form.
The sample shall be packaged, marked, handled, stored and transported as required by the testing
facility.
504.12 REFUSALS
When an arrestee refuses to provide a viable chemical sample, officers should:
(a) Advise the arrestee of the requirement to provide a sample (Vehicle Code § 23612).
The admonition is found on DMV form DS 367 (or DS 367M (for persons under 21
years old). The admonition must be read verbatim, and the subject’s response or
non-response recorded on the form. If a combination of both drugs and alcohol is
suspected, and the person chose a breath test, the Drug Admonition on the second
half of the said page shall be read.
(b) Audio- and/or video-record the admonishment when it is practicable.
(c) Document the refusal in the appropriate report.
504.12.1 STATUTORY NOTIFICATIONS UPON REFUSAL
Upon refusal to submit to a chemical test as required by law, officers shall personally serve the
notice of order of suspension upon the arrestee and take possession of any California state-issued
license to operate a motor vehicle that is held by that individual (Vehicle Code § 23612(e); Vehicle
Code § 23612(f)).

504.13 BLOOD SAMPLE WITHOUT CONSENT
A blood sample may be obtained from a person who refuses a chemical test when any of the
following conditions exist:
(a) A search warrant has been obtained (Penal Code § 1524).
(b) The officer can articulate that exigent circumstances exist. Exigency does not exist
solely because of the short time period associated with the natural dissipation of
alcohol or controlled or prohibited substances in the person’s bloodstream. Exigency
can be established by the existence of special facts such as a lengthy time delay in
obtaining a blood sample due to an accident investigation or medical treatment of the
person.
504.14 FORCED BLOOD SAMPLE
If an arrestee indicates by word or action that he/she will physically resist a blood draw, the officer
should request a supervisor to respond.
The responding supervisor should:
(a) Evaluate whether using force to obtain a blood sample is appropriate under the
circumstances.
(b) Ensure that all attempts to obtain a blood sample through force cease if the person
agrees to, and completes a viable form of testing in a timely manner.
(c) Advise the person of his/her duty to provide a sample (even if this advisement was
previously done by another officer) and attempt to persuade the individual to submit
to such a sample without physical resistance.
1. This dialogue should be recorded on audio and/or video if practicable.
(d) Ensure that the blood sample is taken in a medically approved manner.
(e) Ensure the forced blood draw is recorded on audio and/or video when practicable.
(f) Monitor and ensure that the type and level of force applied appears reasonable under
the circumstances:
(a) Unless otherwise provided in a warrant, force should generally be limited to
handcuffing or similar restraint methods.
(b) In all cases, force which reasonably appears necessary to overcome the
resistance to the blood draw may be permitted.
i. In extreme circumstances, officers may utilize the WRAP device pursuant
to the parameters set forth in Policy 302.11 Handcuffing and Restraints,
when other conventional methods of restraint have failed.
ii. Pursuant to Policy 300 Use of Force, all incidents of force shall be
appropriately reported and documented.
(g) Ensure the use of force and methods used to accomplish the collection of the blood
sample are documented in the related report.

existent administrative file, amendments, and/or testimonial material provided by the
appellant and may conduct further investigation or follow-up on their own.
3. Superior Court Review: If the appellant wishes to pursue the matter beyond an
administrative hearing, a Superior Court review may be presented in person by the
appellant after an application for review and designated filing fees have been paid to
the Superior Court of California.

An administrative review or administrative hearing will not be provided if the mandated time limits
are not adhered to by the violator.
1. Administrative Review: Requests for an administrative review must be postmarked
within 21 calendar days of issuance of the notice of parking violation, or within 14
calendar days of the mailing of the Notice of Delinquent Parking Violation (Vehicle
Code § 40215(a)).
2. Administrative Hearing: Requests for administrative hearings must be made no
later than 21 calendar days following the notification mailing of the results of the
administrative review (Vehicle Code § 40215(b)). An administrative hearing shall be

Disabled Vehicles
506.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Vehicle Code § 20018 provides that all law enforcement agencies having responsibility for traffic
enforcement may develop and adopt a written policy to provide assistance to motorists in disabled
vehicles within their primary jurisdiction.
506.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY
When an on-duty officer observes a disabled vehicle on the roadway, the officer should make a
reasonable effort to provide assistance. If that officer is assigned to a call of higher priority, the
dispatcher should be advised of the location of the disabled vehicle and the need for assistance.
The dispatcher should then assign another available officer to respond for assistance as soon
as practical.
506.3 EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE
In most cases, a disabled motorist will require assistance. After arrangements for assistance are
made, continued involvement by department personnel will be contingent on the time of day, the
location, the availability of departmental resources, and the vulnerability of the disabled motorist.
506.3.1 MECHANICAL REPAIRS
Department personnel shall not make mechanical repairs to a disabled vehicle. The use of push
bumpers to relocate vehicles to a position of safety is not considered a mechanical repair.
506.3.2 RELOCATION OF DISABLED VEHICLES
The relocation of disabled vehicles by members of this department should only occur when
the conditions reasonably indicate that immediate movement is necessary to reduce a hazard
presented by the disabled vehicle.
506.3.3 RELOCATION OF DISABLED MOTORIST
The relocation of a disabled motorist should only occur with the person’s consent and should be
suggested when conditions reasonably indicate that immediate movement is necessary to mitigate
a potential hazard. The department member may stay with the disabled motorist or transport him/
her to a safe area to await pickup.

72-Hour Parking Violations
507.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides procedures for the marking, recording, and storage of vehicles parked in
violation of the Berkeley Municipal Code regulating 72-hour parking violations and abandoned
vehicles under the authority of Vehicle Code § 22669.
507.2 RESPONSIBILITIES
Vehicles suspected of being in violation of the City of Berkeley 72-Hour Parking Ordinance or
Vehicle Code shall be logged into CAD and assigned to a Parking Enforcement Officer. This
does not prohibit a patrol officer from initiating or following up on an investigation of a suspected
violation.
507.3 VEHICLE STORAGE
Any vehicle in violation shall be stored by the authorized towing service and a vehicle storage
report (CHP 180 form) shall be completed by the officer authorizing the storage of the vehicle.
The storage report form shall be submitted to Records Management, and the small carbon copy
shall be submitted to the Communications Center mailbox, immediately following the storage of the
vehicle. It shall be the responsibility of the Communications Center to immediately notify the Stolen
Vehicle System (SVS) of the Department of Justice in Sacramento ( Vehicle Code § 22851.3(b)).
Notification may also be made to the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System
(NLETS) (Vehicle Code § 22854.5).
Within 48 hours of the storage of any such vehicle, excluding weekends and holidays, it shall be
the responsibility of the Traffic Bureau to determine the names and addresses of any individuals
having an interest in the vehicle through DMV or CLETS computers. Notice to all such individuals
shall be sent first-class or certified mail pursuant to Vehicle Code § 22851.3(d).
507.4 MARKING THE VEHICLE
Currently there are two methods of marking vehicles;
1. Electronic marking - which leaves no mark on the tires or vehicle; or
2. Chalk marking - which leaves a visible chalk mark on the tire.
Both methods are viable and both methods require a warning tag be placed on the windshield.
Additionally photographic evidence should be utilized when practical. Any deviation in markings
shall be noted in CAD.
507.5 FOLLOW-UPS
The member handling the initial investigation should conduct a follow up investigation after a
period of 72 hours to determine the status of the marked vehicle.
If the member returns to the location and determines the vehicle is present and there is no
indication of significant movement (“significant movement” means a vehicle has been moved from

the associated parking location by at least one car length), the member may issue a citation to
the vehicle. If a citation is issued, the member may also tow the vehicle pursuant to Vehicle Code
§ 22651(k).
If the member returns to the location and determines the vehicle has been moved, the member
shall ensure the associated CAD event is updated to indicate the outcome of the follow-up
investigation.
507.6 ABANDONED VEHICLE
If, by evidence and/or reliable citizen statement, it is determined a vehicle has been abandoned
(i.e., is inoperable as defined in Vehicle Code §22669(d) and/or has not been moved in a significant
period), the member may forego the initial marking and 72-hour follow-up procedures described
above.

any enforcement action. Should an initial investigation indicate that those steps are required, the
assistance of an officer shall be requested.
600.4 REPORT WRITING
600.4.1 FORMAT
SUMMARY: Provide a brief summary of the incident, including the corpus of the crime and final
status of the case.
INVESTIGATION: Provide a chronological description of the activities and statements of all

submitted to a patrol sergeant for review. The officer shall indicate in the report whether the case
should be closed, suspended, or reassigned to the Detective Bureau for follow-up. Continued
responsibility for the case remains with the assigned officer until the sergeant's review has been
completed. If the sergeant agrees that the preliminary investigation is complete, and concurs
with the officer's recommendation for disposition, the case will be approved and submitted into
AEGIS.If following the review, the sergeant does not feel that the investigation is complete or the
recommendation appropriate, the report shall be returned to the assigned officer for completion
and re-submission.

To prevent duplication of effort, officers should first contact their supervisor and the appropriate
Detective Bureau Detail before extensive follow-up work is done.
600.5 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION REQUIREMENTS
Suspects who are in custody and subjected to an interrogation shall be given the Miranda warning,
unless an exception applies. Interview or interrogation of a juvenile shall be in accordance with
the Temporary Custody of Juveniles Policy.
600.5.1 AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDINGS
Any custodial interrogation of an individual who is suspected of having committed any violent
felony offense should be recorded (audio or video with audio as available) in its entirety.
Consideration should also be given to recording a custodial interrogation, or any investigative
interview, for any other offense when it is reasonable to believe it would be appropriate and
beneficial to the investigation and is otherwise allowed by law.
No recording of a custodial interrogation should be destroyed or altered without written
authorization from the prosecuting attorney and the Detective Bureau supervisor. Copies of
recorded interrogations or interviews may be made in the same or a different format as the original
recording, provided the copies are true, accurate and complete and are made only for authorized
and legitimate law enforcement purposes.
Recordings should not take the place of a thorough report and investigative interviews. Written
statements from suspects should continue to be obtained when applicable.
600.5.2 MANDATORY RECORDING OF ADULTS
Any custodial interrogation of an adult who is suspected of having committed any murder shall
be recorded in its entirety. The recording should be video with audio if reasonably feasible (Penal
Code § 859.5).
This recording is not mandatory when (Penal Code § 859.5):
(a) Recording is not feasible because of exigent circumstances that are later documented
in a report.
(b) The suspect refuses to have the interrogation recorded, including a refusal any time
during the interrogation, and the refusal is documented in a report. If feasible, the
refusal shall be electronically recorded.
(c) The custodial interrogation occurred in another state by law enforcement officers
of that state, unless the interrogation was conducted with the intent to avoid the
requirements of Penal Code § 859.5.
(d) The interrogation occurs when no member conducting the interrogation has a
reason to believe that the individual may have committed murder. Continued
custodial interrogation concerning that offense shall be electronically recorded if the
interrogating member develops a reason to believe the individual committed murder.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Investigation and Prosecution
(e) The interrogation would disclose the identity of a confidential informant or would
jeopardize the safety of an officer, the individual being interrogated or another
individual. Such circumstances shall be documented in a report.
(f) A recording device fails despite reasonable maintenance and the timely repair or
replacement is not feasible.
(g) The questions are part of a routine processing or booking, and are not an interrogation.
(h) The suspect is in custody for murder and the interrogation is unrelated to a murder.
However, if any information concerning a murder is mentioned during the interrogation,
the remainder of the interrogation shall be recorded.
The Department shall maintain an original or an exact copy of the recording until a conviction
relating to the interrogation is final and all appeals are exhausted or prosecution is barred by law
(Penal Code § 859.5).
600.6 DISCONTINUATION OF INVESTIGATIONS
The investigation of a criminal case or efforts to seek prosecution should only be discontinued if
one of the following applies:
(a) All reasonable investigative efforts have been exhausted, no reasonable belief that
the person who committed the crime can be identified, and the incident has been
documented appropriately.
(b) The perpetrator of a misdemeanor has been identified and a warning is the most
appropriate disposition.
1. In these cases, the investigator shall document that the person was warned and
why prosecution was not sought.
2. Warnings shall not be given for felony offenses or other offenses identified in this
policy or by law that require an arrest or submission of a case to a prosecutor.
(c) The case has been submitted to the appropriate prosecutor but no charges have been
filed. Further investigation is not reasonable nor has the prosecutor requested further
investigation.
(d) The case has been submitted to the appropriate prosecutor, charges have been filed,
and further investigation is not reasonable, warranted, or requested, and there is no
need to take the suspect into custody.
(e) Suspects have been arrested, there are no other suspects, and further investigation
is either not warranted, or requested.
(f) Investigation has proven that a crime was not committed (see the Sexual Assault
Investigations Policy for special considerations in these cases).
The Domestic Violence, Child Abuse Sexual Assault Investigations, and Senior and Disability
Victimization policies may also require an arrest or submittal of a case to a prosecutor.

600.7 COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL EVIDENCE
The collection, preservation, transportation and storage of computers, cell phones and other
digital devices may require specialized handling to preserve the value of the related evidence. If
it is anticipated that computers or similar equipment will be seized, officers trained in computer
forensics should assist with seizing computers and related evidence. If an officer trained in
computer forensics is unavailable, officers should take reasonable steps to prepare for such
seizure and use the resources that are available.
600.8 INVESTIGATIVE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND INTERNET SOURCES
Use of social media and any other Internet source to access information for the purpose of criminal
investigation shall comply with applicable laws and policies regarding privacy, civil rights and
civil liberties. Information gathered via the Internet should only be accessed by members while
on-duty and for purposes related to the mission of this department. If a member encounters
information relevant to a criminal investigation while off-duty or while using his/her own equipment,
the member should note the dates, times and locations of the information and report the discovery
to his/her supervisor as soon as practicable. The member, or others who have been assigned to
do so, should attempt to replicate the finding when on-duty and using department equipment.
Information obtained via the Internet should not be archived or stored in any manner other than
department-established record keeping systems (see the Records Maintenance and Release and
the Criminal Organizations policies).
600.8.1 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS
Information that can be accessed from any department computer, without the need of an account,
password, email address, alias or other identifier (unrestricted websites), may be accessed and
used for legitimate investigative purposes without supervisory approval.
Accessing information from any Internet source that requires the use or creation of an account,
password, email address, alias or other identifier, or the use of nongovernment IP addresses,
requires supervisor approval prior to access. The supervisor will review the justification for
accessing the information and consult with legal counsel as necessary to identify any policy or
legal restrictions. Any such access and the supervisor approval shall be documented in the related
investigative report.
Accessing information that requires the use of a third party’s account or online identifier requires
supervisor approval and the consent of the third party. The consent must be voluntary and shall
be documented in the related investigative report.
Information gathered from any Internet source should be evaluated for its validity, authenticity,
accuracy and reliability. Corroborative evidence should be sought and documented in the related
investigative report.
Any information collected in furtherance of an investigation through an Internet source should be
documented in the related report. Documentation should include the source of information and
the dates and times that the information was gathered.

for revenue should never compromise the effective investigation of criminal offenses, officer safety
or any person’s due process rights.
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department that all members, including those assigned to
internal or external law enforcement task force operations, shall comply with all state and federal
laws pertaining to forfeiture.

2. There is probable cause to believe that the property was used or is intended to
be used in a violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and the seizing

(c) Forward the original seizure forms and related reports to the forfeiture reviewer within
two days of seizure.
The officer will book seized property as evidence with the notation in the comment section of
the property form, “Seized Subject to Forfeiture.” Property seized subject to forfeiture should be
booked on a separate property form. No other evidence from the case should be booked on this
form.
Photographs should be taken of items seized, particularly cash, jewelry and other valuable items.
Officers who suspect property may be subject to seizure but are not able to seize the property
(e.g., the property is located elsewhere, the whereabouts of the property is unknown, it is real
estate, bank accounts, non-tangible assets) should document and forward the information in the
appropriate report to the forfeiture reviewer.
602.5 MAINTAINING SEIZED PROPERTY
The Property and Evidence Unit Supervisor is responsible for ensuring compliance with the
following:
(a) All property, under his/her control, received for forfeiture is reasonably secured and
properly stored to prevent waste and preserve its condition.
602.6 FORFEITURE REVIEWER
The Chief of Police will appoint an officer as the forfeiture reviewer. Prior to assuming duties, or
as soon as practicable thereafter, the forfeiture reviewer should attend a department-approved
course on asset forfeiture.
The responsibilities of the forfeiture reviewer include:

The Department may request a court order so that certain uncontaminated science equipment is
relinquished to a school or school district for science classroom education in lieu of destruction
(Health and Safety Code § 11473; Health and Safety Code § 11473.5).
602.7.1 RECEIVING EQUITABLE SHARES

Informants
603.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for the use of informants.
603.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Informant - A person who covertly interacts with other individuals or suspects at the direction of,
request of, or by agreement with, the Berkeley Police Department for law enforcement purposes.
This also includes a person agreeing to supply information to the Berkeley Police Department for
a benefit (e.g., a quid pro quo in the form of a reduced criminal penalty, money).
Source of Information - An informant differs from a "source of information" in that the latter is
not under the specific direction of a single officer and does not become a party to the actual
investigation (e.g., a business firm furnishing information from its records, or a concerned citizen
relaying information about an event they have witnessed).
603.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes the value of informants to law enforcement efforts
and will strive to protect the integrity of the informant process. It is the policy of this department that
all funds related to informant payments will be routinely audited and that payments to informants
will be made according to the criteria outlined in this policy.
603.3 USE OF INFORMANTS
603.3.1 INITIAL APPROVAL
Before using an individual as an informant, an officer must receive approval from his/her
supervisor. The officer shall compile sufficient information through a background investigation and
experience with the informant in order to determine the suitability of the individual, including age,
maturity and risk of physical harm, as well as any indicators of his/her reliability and credibility.
Members of this department should not guarantee absolute safety or confidentiality to an
informant.
603.3.2 JUVENILE INFORMANTS
Except for the enforcement of laws related to the commercial sale of alcohol, marijuana or tobacco
products, a juvenile shall not be used as an informant.
It is the policy of this department that juveniles not be used as informants under any circumstances.
A juvenile may become a "source of information" as defined above, but under no circumstances
are they to be compensated for their information, or function as an undercover police operative.
603.3.3 INFORMANT AGREEMENTS
All informants are required to sign and abide by the provisions of the designated department
informant agreement. The officer using the informant shall discuss each of the provisions of the
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Informants - 512
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Informants
agreement with the informant. The agreement shall be signed by the officer, the informant and
a witness.
603.4 INFORMANT INTEGRITY
To maintain the integrity of the informant process, the following must be adhered to:
(a) The identity of an informant acting in a confidential capacity shall not be withheld from
the Chief of Police, Investigations Division Captain, Detective Bureau Lieutenant or
their authorized designee(s).
1. Identities of informants acting in a confidential capacity shall otherwise be kept
confidential.
(b) Criminal activity by informants shall not be condoned.
(c) Informants shall be told they are not acting as police officers, employees or agents of
the Berkeley Police Department, and that they shall not represent themselves as such.
(d) The relationship between department members and informants shall always be ethical
and professional.
1. Members shall not become intimately involved with an informant.
2. Social contact shall be avoided unless it is necessary to conduct an official
investigation, and only with prior approval of the Detective Bureau Lieutenant.
3. Members shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities or engage in any private
business transaction with an informant.
(e) Whenever practical, two officers should be present at all contacts with informants.
(f) In all instances when department funds are paid to informants, a voucher shall be
completed, itemizing the expenses.
(g) Since the decision rests with the appropriate prosecutor, officers shall not promise that
the informant will receive any form of leniency or immunity from criminal prosecution.
603.4.1 UNRELIABLE INFORMANTS
The reliability of any informant should be considered before engaging him/her in any way in
a covert or other investigative process. Members who become aware that an informant may
be unreliable will notify the supervisor, who will initiate a review to determine reliability. Until
a determination has been made by a supervisor, the informant should not be used by any
member. The supervisor shall document the decision and conditions in file notes and mark the
file “unreliable” when appropriate.
Considerations for determining whether an informant is unreliable include, but are not limited to,
the following:
(a) The informant has provided untruthful or unreliable information in the past.
(b) The informant behaves in a way that may endanger the safety of an officer.
(c) The informant reveals to suspects the identity of an officer or the existence of an
investigation.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Informants - 513

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Informants
(d) The informant appears to be using his/her affiliation with this department to further
criminal objectives.
(e) The informant creates officer-safety issues by providing information to multiple law
enforcement agencies simultaneously, without prior notification and approval of each
agency.
(f) The informant engages in any other behavior that could jeopardize the safety of
officers or the integrity of a criminal investigation.
(g) The informant commits criminal acts subsequent to entering into an informant
agreement.
603.5 INFORMANT FILES
Informant files shall be utilized as a source of background information about the informant, to
enable review and evaluation of information provided by the informant, and to minimize incidents
that could be used to question the integrity of department members or the reliability of the
informant.
Informant files shall be maintained in a secure area within the Detective Bureau. The Detective
Bureau Lieutenant or his/her designee shall be responsible for maintaining informant files. Access
to the informant files shall be restricted to the Chief of Police, Investigations Division Captain and
the Detective Bureau Lieutenant or their authorized designee(s).
603.5.1 FILE SYSTEM PROCEDURE
A file shall be maintained on each informant and shall be coded with an assigned informant control
number. An informant history that includes the following information shall be prepared for each file:
(a) Name and aliases
(b) Date of birth
(c) Physical description: sex, race, height, weight, hair color, eye color, scars, tattoos or
other distinguishing features
(d) Photograph
(e) Current home address and telephone numbers
(f) Current employers, positions, addresses and telephone numbers
(g) Vehicles owned and registration information
(h) Places frequented
(i) Briefs of information provided by the informant and his/her subsequent reliability
1. If an informant is determined to be unreliable, the informant's file is to be
marked "unreliable" and notations included detailing the issues that caused this
classification.
(j) Name of the officer initiating use of the informant
(k) Signed informant agreement

(l) Update on active or inactive status of informant
603.6 INFORMANT PAYMENTS
The amount of funds to be paid to any informant will be evaluated against the following criteria:
• The extent of the informant's personal involvement in the case
• The significance, value or effect on crime
• The value of assets seized
• The quantity of the drugs or other contraband seized
• The informant’s previous criminal activity
• The level of risk taken by the informant
603.6.1 PAYMENT PROCESS
Payments to an informant should be in cash using the Detective Bureau’s expense funds. A
payment voucher shall be filled out and signed by the informant, a detective and a witness for
each payment.
Payments exceeding $500.00 require a signature from the Investigations Division Captain on a
separate memorandum form.
Approved payments to an informant should be in cash using the following process:
(a) The officer delivering the payment shall complete a payment voucher which shall
include the following information:
1. A list of evidence and/or information obtained
2. The informant's assigned number
3. Berkeley Police Department case number and/or in-house case number
4. Payment amount
5. Date
(b) The payment voucher shall be signed by the informant.

Law Enforcement Manual
Eyewitness Identification
604.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy sets forth guidelines to be used when members of this department employ eyewitness
identification techniques (Penal Code § 859.7).
604.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to the policy include:
Eyewitness identification process - Any in-field show-up, live lineup or photographic
identification.
In-field show-up - A live presentation of a single or multiple individuals to a witness following
the commission of a criminal offense for the purpose of identifying or eliminating the person as
the suspect.
Live lineup - A live presentation of individuals, usually conducted in a formal setting, (i.e. a lineup
room at a jail) to a witness for the purpose of identifying or eliminating an individual as the suspect.
Photographic lineup - Presentation of photographs to a witness for the purpose of identifying or
eliminating an individual as the suspect.
604.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department will strive to use eyewitness identification techniques, when
appropriate, to enhance the investigative process and will emphasize identifying persons
responsible for crime and exonerating the innocent.
604.3 INTERPRETIVE SERVICES
Members should make a reasonable effort to arrange for an interpreter before proceeding with
eyewitness identification if communication with a witness is impeded due to language or hearing
barriers.
Before the interpreter is permitted to discuss any matter with the witness, the investigating member
should explain the identification process to the interpreter. Once it is determined that the interpreter
comprehends the process and can explain it to the witness, the eyewitness identification may
proceed as provided for within this policy.
604.4 EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION
Members are cautioned not to, in any way, influence a witness as to whether any subject or photo
presented in a lineup is in any way connected to the case.
Members should avoid mentioning that:
• The individual was apprehended near the crime scene.
• The evidence points to the individual as the suspect.
• Other witnesses have identified or failed to identify the individual as the suspect.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Eyewitness Identification - 516
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Eyewitness Identification
In order to avoid undue influence, witnesses should view suspects or a lineup individually and
outside the presence of other witnesses. Witnesses should be instructed to avoid discussing
details of the incident or of the identification process with other witnesses.
The eyewitness identification procedure should be audio and video recorded and the recording
should be retained according to current evidence procedures. When it is not feasible to make a
recording with both audio and visual representations, an audio recording should be made (Penal
Code § 859.7).
604.5 PHOTOGRAPHIC LINEUP AND LIVE LINEUP CONSIDERATIONS
When practicable, the member presenting the lineup should not be involved in the investigation
of the case or know the identity of the suspect. In no case should the member presenting a lineup
to a witness know which photograph or person in the lineup is being viewed by the witness (Penal
Code § 859.7). Techniques to achieve this include randomly numbering photographs, shuffling
folders, or using a computer program to order the persons in the lineup.
Individuals in the lineup should reasonably match the description of the perpetrator provided by the
witness and should bear similar characteristics to avoid causing any person to unreasonably stand
out. In cases involving multiple suspects, a separate lineup should be conducted for each suspect.
The suspects should be placed in a different order within each lineup (Penal Code § 859.7).
The member presenting the lineup should do so sequentially (i.e., show the witness one person
at a time) and not simultaneously. The witness should view all persons in the lineup.
A live lineup should only be used before criminal proceedings have been initiated against the
suspect. If there is any question as to whether any criminal proceedings have begun, the
investigating member should contact the appropriate prosecuting attorney before proceeding.
604.5.1 LINEUP ADMONITION
Prior to the lineup, members shall admonish the victim or witness using the appropriate admonition
from the Alameda County Double Blind Sequential Lineup Identification Form.
604.5.2 LINEUP PROCEDURES
Members shall conduct the lineup as follows:
(a) Assemble the suspect photo/suspect and at least five filler photos/persons. If there
are multiple suspects, assemble a photo/live lineup with different filler photos/persons
for each suspect.
(b) Numerically assign each photo/person and document the order.
(c) Confirm that the victim or witness understands the nature of the sequential procedure.
(d) Present each photo/person to the victim or witness separately in a previously
determined and random order.
(e) Have the victim or witness initial each photo after viewing it (for photo lineup only).
(f) Remove the photo or person from view before presenting the next photo or person.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Eyewitness Identification - 517
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Eyewitness Identification
(g) Record all results in writing, including the victim or witnesses own words. This
documentation should include positive, tentative and non-identifications.
1. In cases of positive or tentative identifications, ask the victim or witness why the
photo or person selected is/may be the suspect. Obtain a qualitative description
if the person is not certain of their identification, i.e. similar chin or eyes etc.
(h) Ask the victim or witness to sign and date the results.
(i) Document the lineup procedure to include identification information and the source
of all photos/persons used; names of all persons present at the lineup; and date and
time of the lineup.
(j) If more than one victim or witness is to view the same lineup, ensure they are physically
separated from one another during the lineup process so there is no communication
with one another.
(k) If more than one victim or witness is to view the same lineup, ensure you change
the order of photos or persons presented between each viewing. This will prevent
any possibility of victims or witnesses telling each other which number was picked.
Document this step.
(l) Instruct victims or witnesses to avoid discussing the details of the incident or the lineup
with other victims or witnesses.
Whenever possible, a photo/live lineup should be audio or video recorded.
604.5.3 OTHER SAFEGUARDS
Witnesses should be asked for suspect descriptions as close in time to the incident as possible
and before conducting an eyewitness identification. No information concerning a suspect should
be given prior to obtaining a statement from the witness describing how certain he/she is of the
identification or non-identification. Members should not say anything to a witness that that may
validate or invalidate an eyewitness’ identification. In photographic lineups, writings or information
concerning any previous arrest of a suspect shall not be visible to the witness (Penal Code §
859.7).
604.6 IN-FIELD SHOW-UPS
Field identifications, also known as in-field show-ups may be helpful in certain cases.
When determining whether to initiate an in-field show-up, the member should:
(a) Obtain a complete description of the suspect from the witness.
(b) Assess whether a witness should be included in a field identification process by
considering:
1. The length of time the witness observed the suspect.
2. The distance between the witness and the suspect.
3. Whether the witness could view the suspect’s face.
4. The quality of the lighting when the suspect was observed by the witness.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Eyewitness Identification - 518

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Eyewitness Identification
5. Whether there were distracting noises or activity during the observation.
6. Any other circumstances affecting the witness’s opportunity to observe the
suspect.
7. The length of time that has elapsed since the witness observed the suspect.
(c) If safe and practicable, the person who is the subject of the show-up should not be
handcuffed or in a patrol vehicle.
(d) When feasible, members should bring the witness to the location of the subject of the
show- up, rather than bring the subject of the show-up to the witness.
(e) The person who is the subject of the show-up should not be shown to the same witness
more than once.
(f) In cases involving multiple suspects, witnesses should only be permitted to view the
subjects of the show-up one at a time.
(g) The person who is the subject of the show-up should not be required to put on clothing
worn by the suspect, to speak words uttered by the suspect or to perform other actions
mimicking those of the suspect.
604.6.1 ADMONITION
Prior to the in-field show up, members shall provide the victim or witness with the following “In
Field Show-Up Admonition”:
“In a few minutes I am going to show you a person who may or may not be responsible for the
crime. The fact that this person is detained or handcuffed should not influence your judgment. The
person may or may not be wearing the same clothes at this time. You are not obligated to make
an identification. If you see the person involved, let me know, and explain why you have identified
this person. Do you understand?”
604.7 DOCUMENTATION
A description of the eyewitness process and the results of any eyewitness identification should
be documented in the case report.
If a photographic lineup is utilized, a copy of the photographic lineup presented to the witness
should be included in the case report. The original photographic lineup should be booked as
evidence.
604.7.1 DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO RECORDINGS
The handling member shall document the reason that a video recording or any other recording of
an identification was not obtained (Penal Code § 859.7).
604.7.2 DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO BLIND ADMINISTRATION
If a presentation of a lineup is not conducted using blind administration, the handling member shall
document the reason (Penal Code § 859.7).

Brady Material Disclosure
605.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes guidelines for identifying and releasing potentially exculpatory or
impeachment information (so-called “Brady information”) to a prosecuting attorney.
605.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Brady information -Information known or possessed by the Berkeley Police Department that is
both favorable and material to the current prosecution or defense of a criminal defendant.
605.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department will assist the prosecution by complying with its obligation to
disclose information that is both favorable and material to the defense. The Department will identify
and disclose to the prosecution potentially exculpatory information, as provided in this policy.
605.3 DISCLOSURE OF INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION
Officers must include in their investigative reports adequate investigative information and
reference to all material evidence and facts that are reasonably believed to be either incriminating
or exculpatory to any individual in the case. If an officer learns of potentially incriminating or
exculpatory information any time after submission of a case, the officer or the handling investigator
must prepare and submit a supplemental report documenting such information as soon as
practicable. Supplemental reports shall be promptly processed and transmitted to the prosecutor’s
office.
If information is believed to be privileged or confidential (e.g., confidential informant or protected
personnel files), the officer should discuss the matter with a supervisor and/or prosecutor to
determine the appropriate manner in which to proceed.
Evidence or facts are considered material if there is a reasonable probability that they would
affect the outcome of a criminal proceeding or trial. Determining whether evidence or facts are
material often requires legal or even judicial review. If an officer is unsure whether evidence or
facts are material, the officer should address the issue with a supervisor. The supervisor should
communicate this new information to the appropriate prosecutor.
605.4 DISCLOSURE OF PERSONNEL INFORMATION
Whenever it is determined that Brady information is located in the personnel file of a member of
this department who is a material witness in a criminal case, the following procedure shall apply:
(a) Any member who is the subject of such a motion shall be notified in writing that a
motion has been filed by the defense.
(b) An Internal Affairs Sergeant, as the custodian of confidential employee personnel
records, shall accompany all relevant files during any in camera inspection and
address any issues or questions raised by the court in determining whether any

Law Enforcement Manual
Brady Material Disclosure
information contained in the files is both material and favorable to the criminal
defendant.
(c) If the court determines that there is relevant Brady information contained in the files,
only that information ordered released by the judge will be copied and released to the
parties filing the motion.
1. Prior to the release of any information pursuant to this process, the Internal
Affairs Sergeant should request a protective order from the court limiting the use
of such information to the involved case and requiring the return of all copies
upon completion of the case.
605.5 INVESTIGATING BRADY ISSUES
If the Department receives information from any source that a member may have issues of
credibility, dishonesty or has been engaged in an act of moral turpitude or criminal conduct, the
information shall be investigated and processed in accordance with the Personnel Complaints
Policy.

Warrant Service
606.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes guidelines for the planning and serving of arrest and search warrants by
members of this department. It is understood that this policy cannot address every variable or
circumstance that can arise in the service of a search or arrest warrant, as these tasks can involve
rapidly evolving and unique circumstances.
This policy is intended to be used in conjunction with the Operations Planning and Deconfliction
Policy, which has additional guidance on planning and serving high-risk warrants.
This policy is not intended to address the service of search warrants on locations or property
already secured or routine field warrant arrests by patrol officers.
606.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to balance the safety needs of the public, the
safety of department members, privacy interests and other relevant factors when making decisions
related to the service of search and arrest warrants. The Sanctity of Life, as described in the Use
of Force policy, is a guiding principle.
606.3 SEARCH WARRANTS
Officers should receive authorization from a supervisor before preparing a search warrant
application. Once authorization is received, the officer will prepare the affidavit and search warrant
and submit the documents to a supervisor for review and approval.
No-knock warrants shall not be prepared, authorized, or executed by Berkeley Police Officers.
606.4 WARRANT PREPARATION
An officer who prepares a warrant should ensure the documentation in support of the warrant
contains as applicable:
(a) Probable cause to support the search or arrest, including relevant dates and times
to demonstrate timeliness and facts to support any request for nighttime warrant
execution.
(b) A clear explanation of the affiant’s training, experience and relevant education.
(c) Adequately supported opinions, when relevant, that are not left to unsubstantiated
conclusions.
(d) A nexus between the place to be searched and the persons or items central to
the investigation. The facts supporting this nexus should be clear and current. For
example, the affidavit shall explain why there is probable cause to believe that a
particular person is currently residing at a particular location or that the items sought
are present at a particular location.
(e) Full disclosure of known or suspected residents at the involved location and any
indication of separate living spaces at the involved location. For example, it should be

location, if reasonably available.
(g) A sufficient description of the items to be seized.
(h) Full disclosure of any known exculpatory information relevant to the warrant
application (refer to the Brady Material Disclosure Policy).
606.5 RISK ASSESSMENT
When a search or arrest warrant service is planned for a residence or locations or subjects that
present elevated risk, the supervisor will complete the Risk Assessment Worksheet and submit it,
along with the Operation Plan, to the Chain of Command for review and classification of risk (see
the Operations Planning and Deconfliction Policy).
If the warrant is not classified as high risk, the supervisor should weigh the risk of entry into a
residence to make an arrest against other alternatives, such as arresting or detaining the person
outside the residence where circumstances may pose a lower risk.
If the warrant is classified as high risk, the supervisor should contact the Bureau Lieutenant or
Division Captain to arrange a consultation with the Special Response Team (SRT) Commander.
606.6 HIGH-RISK WARRANT SERVICE
The SRT Commander, or his/her designee shall review warrants that are categorized as high
risk and shall confer with the Operations Division Captain to determine the manner in which the
warrant will be served, including the number of officers deployed. Only the Chief of Police, or his/
her designee, may authorize the use of SRT.
606.7 WARRANT SERVICE PROCEDURES
The member responsible for directing the service should ensure the following as applicable:
(a) Prior to making entry into a location, officers shall allow occupants a reasonable
amount of time to come to the door given the totality of the circumstances.
(b) When practicable and when doing so does not cause unreasonable risk, video or
photographic documentation is made of the condition of the location prior to execution
of a search warrant. The images should include the surrounding area and persons
present.
(c) The warrant service is audio- and video-recorded when practicable and reasonable
to do so.
(d) Evidence is handled and collected only by those members who are designated to do
so. All other members involved in the service of the warrant should alert one of the
designated members to the presence of potential evidence and not touch or disturb
the items.

under the circumstances.
(g) Reasonable care provisions are made for children and dependent adults (see the Child

Berkeley regarding any damage.
606.8 DETENTIONS DURING WARRANT SERVICE
Officers must be sensitive to the safety risks of all persons involved with the service of a warrant.
Depending on circumstances and facts present, it may be appropriate to control movements of
any or all persons present at a warrant service, including those who may not be the subject of a
warrant or suspected in the case. However, officers must be mindful that only reasonable force
may be used and weapons should be displayed no longer than the officer reasonably believes is
necessary (see the Use of Force Policy).
When it is determined that in an individual detained at the scene of a warrant service is not subject
to the scope of the warrant and that no reasonable suspicion or safety concerns exists, the person
should be released from the detention.
Officers should, when and to the extent reasonable, accommodate the privacy and personal needs
of people who have been detained.
606.9 ACTIONS AFTER WARRANT SERVICE
The supervisor shall ensure that all affidavits, warrants, receipts and returns, regardless of any
associated cases, are filed with the issuing judge or magistrate as soon as reasonably possible,
but in any event no later than any date specified on the warrant.
606.10 OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL WARRANTS

Operations Planning and Deconfliction
607.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines for planning, deconfliction and execution of high-risk operations.
Additional guidance on planning and serving high-risk warrants is provided in the Warrant Service
Policy.
607.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
High-risk operations - Operations, including service of search and arrest warrants and sting
operations, that are likely to present higher risks than are commonly faced by officers on a daily
basis, including suspected fortified locations, reasonable risk of violence or confrontation with
multiple persons, or reason to suspect that persons anticipate the operation.
Case officer - The officer in charge of the operation's intelligence, planning and execution.
607.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to properly plan and carry out high-
risk operations, including participation in a regional deconfliction system, in order to provide
coordination, enhance the safety of members and the public, decrease the risk of compromising
investigations and prevent duplicating efforts.
607.3 RISK ASSESSMENT
607.3.1 RISK ASSESSMENT FORM PREPARATION
Officers assigned as operational leads for any operation that may qualify as a high-risk operation
shall complete a risk assessment form.
When preparing the form, the officer should query all relevant and reasonably available intelligence
resources for information about the subject of investigation, others who may be present and the
involved location. These sources may include regional intelligence and criminal justice databases,
target deconfliction systems, firearm records, commercial databases and property records. Where
appropriate, the officer should also submit information to these resources.
The officer should gather available information that includes, but is not limited to:
(a) Photographs, including aerial photographs, if available, of the involved location,
neighboring yards and obstacles.
(b) Maps of the location.
(c) Diagrams of any property and the interior of any buildings that are involved.
(d) Historical information about the subject of investigation (e.g., history of weapon
possession or use, known mental illness, known drug use, threats against police, gang
affiliation, criminal history).

an off-site arrest or detention of the subject of investigation).
607.3.1 RISK ASSESSMENT REVIEW
The case officer will present the risk assessment form and other relevant documents (such as
copies of search warrants and affidavits and arrest warrants) to their supervisor.
The supervisor and case officer shall confer and determine the level of risk. Supervisors should
take reasonable actions if there is a change in circumstances that elevates the risks associated
with the operation.
607.3.3 HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS
If the case officer, after consultation with the involved supervisor, determines that the operation
is high risk, he/she should contact the Division Captain to arrange a consultation with the Special
Response Team (SRT) commander. Together, they should:

608.6 PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
Officers shall respond whenever prompt action is necessary and, if needed, conduct a preliminary
investigation, but the Detective Bureau is primarily responsible for the investigation of the following
cases:
(a) Homicide
Under most circumstances, the initial investigation at the scene and the preparation of
the crime report shall be solely a Detective Bureau assignment. Once responding officers
determine a homicide has occurred (or the victim is likely to expire) and no medical aid
is needed for others, the scene should be "FROZEN" and on#call Homicide personnel
shall be notified.
(a) Bank robbery
The initial investigation at the scene and the preparation of the crime report shall be
solely a Detective Bureau assignment. However, this shall not relieve the first officer
arriving on the scene of the responsibility for obtaining immediately and transmitting to the
Communications Center information essential to promptly apprehend the offender. During
non-business hours, attempts should be made to contact Robbery Detail personnel at
home. If Robbery Detail personnel are unable to respond, the Operations Division will
complete the investigation.
608.7 CASE MANAGEMENT
Copies of investigation reports will be electronically routed to the Detective Bureau and, upon
receipt by the detective sergeants, shall be distributed to the appropriately for follow-up and
disposition.
(a) Cases involving serious crimes against persons should be assigned for follow#up
contact and investigation.
(b) Cases involving crimes against property that have no evident productive leads (usually
assigned a "suspend" status by the Operations Division) will remain in the "suspended
status" following review and will be filed.
(c) Cases involving crimes against property that have potentially productive leads should
be assigned for investigation.
(d) Cases received in which deficiencies are noted shall be returned for correction to the
sergeant(s) having supervisory responsibility over the officer.
608.8 OUTSIDE AGENCIES
Requests from outside agencies for the investigations of local residents in connection with a felony
shall be assigned to the Detail who would be assigned to such an offense if committed in Berkeley

Law Enforcement Manual
Stolen Vehicle Investigations
609.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to explain procedures for completing stolen vehicle investigations.
609.2 POLICY
This department is governed in the acceptance and investigation of stolen vehicle reports by
Sections 10500, 10851 and 10855 of the California Vehicle Code and the applicable section of
487 of the California Penal Code.
609.3 VEHICLE DEFINITION
As defined by Section 670 of the California Vehicle Code, a "vehicle" is a device by which any
person or property may be propelled, moved, or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved
exclusively by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.
609.4 INITIAL PROCEDURES - COMMUNICATION CENTER
Communications Center personnel shall ensure that all information necessary to the investigation
of stolen vehicle reports is appropriately entered into the Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD)
database. Communications Center personnel shall check the tow log within the time period that
the alleged offense occurred, to ensure that a recently towed vehicle does not become reported
as stolen.
609.5 REPORTING PARTIES AND VICTIMS
The victim of the auto theft is always the registered owner. However, another person may be a
secondary victim of theft if they were borrowing the car and left their own personal property in the
car when it was stolen.
For example: A car is owned by “X” and is then borrowed by “Y”. “Y” parks the car, leaves her
purse behind, and the vehicle containing the purse is stolen. The victim of the auto theft is “X”
and the victim of the property theft is “Y”. In this circumstance, the officer should add “Y’s” contact
information in the notes section of the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS) entry, so when the vehicle is
recovered, “Y” can be contacted to come get her purse (if it’s still there).
609.6 CONTACTING THE VICTIM AND/OR REPORTING PARTY
609.6.1 CONFIRM IDENTIFICATION
In order to confirm the identity of the reporting party and/or victim, the handling officer shall take
stolen vehicle reports in-person. Any exceptions to an in-person report must be approved by the
officer's supervisor and the reason(s) why the report was not taken in-person shall be documented
in the report.
(a) The assigned officer shall take steps to verify the identification of the reporting party,
such as requesting driver's license information, especially in cases taken by telephone
and/or reported by an individual other than the registered owner.

Officers shall obtain and document as much contact information as possible from the victim and/
or reporting party, including cell, home and work phone numbers and an email address. The
Department’s goal is to provide the victim a reasonable opportunity to recover their vehicle prior
to it being towed.
Officers should also ascertain if the victim would like to pre-designate an “owner’s agent” to pick
up their car upon recovery if they are unavailable at the time of recovery and prior to the car being
towed.
Officers should advise the victim that in order for their agent to obtain a Vehicle Release
Authorization from BPD, they must have the following:
(a) A valid driver’s license or valid temporary driver’s license,
(b) A signed letter from the owner authorizing the release of the vehicle to the agent and
(c) A clear photocopy of the owner's license wherein the owner's signature matches the
signed letter.
If the victim decides to designate an agent, the officer shall document the agent's contact
information in the police report and in the “miscellaneous” field of the SVS entry form.
609.6.4 EXPLAINING THE VEHICLE RECOVERY PROCESS
The officer should explain what will happen in the event the car is found in the City of Berkeley.
This explanation should include:
(a) The owner or the owner’s agent will be contacted by Communications Center staff by
telephone at the time the vehicle is located. They will have a short time frame in which
they can retrieve their vehicle from the officer at the scene of the recovery.
(b) If the owner or the owner’s agent do not respond to the scene of the recovery
immediately, the car will be towed and stored for safekeeping. The owner or owner's
agent will be responsible for all fees incurred by the car being towed and/or stored.
(c) If the owner's vehicle is towed and stored, a Vehicle Release Authorization will need
to be obtained from the Department prior to going to the storage facility holding their
vehicle. All outstanding fees and fines owed to the City of Berkeley must be paid prior
to the issuance of a Vehicle Release Authorization. The City of Berkeley will waive
Vehicle Release Authorization fees for stolen vehicles.

Stolen Vehicle Investigations
609.11 RECOVERED VEHICLES - GENERALLY
When a stolen vehicle is found, the investigating officer shall request the SVS entry be confirmed
and complete the Auto Theft form. The report shall provide details of the following aspects of the
investigation:
(a) A detailed description of the method of starting/operating the vehicle ("hot-wire,"
ignition punch, etc.).
(b) A detailed description of damage, stripping of parts, or other vehicle conditions.
(c) The vehicle shall be searched for items of evidentiary value, and any evidence seized

Section 10855 of the Vehicle Code governs those situations "whenever any person who has
leased or rented a vehicle wilfully and intentionally fails to return the vehicle to its owner within
five days after the lease or rental agreement has expired, that person shall be presumed to have
embezzled the vehicle."
The assigned officer, prior to taking a report of an embezzled auto, shall confirm the victim vehicle
was leased or rented, not merely "loaned." They shall also confirm that the victim or victim business
has taken the following steps:
(a) Checked with the renter by phone to see why the vehicle has not been returned.

Stolen Vehicle Investigations
As part of a completed preliminary investigation, the assigned officer shall be responsible to ensure
copies of the rental agreement/contract, registered/certified letter and service card, along with any
other pertinent documentation and information, are routed to Records Management for attachment
to the case report.
609.14 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES / NON-RETURN OF "LOANED" VEHICLE
There has been a significant increase in the number of cases made to law enforcement agencies
involving citizens attempting to report as "stolen" vehicles they have voluntarily released or
"loaned" to another when that individual fails to return it by a specified date or time. Such "loaned"
vehicles include those "rented" between individuals, oftentimes for money or drugs.
According to the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, incidents involving vehicles which are
voluntarily released or "loaned" to another generally do not fall within the provisions of Section
10851 VC since this statute defines a mandatory element of this offense to be the actual taking
without the consent of the owner.
These cases are often difficult to classify. Depending upon the circumstances, they could fall within
the provisions of a variety of criminal and/or civil statutes.
In addition to basic stolen vehicle investigatory steps, the assigned officer shall
(a) Obtain identifying information and/or a description of the person to whom the vehicle
was loaned.
(b) Determine the date, time and location where the "loan" or "release" of vehicle took
place.

(d) Define the relationship between victim and suspect (i.e., relative, acquaintance,
stranger)
609.14.1 CLASSIFICATION AND ENTRY INTO SVS
The assigned officer shall classify the investigation as a "suspicious circumstance" and forward
the case to the Auto Theft Detail for follow up.
(a) An SVS entry shall not be made until a minimum of 14 calendar days has expired
from the specific date the vehicle was due to be returned and the District Attorney has
reviewed the case.
1. The District Attorney, in reviewing the case, will determine the appropriate
criminal classification, if any, warranted by the totality of the circumstances. This
information will be documented on the investigative report closing or suspending
the case. In those cases where the District Attorney's Office does not believe
the matter to be criminal, no SVS entry shall be made.
The Auto Theft Detail shall maintain records of auto thefts and embezzled vehicles as required by
the Department of Justice Information System (CJIS) Manual.

Personal Communication Devices
701.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of mobile telephones and
communication devices, whether issued or funded by the Department or personally owned, while
on-duty or when used for authorized work-related purposes.
This policy generically refers to all such devices as Personal Communication Devices (PCDs) but
is intended to include all mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), wireless capable
tablets and similar wireless two-way communications and/or portable Internet access devices.
PCD use includes, but is not limited to, placing and receiving calls, text messaging, blogging and
microblogging, emailing, using video or camera features, playing games and accessing sites or
services on the Internet.
701.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department allows members to utilize department-issued or funded PCDs
and to possess personally owned PCDs in the workplace, subject to certain limitations. Any
department-issued PCD used while on-duty, or used off-duty in any manner reasonably related to
the business of the Department, will be subject to monitoring and inspection consistent with the
standards set forth in this policy.
The inappropriate use of a PCD while on-duty may impair officer safety. Additionally, members
are advised and cautioned that the use of a personally owned PCD either on-duty or after duty
hours for business-related purposes may subject the member and the member’s PCD records to
civil or criminal discovery or disclosure under applicable public records laws.
Members who have questions regarding the application of this policy or the guidelines contained
herein are encouraged to seek clarification from supervisory personnel.
701.3 PRIVACY EXPECTATION
Members forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to any communication accessed,
transmitted, received or reviewed on any PCD issued or funded by the Department/Office and
shall have no expectation of privacy in their location should the device be equipped with location
detection capabilities (see the Information Technology Use Policy for additional guidance).
701.3.1 CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT (CALECPA)
No member is authorized to be the sole possessor of a department-issued PCD. Department-
issued PCDs can be retrieved, reassigned, accessed or used by any member as directed by a
supervisor without notice. Member use of a department-issued PCD and use of a personal PCD at
work or for work-related business constitutes specific consent for access for department purposes.
Prior to conducting an administrative search of a PCD, supervisors should consult legal counsel
to ensure access is consistent with CalECPA (Penal Code § 1546; Penal Code § 1546.1).

701.4 DEPARTMENT-ISSUED PCD
Depending on a member’s assignment and the needs of the position, the Department may,
at its discretion, issue or fund a PCD. Department-issued or funded PCDs are provided as a
convenience to facilitate on-duty performance only. Such devices and the associated telephone
number shall remain the sole property of the Department and may be subject to inspection or
monitoring (including all related records and content) at any time without notice and without cause.
701.5 PERSONALLY OWNED PCD
Members may carry a personally owned PCD while on-duty, subject to the following conditions
and limitations:
(a) Permission to carry a personally owned PCD may be revoked if it is used contrary to
provisions of this policy.
(b) The Department accepts no responsibility for loss of or damage to a personally owned
PCD.
(c) The PCD and any associated services shall be purchased, used and maintained solely
at the member’s expense.
(d) The device shall not be utilized to record or disclose any business-related information,
including photographs, video or the recording or transmittal of any information or
material obtained or made accessible as a result of employment with the Department,
without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.
(e) All work-related documents, emails, photographs, recordings or other public records
created or received on a member’s personally owned PCD should be transferred to
the Berkeley Police Department and deleted from the member’s PCD as soon as
reasonably practicable but no later than the end of the member’s shift.
Except with prior express authorization from their supervisor, members are not obligated or
required to carry, access, monitor or respond to electronic communications using a personally
owned PCD while off-duty. If a member is in an authorized status that allows for appropriate
compensation consistent with policy or existing memorandum of understanding or collective
bargaining agreements, or if the member has prior express authorization from his/her supervisor,
the member may engage in business-related communications. Should members engage in such
approved off-duty communications or work, members entitled to compensation shall promptly
document the time worked and communicate the information to their supervisors to ensure
appropriate compensation. Members who independently document off-duty department-related
business activities in any manner shall promptly provide the Department with a copy of such
records to ensure accurate record keeping.
701.6 USE OF PCD
The following protocols shall apply to all PCDs that are carried while on-duty or used to conduct
department business:

Personal Communication Devices
not be used as a substitute for, as a way to avoid, or in lieu of regular radio
communications.
(b) Members are prohibited from taking pictures, audio or video recordings or making
copies of any such picture or recording media unless it is directly related to official
department business. Disclosure of any such information to any third party through
any means, without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized
designee, may result in discipline.
(c) Using PCDs to harass, threaten, coerce or otherwise engage in inappropriate conduct
with any third party is prohibited. Any member having knowledge of such conduct shall
promptly notify a supervisor.
701.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of supervisors include, but are not limited to:
(a) Ensuring that members under their command are provided appropriate training on the
use of PCDs consistent with this policy.
(b) Monitoring, to the extent practicable, department-issued PCD use in the workplace and
taking prompt corrective action if a member is observed or reported to be improperly
using a department-issued PCD.
1. An investigation into improper conduct should be promptly initiated when
circumstances warrant.
2. Before conducting any administrative search of a member’s personally owned
device, supervisors should consult with the Chief of Police or the authorized
designee.
701.8 USE WHILE DRIVING
The use of a PCD while driving can adversely affect safety, cause unnecessary distractions and
present a negative image to the public. Officers operating emergency vehicles should restrict the
use of these devices to matters of an urgent nature and should, where practicable, stop the vehicle
at an appropriate location to use the PCD.
Members who are operating department vehicles that are not authorized emergency vehicles shall
not use a PCD while driving unless the device is specifically designed and configured to allow
hands-free use. In an emergency, a wireless phone may be used to place an emergency call
to the Department or other emergency services agency (Vehicle Code § 23123; Vehicle Code §
23123.5). Hands-free use should be restricted to business-related calls or calls of an urgent nature.
701.9 OFFICIAL USE
Members are reminded that PCDs are not secure devices and conversations may be intercepted
or overheard. Caution should be exercised while utilizing PCDs to ensure that sensitive information
is not inadvertently transmitted.

LRAD systems have the capability to provide highly effective long range communication. The
systems broadcast clear messages or voice commands. The systems can help to de-escalate
situations and safely modify dangerous and criminal behavior through clear, unambiguous
direction and communication.
LRAD systems are able to broadcast instructions and messages with greater clarity and distance
than traditional loudspeakers or public address systems. The systems can effectively broadcast
messages through wind, crowd, engine and background noise. LRAD broadcasts can be clearly
heard by people inside vehicles and buildings. The LRAD’s clear communication leads to a safer
environment during critical incidents and enhances the safety of the community, criminal subjects,
and public safety personnel.
707.4 USE OF THE LRAD
Law enforcement agencies may use the LRAD to:
1. Communicate lifesaving information to residents during disasters
2. Communicate to large crowds during parades, festivals, concerts and sporting events

709.4.1 BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT'S INVENTORY
Rifles and Associated Ammunitions
Rifle:
M4 Rifle (Description, purpose/authorized use, fiscal impact, legal and procedural, and
training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type: Colt M-4 patterned rifle, which fires the.223 Remington cartridge
Quantity: The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 96 rifles
Capabilities: The M4 pattern rifle is used only in situations when a potential life-threatening
situation exists. While a pistol is the common firearm used by police in these dangerous situations,
the M4 patterned rifle has numerous advantages over it. The ability to shoulder the rifle, coupled
with the rifle's lengthened barrel and ammunition, result in higher accuracy and lessens the chance
of officers missing the intended target. Additionally, due to the design of the rifle's bullet, the round
is less likely to over penetrate commercial and residential walls should the officer miss the intended
target. The rifle is also easier to use compared to a pistol because of the bullet's low recoil. Finally,
as the rifle can be adjusted and customized, it can be configured to accommodate officers of any
stature (hand size, strength, etc.).
Lifespan: Due to the rifle's ability to be maintained by department armorers, these rifles have a
relatively long-life span if properly maintained. However, the design has changed little in the last
60 years and we can expect new variations and designs to become the new industry standard
in the coming years.
Manufacturer's Description: This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features
many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully
retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 32inch length and weighs only 6.9 lb -
ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose: The M4 patterned rifle and associated ammunition is intended as a means to safely
stop a lethal threat. While a pistol is the firearm that all officers are minimally equipped with, the
rifle is an ancillary firearm for situations where increased distance and accuracy are needed to
safely resolve the situation.
Authorized Uses: Used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims of violent
crimes, general public, and officers. An officer considering the use of this firearm in a non-
preplanned incident should consider the factors set forth in the Risk Assessment section of Policy
607, Operations, Planning, and Deconfliction.
FISCAL IMPACT:
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Military Equipment - 579
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Military Equipment
Initial Cost: Exact costs unknown. Rifle prices, like other firearms, will range depending on current
market demand and availability. While M4 rifles purchased several years ago cost between $1,000
and $1,200 a piece, current rifles cost between $1,400 and $1,600. It should be expected that
these prices will fluctuate and likely increase over time.
Annual cost: Cost of use for all firearms should be based on the ammunition used in training
and on duty. This will fluctuate based on whether the rifle is issued to a patrol officer, a firearms
instructor, or a Special Response Team member as each assignment has different training
requirements.
Training costs: Every officer that is authorized to carry a rifle on duty must attend a 16-hour
CA POST approved rifle instruction course before being authorized to carry the rifle on duty.
This course may be administered by Berkeley Police Firearm Instructors or by other POST
approved agencies. Tuition for the CA POST approved class is dependent on the hosting agency.
If conducted in house the cost only includes the officer's hourly wage, range fee, and ammunition
costs (all vary). Outside agencies charge between $25 to $500 depending on the range location
and duration (some classes are 32-hours while POST only requires 16-hours.) Additionally, all
officers issued a rifle receive specific 8-hour rifle training every two years by POST certified BPD
firearm instructors.
Maintenance costs: Vary depending on use over time. Traditionally, various springs and pins
need to be replaced every five years and may cost between $3 and $30 per rifle. Other parts such
as the barrel and bolt need replaced around ten years and range between $150 and $300 per rifle.
LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES:
Authorized use must comply with state, federal laws, and Policy 300 Use of Force, and Policy 349
Tactical Rifle Operator Program. The use of this equipment shall comply with the authorizations
and prohibitions set forth in Policy 300 – Use of Force. It is the policy of the BPD to utilize rifles
only for official law enforcement purposes, and pursuant to State and Federal law regarding the
use of force including the provisions of Penal Code Section 13652.
TRAINING:
Prior to using a rifle, officers must be certified by POST instructors in the operation of the rifle.
Additionally, all members that operate any rifle are required to pass a range qualification.
Remington 700 Rifle (Description, purpose/authorized use, fiscal impact, legal and
procedural, and training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type: Remington 700 rifle, which fires the.308 caliber ammunition.
Quantity: The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 6 rifles
Capabilities: The Remington 700 rifle, with the appropriate ammunition, training, and practice, is
capable of consistent and highly accurate shooting out to a distance of approximately 500-yards.

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Military Equipment
The Remington 700 is intended to be used in emergency situations where there is a high potential
for violence, where the need exists to put distance between officers and a specific individual, such
as an armed hostage situation.
Lifespan: The Remington 700 bolt-action rifles have an expected life span of 10-years if properly
maintained.
Manufacturer's Description: The Model 700 SPS Tactical is a highly maneuverable member
of the family. It's built for tack-driving accuracy with a 20" heavy-contour tactical-style barrel and
dual-point pillar bedding in its black synthetic stock. Hogue® overmoldings on the stock facilitate
sure handling, and it has a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability off a rest.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose: This rifle is to be used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims
of violent crimes, general public, and officers. This rifle provides police with the benefit of adding
distance to a volatile situation which can increase the safety for community members and officers.
This rifle is an ancillary firearm for situations where increased distance and accuracy is needed
to safely resolve the situation.
Authorized Uses: Used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims of violent
crimes, general public, and officers. An officer considering the use of this firearm in a non-
preplanned incident should consider the factors set forth in the Risk Assessment section of Policy
607, Operations, Planning, and Deconfliction.
FISCAL IMPACT:
Initial Cost: The initial cost to purchase this rifle with its associated components is approximately
$10,000 dollars each. Their average life span is 10-years at which time it will likely need to be
replaced.
Annual cost: If this rifle is not cared for or maintained well, then a potential financial adverse
impact would be the premature purchasing of a replacement rifle or replacement parts. However,
authorized and trained Berkeley Police armorers service and provide regular maintenance of the
rifles. The cost of maintenance is staff time.
Training costs: The cost associated with training is the staff time, range fees, and cost of
spent ammunition. SRT members train once a month and, on average, each member shoots
approximately 50-rounds. Currently, there are only 4 members shooting at each training day. This
equates to approximately 2,400 rounds of ammunition being fired per year. This does not include
special training days or attendance to training schools/classes. A single box of 20-rounds costs
approximately $20-dollars or $1 dollar per round.
Maintenance costs: Maintenance costs vary depending on use over time. Firing pins need to be
replaced every 5 to 7 years. The maintenance cost associated with this rifle is minimal.
There are no costs associated with maintenance or storage of ammunition. All ammunition is
stored in a climate-controlled room in the Berkeley Police Department.

Barret Model 99 Rifle (Description, purpose/authorized use, fiscal impact, legal and
procedural, and training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type: The Barrett Model 99 rifle is a single shot bolt-action 50-caliber rifle
Quantity: The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 1 rifle.
Capabilities: This rifle is used only in situations where a potential life-threatening situation exists.
The length of the rifle's barrel coupled with the ammunition result in precision accuracy. This rifle
is capable of disabling any vehicle engine block because of the large caliber round.
Lifespan: This rifle has been in our possession for almost 15-years and we expect it to last for an
additional 20 years or more considering how in-frequently it's used.
Manufacturer's Description: The Model 99 brings new levels of long-range precision shooting.
Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you
can rely on.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose: The Barrett rifle is a firearm that may be used to stop a vehicle which poses a lethal
threat to the public, or to disable a vehicle which presents a threat to the safety of another person(s)
by its continued use. There are vehicle disabling tools that may disable vehicles by slowly deflating
the tires; however, even with tires deflated a vehicle has the ability to operate and remain a threat
to the public. Furthermore, these tools must be hand deployed and, in most circumstances, require
officers to expose themselves to deadly threats. The Barrett rifle creates the ability to effectively
disable vehicles instantaneously from a distance away.
Authorized Uses: Used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims of violent
crimes, general public, and officers. An officer considering the use of this firearm in a non-
preplanned incident should consider the factors set forth in the Risk Assessment section of Policy
607, Operations, Planning, and Deconfliction.

Less Lethal Launchers:
Penn Arms 40mm Single Launcher (Description, purpose/authorized use, fiscal impact,
legal and procedural, and training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type: Penn Arms 40mm Single Launcher
Quantity:The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 20.
Capabilities:The Penn Arms single launcher is capable of firing a single projectile out to a
maximum manufacturer recommended range of 45 meters. The Penn Arms 40mm projectiles are
direct fire with a pliable "sponge" tip designed to mold to the body. The projectiles are about the
size of a large egg. Upon impact, the projectile transfers kinetic energy to the body to gain pain
compliance. Large muscle groups such as the upper legs or lower abdomen are approved target
areas unless a higher level of force is justified. This level of force is considered to be similar to
that of a baton strike.
Lifespan:The manufacturer expected lifespan is about 10 years depending on use and regular
maintenance.
Manufacturer's Description:A 40mm compact single-shot break-open frame launcher with a
rifled barrel and folding stock. Features include: Double-action trigger, trigger lock push button
and hammer lock safeties.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose:The purpose of kinetic energy impact projectiles, commonly referred to as "less lethal" is
to preserve life, minimize the use of force and allow time for de-escalation. Less lethal projectiles

allow the user to maintain a safe distance from a subject who is armed and/or demonstrates the
intent to be violent. The ability to maintain a safe distance – while still providing a level of control
over the subject – allows officers to employ de-escalation techniques, request additional resources
and develop a plan to safely resolve the situation with the least amount of risk.
Violent or armed confrontations are inherently dangerous to all those involved. Officers are
required to make split second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly
evolving. An Officer's threat perception of a person who is in close proximity as opposed to a
person who is at a distance of 20 yards is naturally different. A person in close proximity intent
on violence has the ability to immediately utilize personal body weapons, a bludgeoning device
or cutting instrument. The immediacy requires the Officer to react instantly and there is a greater
potential that a higher level of force will be needed.
On the other hand, a person at a distance of 20 yards may not be perceived as having the
immediate ability to violently attack the Officer. The person must first close the distance before
certain weapons can be utilized. This fact may allow the Officer time to decide the most appropriate
course of action, such as the use of a "less lethal" projectile.
The projectiles are designed to provide a high level of accuracy which minimizes the risk of
unwanted impacts. The ability to apply force from a distance reduces the potential for violent
confrontation and aides in reducing the level of force needed to safely resolve a conflict.
Authorized Uses: Use must comply with local, state, federal laws, and Policy 300 Use of Force,
Policy 303 Control Devices, and Policy 428 First Amendment Assembly.
FISCAL IMPACT:
Initial Cost:Less lethal prices, like other equipment, varies depending on market demand and
availability. The most recent Penn Arms purchased by the department cost $815.00 each.
Annual cost: Cost for Penn Arms single launcher use should be based on the projectiles used in
training and on duty. This will fluctuate based on department trainings, projectile availability and
events that unfold in the city and surrounding region.
Training costs:Every officer authorized to deploy a less lethal launcher must pass a certification
course administered by a Berkeley Police Department Firearms Instructor. The certification class
consists of classroom, range qualification and scenario application if the venue allows. This class
is largely handled in house thus the cost only includes staff time, range fees, and projectile costs
which all vary.
Maintenance costs:Maintenance costs vary depending on use. Generally, various springs and
pins need to be replaced every 5 years which can cost $3 to $30.
LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES:
Authorized use must comply with state, federal laws, and Policy 300 Use of Force, Policy 303
Control Devices, and Policy 428 First Amendment Assembly.

FISCAL IMPACT:
Initial Cost:Less lethal prices, like other equipment, varies depending on market demand and
availability. The most recent FN 303s purchased by the department cost $800.00 each.
Annual cost:Cost for FN 303 use should be based on the projectiles used in training and on duty.
This will fluctuate based on department trainings, projectile availability and events that unfold in
the city and surrounding region.
Training costs:Every officer authorized to deploy a less lethal launcher must pass a certification
course administered by a Berkeley Police Firearm Instructor. The certification class consists of
classroom, range qualification and scenario application if the venue allows. This class is largely
handled in house thus the cost only includes the officer's hourly wage, range fees, and projectile
costs which all vary.
Maintenance costs:Maintenance costs vary depending on use. Generally, O-rings need to be
replaced every 3000 rounds and cost $30 per kit.
LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES:

Light/sound Diversionary Devices:
CTS 7290 Diversionary Device (Description, purpose/authorized use, fiscal impact, legal
and procedural, and training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type:CTS 7290 Diversionary Device
Quantity:The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 50.
Capabilities:When a diversionary device is deployed they create a loud noise, heat and brilliant
light and create an effective diversion. They can create psychological and physiological effects
such as: hearing a loud noise beyond that of everyday living, seeing a short bright light, and feeling
of a change in atmospheric pressure. These effects may disorient/confuse subjects for a short
time giving tactical teams the ability to apprehend that subject without using a higher level of force.
Lifespan:The lifespan of the CTS 7290 Diversionary Device is 5 years.
Manufacturer's Description: The CTS 7290 is the standard for diversionary flash-bang devices.
The 7290 produces a 165-180 db and 6-8 million candela of light output. The patented design of

Military Equipment
the 7290, incorporates a porting system that eliminates movement of the body at detonation even
if the top or bottom of the device should be in contact with a hard surface. In addition, internal
adjustments have greatly reduced smoke output.
Flash Bangs are used by special tactical units during hostage rescue and high-risk warrants. It
is an ATF-controlled Class-C explosive device that emits a bright light and thunderous noise to
distract potentially dangerous individuals.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose: The purpose of a diversionary device is to create a reactionary gap of a person
by temporarily disorienting them. This gap gives tactical teams an opportunity to apprehend a
suspect while using the minimal amount of force possible. They can also be used to safely invoke
a response or redirect the attention of subjects who are either feigning injury, ignoring police
commands or are unresponsive while posing a threat to the public.
Authorized Uses:The use of a diversionary device is to create a diversion in order to facilitate
entry and enable arrest. Circumstances justifying the use of a diversionary device may include,
but not limited to barricaded subject or hostage situations and high-risk search warrants services.
FISCAL IMPACT:
Initial Cost:Diversionary Devices cost approximately $45 per unit and are purchased through LC
Action Police Supply. Purchases for these tools are made when inventory becomes low, based
upon critical incident usage and Special Response Team trainings that incorporate live devices.
Annual cost: See below training cost.
Training costs:Only trained and qualified personnel are permitted to deploy diversionary devices.
These trained Berkeley Police officers are typically members of the Berkeley Police Department
Special Response Team who receive monthly training which includes training in the deployment
of diversionary devices. The cost of training is staff time.
Maintenance costs:The majority of diversionary devices are stored inside of a room in the
basement within the Police Department. There are no additional storage costs. There are no
associated costs to transporting, maintenance, or upgrades.

impact, legal and procedural, and training)
Description (type of equipment, quantity, capabilities, lifespan, and product description
from manufacture)
Type:The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD)
Quantity: The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains possesses 2 Long Range
Acoustic Devices (LRAD) speakers. One is an LRAD 450XL and the other is an LRAD 100X.
Capabilities:Both of these speakers are able to focus sound in directional pattern allowing the
user to make sound audible over distances much greater than conventional public address
speakers. The LRAD 450XL is the larger of the two and designed to either be used in a fixed
location or mounted on a vehicle to make it portable. It has a usable range of approximately 1
mile. The LRAD 100X is smaller and more portable. It can be carried or mounted to a person's
chest for mobility or mounted to a vehicle. Its range is approximately 1/3 of a mile. Both of these
systems allow for clear long-range communication, they are also able to play recorded messages.
Lifespan:The lifespan for both LRADs is 25 years.
Manufacturer's Description: LRAD 100x In addition to being 20 – 30 decibels louder than
bullhorns and vehicle-based P.A. systems, the LRAD 100X is also up to 6X louder and much more
intelligible than other hailing devices of comparable size and weight. Live or recorded broadcasts
from the portable LRAD 100X easily overcome engines, sirens and noisy crowds to ensure every
message is heard and understood. The LRAD warning tone safely alerts attention to the voice
messages that follow, establishes large standoff zones, and is the safer crowd control alternative
to non-lethal and kinetic measures.
LRAD 450XL- The LRAD 450XL utilizes technology developed and patented* by Genasys Inc.
to provide the audio output of larger acoustic hailers almost twice its size and weight, while
delivering the same outstanding vocal clarity inherent in all LRAD systems. The LRAD 450XL
broadcasts powerful warning tones to command attention to the highly intelligible voice messages
that follow, enabling operators to change behavior and enhance response capabilities with safe,
scalable escalation of force. Lightweight and designed for use on tripods or mounted on vessels,
vehicles, and Remote Weapon Stations (RWS), the LRAD 450XL is a highly effective, long range
communication system in use around the world for public safety, law enforcement, maritime and
defense applications.
PURPOSE and AUTHORIZED USE:
Purpose:The LRADs are designed for clear long-range communication. The LRAD's ability to
communicate over a long distance is far superior to any megaphone or Public Address (PA) system
mounted to a police vehicle. Additionally, LRAD's may be used to:
• Communicate lifesaving information to residents during disasters
• Communicate to large crowds during parades, festivals, concerts and sporting events

information from the caller by using the "5 W's" format:

• Weapons (first responder/citizen safety hazards)?
• Who (description of involved subjects)?
If the dispatcher determines that the caller has a hearing and/or speech impairment or disability,
he/she shall immediately initiate a connection with the individual via available TDD/TTY equipment
or Telephone Relay Service (TRS), as mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
If the dispatcher determines that the caller is a limited English proficiency (LEP) individual, the
dispatcher should quickly determine whether sufficient information can be obtained to initiate
an appropriate response. If language assistance is still needed, the language is known and
a language-appropriate authorized interpreter is available in the Communications Center, the
dispatcher should immediately connect the LEP caller to the authorized interpreter.
If no authorized interpreter is available or the dispatcher is unable to identify the caller’s language,

party call connecting the dispatcher, the LEP individual and the interpreter.
Dispatchers should be courteous, patient and respectful at all times.
801.5.1 EMERGENCY CALLS
A call is considered an emergency when there is an immediate or potential threat to life or serious
property damage, and the timely arrival of public safety assistance is of the utmost importance. A
person reporting an emergency should not be placed on hold until the dispatcher has obtained all
necessary information to ensure the safety of the responding department members and affected
individuals.
Emergency calls should be dispatched immediately. The Watch Commander shall be notified of
pending emergency calls for service when department members are unavailable for dispatch.

demonstrate to the officer that an attempt was made to obtain the information and it
was not an oversight on your part.

the potential dangers sometimes hidden in bags. Items which need to be searched
should be directed to a Community Service Officer (CSO) at the Jail Bail window during
business hours.
(c) Itemize the found property on the form. If cash or valuables are turned in, it is
recommended that either the community member turning in the property or a co-
worker confirm the form is accurate by signing the form as a witness.

assigned to the call. The case number may be given to the community member
reporting the found property.
(e) Place the property and the Found Property form in the blue locker next to the break
room in the Records Bureau. The code for the locker will be the same code used to
enter the PSB parking lot.
(f) The dispatched officer will retrieve the found property and handle it per normal
protocol.

money coming into the possession of any member of the Police Department shall

of such property (with the exception of returning found and unclaimed property to the
finder) are set forth in the ordinance.
(b) California law distinguishes between a police employee finding an article or money in
the course of his/her employment and the usual case where the finder has superior title
against anyone except the real owner. It is the duty of a police employee to forfeit all
claim of title to any article found or surrendered to him/her in the course of employment.

this Department take custody of the item and stipulate that it be returned at the finder’s
expense if the rightful owner cannot be located. The citizen shall be advised:
1. If no owner appears and proves ownership of the property within 90 days, the
finder may take title to the property if requested within 30 days after expiration
of the 90-day period.
2. If the finder makes claim to the property within 30 days after expiration of the
90-day period, the Property Officer or Property Clerk can release the property
to the claimant if the value is less than $250.00.
3. If the property value is $250.00 or greater, the Property Officer or Property
Clerk shall arrange for a notice of the found property to be published in a local
newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall appear in at least one local
newspaper for a minimum of one week and costs shall be paid by the finder.
4. If, after seven days following the publishing of the notice, no owner appears
and proves ownership, title to the property shall vest in the finder. The finder

reimbursement to the Police Department for the publication of the notice
described in (c) above.

necessary cancellations are made in Departmental files whenever property is released
under this Order. These cancellations are usually restricted to firearms entries in AFS.
(e) It is not mandatory that citizens turn in found property to this Department; however,
the procedure set forth above should be complied with to protect the finder from being

theft unless he/she makes a reasonable effort to find and restore the property to its
rightful owner.
(f) Should the finder wish to retain the property and proceed to gain title as set forth in this
Order, a numbered report shall be prepared, a complete description of the property
obtained, and the description checked against all appropriate files and systems (Local,
State, etc.) in an attempt to locate the owner.

(c) The Property Officer shall maintain information on all property that has been destroyed
and shall forward that information to the Records Bureau for placement in the
applicable record storage system.
802.33 CONVERSION OF PROPERTY TO AGENCY OR PUBLIC USE
Civil Code Section 2080.4 and Penal Code Section 1411 provide that, if a City or county has
enacted an enabling ordinance, certain unclaimed property held in the custody of the agency may
be retained for agency or other public use, rather than being sold or destroyed. The California
Penal Code provides the authority for acquisition of firearms for agency use.
(a) Requests for acquisition for Departmental or other public use of unclaimed property

to the main Property Rooms as soon as possible, and that the main Property Rooms received
the necessary paper work to dispose of evidence/property no longer having evidentiary value.

802.37 AUDITS
In December 2000, an automated property system was instituted. In order to ensure the credibility
of this automated property system, a series of regular audits will be instituted. The following audits
will be performed:
(a) Monthly Audits: At least once each month, the Property Officer or Property Clerk
will conduct a random audit of 25 items of property from various locations within the
drug and property rooms. This monthly audit will examine the records for these items
and confirm the status and location of each of these items is correct. The Property
Officer will additionally conduct a “Cash” audit of the Property Room and determine
the amount of cash currently stored within the Property Room. Once each month, the
Property Officer or Property Clerk will check the “Chain of Custody” disposition records
in AEGIS, or a manual log. When an article has been out of the Property Room for
two weeks or more, the Property Officer will contact the employee that checked out
the item of property and determine its status. Items out for more than two weeks shall
have an explanation placed in AEGIS. The results of each of these audits shall be
reported to the respective Division Captains.
(b) Bi-Annual Audits: The Professional Standards Bureau Audit and Inspections Sergeant
will be responsible for conducting audits of all of the Property Rooms at least twice a
year. The Property Officer and Property Clerk will use portable barcode scanners to
audit 100 pieces of property in their respective Property Rooms. The audit will check
for the correct locations and status of each item. This audit will also check at least 5
different property locations and two drug evidence locations and confirm that those
locations contain all the individual pieces of property that the AEGIS has assigned
to those locations and ensure that there has been no tampering of the evidence.
The results of each of these audits shall be reported to the Chief of Police, via the
Professional Standards Division chain of command. The results will also be shared
with the Captain and Lieutenant of the Support Services Division.
Whenever a new Property Officer is appointed, outgoing and incoming personnel shall conduct a
joint inventory. The purpose of the inventory is to ensure the continuity of custody and not require
the accounting of every single item of property. The inventory should be sufficient to ensure the
integrity of the system and the accountability of the property. The person assuming custody of
the property should ensure that all records are current and any discrepancies are recorded and
reported to the Support Services Division Captain prior to the assumption of property accountability
by the newly appointed custodian.

803.4 DETERMINATION OF FACTUAL INNOCENCE
In any case where a person has been arrested by officers of the Berkeley Police Department and
no accusatory pleading has been filed, the person arrested may petition the Department to destroy
the related arrest records. Petitions should be forwarded to the Support Services Lieutenant.
The Support Services Lieutenant should promptly contact the prosecuting attorney and request
a written opinion as to whether the petitioner is factually innocent of the charges (Penal Code §
851.8). Factual innocence means the accused person did not commit the crime.
Upon receipt of a written opinion from the prosecuting attorney affirming factual innocence, the
Records Supervisor should forward the petition to the Detective Bureau Lieutenant and the City
Attorney for review. After such review and consultation with the City Attorney, the Detective Bureau
Lieutenant and the Records Supervisor shall decide whether a finding of factual innocence is
appropriate.
Upon determination that a finding of factual innocence is appropriate, the Records Supervisor
shall ensure that the arrest record and petition are sealed for later destruction and the required
notifications are made to the California DOJ and other law enforcement agencies (Penal Code
§ 851.8).
The Records Supervisor should respond to a petition with the Department’s decision within 45
days of receipt. Responses should include only the decision of the Department, not an explanation
of the analysis leading to the decision.
803.5 ARREST WITHOUT FILING OF ACCUSATORY PLEADING
(a) The Operations Division Captain should ensure a process is in place for when an
individual is arrested and released and no accusatory pleading is filed so that the
following occurs (Penal Code § 849.5; Penal Code § 851.6):
1. The individual is issued a certificate describing the action as a detention.
(b) The Support Services Division Captain should ensure the following occurs:
1. All references to an arrest are deleted from the arrest records of the Department
and the record reflects only a detention.
2. The California DOJ is notified.
803.6 FILE ACCESS AND SECURITY
The security of files in the Records Management must be a high priority and shall be maintained as
mandated by state or federal law. All case reports including but not limited to initial, supplemental,
follow-up, evidence, and any other reports related to a police department case, including field
interview (FI) cards, criminal history records, and publicly accessible logs, shall be maintained in
a secure area within the Records Management, accessible only by authorized members of the
Records Management. Access to case reports or files when Records Management staff is not
available may be obtained through the Watch Commander.
The Records Management will also maintain a secure file for case reports deemed by the Chief
of Police as sensitive or otherwise requiring extraordinary access restrictions.

804.4 PROCESSING REQUESTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS
Any department member who receives a request for any record shall route the request to the
Custodian of Records or the authorized designee.
804.4.1 REQUESTS FOR RECORDS
Any member of the public, including the media and elected officials, may access public records of
this department, during regular business hours by submitting a request that reasonably describes
each record sought and paying any associated fees (Government Code § 6253).
The processing of requests for any record is subject to the following (Government Code § 6253):
(a) The Department is not required to create records that do not exist.
(b) Victims of an incident or their authorized representative shall not be required to
show proof of legal presence in the United States to obtain department records or
information. If identification is required, a current driver's license or identification card
issued by any state in the United States, a current passport issued by the United States
or a foreign government with which the United States has a diplomatic relationship or
current Matricula Consular card is acceptable (Government Code § 6254.30).
(c) Either the requested record or the reason for non-disclosure will be provided no later
than 10 days from the date of request, unless unusual circumstances preclude doing
so. If more time is needed, an extension of up to 14 additional days may be authorized
by the Custodian of Records or the authorized designee. If an extension is authorized,
the Department shall provide the requester written notice that includes the reason for
the extension and the anticipated date of the response.
1. When the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the
Custodian of Records shall assist the requester in making the request focused
and effective in a way to identify the records or information that would be
responsive to the request including providing assistance for overcoming any
practical basis for denying access to the records or information. The Custodian of
Records shall also assist in describing the information technology and physical
location in which the record exists (Government Code § 6253.1).
2. If the record requested is available on the department website, the requester
may be directed to the location on the website where the record is posted. If the
requester is unable to access or reproduce the record, a copy of the record shall
be promptly provided.
(d) Upon request, a record shall be provided in an electronic format utilized by the
Department. Records shall not be provided only in electronic format unless specifically
requested (Government Code § 6253.9).
(e) When a record contains material with release restrictions and material that is not
subject to release restrictions, the restricted material shall be redacted and the
unrestricted material released.
1. A copy of the redacted release should be maintained in the case file for proof
of what was actually released and as a place to document the reasons for
the redactions. If the record is audio or video, a copy of the redacted audio/

video release should be maintained in the department-approved media storage
system and a notation should be made in the case file to document the release
and the reasons for the redacted portions.
(f) If a record request is denied in whole or part, the requester shall be provided a written
response that includes the statutory exemption for withholding the record or facts that
the public interest served by nondisclosure outweighs the interest served by disclosure
(Government Code § 6255). The written response shall also include the names, titles
or positions of each person responsible for the denial.

people arrested for non-violent offenses by the Berkeley Police Department or other departments
acting in mutual aid at First Amendment Events, as defined in Policy 428. The Berkeley Police
Department and other City employees may broadcast the fact of arrests having been made,
and details of the reasons and circumstances of such arrests, so long as personal identifying
information is not included.
Restrictions on broadcasting identifying information about individuals arrested for non-violent
violations in conjunction with First Amendment Events shall not limit or diminish the City's

based and other limitations. This prohibition does not apply to any suspect or suspects identified

Generally, discovery requests and subpoenas from criminal defendants and their authorized
representatives (including attorneys) should be referred to the District Attorney, City Attorney or
the courts.

prepared.
804.9 RELEASED RECORDS TO BE MARKED
Each page of any written record released pursuant to this policy should be stamped in a colored
ink or otherwise marked to indicate the department name and to whom the record was released.
Each audio/video recording released should include the department name and to whom the record
was released.
804.10 SEALED RECORD ORDERS
Sealed record orders received by the Department shall be reviewed for appropriate action by the
Custodian of Records. The Custodian of Records, or his/her designee, shall seal such records as
ordered by the court. Records may include but are not limited to a record of arrest, investigation,
detention, or conviction. Once the record is sealed, members shall respond to any inquiry as
though the record did not exist (Penal Code § 851.8; Welfare and Institutions Code § 781).
When an arrest record is sealed pursuant to Penal Code § 851.87, Penal Code § 851.90, Penal
Code § 851.91, Penal Code § 1000.4, or Penal Code § 1001.9, the Records Supervisor shall

Upon receiving notice from a probation department to seal juvenile arrest records pursuant to
Welfare and Institutions Code § 786.5, the Records Supervisor should ensure that the records are
sealed within 60 days of that notice and that the probation department is notified once the records
have been sealed (Welfare and Institutions Code § 786.5).
804.11 RELEASE OF AUDIO OR VIDEO RECORDINGS RELATED TO CRITICAL
INCIDENTS
Video and audio recordings related to critical incidents shall be released upon a proper public
record request and subject to delayed release, redaction, and other release restrictions as
provided by law (Government Code § 6254(f)(4)).
For purposes of this section, a video or audio recording relates to a critical incident if it depicts
an incident involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by an officer, or depicts an incident in
which the use of force by an officer against a person resulted in death or in great bodily injury (as
defined by Penal Code § 243(f)(4)) (Government Code § 6254(f)(4)).
The Custodian of Records should work as appropriate with the Chief of Police or the Internal Affairs
Bureau supervisor in determining what recordings may qualify for disclosure when a request for a
recording is received and if the requested recording is subject to delay from disclosure, redaction,
or other release restrictions.

804.11.1 DELAY OF RELEASE
Disclosure of critical incident recordings during active criminal or administrative investigations may
be delayed as follows if disclosure would substantially interfere with the investigation, such as by
endangering the safety of a witness or a confidential source:
(a) Disclosure may be delayed up to 45 days from the date the Department knew or
reasonably should have known about the incident.
(b) Delay of disclosure may continue after the initial 45 days and up to one year if
the Department demonstrates that disclosure would substantially interfere with the
investigation.
(c) Any delay of disclosure longer than one year must be supported by clear and
convincing evidence that disclosure would substantially interfere with the investigation
(Government Code § 6254(f)(4)).
804.11.2 NOTICE OF DELAY OF RELEASE
When there is justification to delay disclosure of a recording, the Custodian of Records shall
provide written notice to the requester as follows (Government Code § 6254(f)(4)):
(a) During the initial 45 days, the Custodian of Records shall provide the requester
with written notice of the specific basis for the determination that disclosure would
substantially interfere with the investigation. The notice shall also include the estimated
date for the disclosure.
(a) When delay is continued after the initial 45 days, the Custodian of Records shall
promptly provide the requester with written notice of the specific basis for the
determination that the interest in preventing interference with an active investigation
outweighs the public interest in the disclosure, and the estimated date for the
disclosure. The Custodian of Records should work with the Chief of Police in
reassessing the decision to continue withholding a recording and notify the requester
every 30 days.
Recordings withheld shall be disclosed promptly when the specific basis for withholding the
recording is resolved.
804.11.3 REDACTION
If the Custodian of Records, in consultation with the Chief of Police or authorized designee,
determines that specific portions of the recording may violate the reasonable expectation of
privacy of a person depicted in the recording, the Department should use redaction technology
to redact portions of recordings made available for release. The redaction should not interfere
with the viewer's ability to fully, completely, and accurately comprehend the events captured in
the recording, and the recording should not otherwise be edited or altered (Government Code §
6254(f)(4)).
If any portions of a recording are withheld to protect the reasonable expectation of privacy of a
person depicted in the recording, the Custodian of Records shall provide in writing to the requester
the specific basis for the expectation of privacy and the public interest served (Government Code
§ 6254(f)(4)).

804.11.4 RECORDINGS WITHHELD FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
If the reasonable expectation of privacy of a person depicted in the recording cannot adequately
be protected through redaction, and that interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure, the
Department may withhold the recording from the public, except that the recording, either redacted
or unredacted, shall be disclosed promptly, upon request, to any of the following (Government
Code § 6254(f)(4)):
(a) The person in the recording whose privacy is to be protected, or his/her authorized
representative.
(b) If the person is a minor, the parent or legal guardian of the person whose privacy is
to be protected.
(c) If the person whose privacy is to be protected is deceased, an heir, beneficiary,
designated immediate family member, or authorized legal representative of the
deceased person whose privacy is to be protected.
If the Department determines that this disclosure would substantially interfere with an active
criminal or administrative investigation, the Custodian of Records shall provide the requester with
written notice of the specific basis for the determination and the estimated date of disclosure
(Government Code § 6254(f)(4)).
The Department may continue to delay release of the recording from the public for 45 days with
extensions as provided in this policy (Government Code § 6254(f)(4)(A)).

805.4 ACCESS TO PROTECTED INFORMATION
Protected information shall not be accessed in violation of any law, order, regulation, user
agreement, Berkeley Police Department policy or training. Only those members who have
completed applicable training and met any applicable requirements, such as a background check,
may access protected information, and only when the member has a legitimate work-related

direct access to CORI (11 CCR 702).
805.5 RELEASE OR DISSEMINATION OF PROTECTED INFORMATION
Protected information may be released only to authorized recipients who have both a right to know
and a need to know.

Protected Information
In cases where the transmission of protected information, such as Personally Identifiable
Information, is necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose, and utilization of
an encrypted radio channel is infeasible, a MDT or department-issued cellular telephone should
be utilized when practicable. If neither are available, unencrypted radio transmissions shall be
subject to the following:
• Elements of protected information should be broken up into multiple transmissions,
to minimally separate an individual’s combined last name and any identifying number
associated with the individual, from either first name or first initial.
• Additional information regarding the individual, including date of birth, home address,
or physical descriptors, should be relayed in separate transmissions.
Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit broadcasting warrant information.

Police and appropriate authorities.
805.6.1 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES
Members accessing or receiving protected information shall ensure the information is not
accessed or received by persons who are not authorized to access or receive it. This includes
leaving protected information, such as documents or computer databases, accessible to others
when it is reasonably foreseeable that unauthorized access may occur (e.g., on an unattended
table or desk; in or on an unattended vehicle; in an unlocked desk drawer or file cabinet; on an
unattended computer terminal).
805.7 CALIFORNIA RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT
Members shall not release personal information from any agency database for the purpose of
investigation or enforcement of any program compiling data on individuals based on religious
belief, practice, affiliation, national origin or ethnicity (Government Code § 8310.3).
805.8 TRAINING
All members authorized to access or release protected information shall complete a training

Computers and Digital Evidence
806.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes procedures for the seizure and storage of computers, personal
communications devices (PCDs) digital cameras, digital recorders and other electronic devices
that are capable of storing digital information; and for the preservation and storage of digital
evidence. All evidence seized and/or processed pursuant to this policy shall be done so in
compliance with clearly established Fourth Amendment and search and seizure provisions.
806.2 SEIZING COMPUTERS AND RELATED EVIDENCE
Computer equipment requires specialized training and handling to preserve its value as evidence.
Officers should be aware of the potential to destroy information through careless or improper
handling, and utilize the most knowledgeable available resources. When seizing a computer and
accessories the following steps should be taken:
(a) Photograph each item, front and back, specifically including cable connections to other
items. Look for a phone line or cable to a modem for Internet access.
(b) Do not overlook the possibility of the presence of physical evidence on and around
the hardware relevant to the particular investigation such as fingerprints, biological or
trace evidence, and/or documents.
(c) If the computer is off, do not turn it on.
(d) If the computer is on, do not shut it down normally and do not click on anything or
examine any files.
1. Photograph the screen, if possible, and note any programs or windows that
appear to be open and running.
2. Disconnect the power cable from the back of the computer box or if a portable
notebook style, disconnect any power cable from the case and remove the
battery).
(e) Label each item with case number, evidence sheet number, and item number.
(f) Handle and transport the computer and storage media (e.g., tape, discs, memory
cards, flash memory, external drives) with care so that potential evidence is not lost.
(g) Book all computer items in the Property Room. Do not store computers where normal
room temperature and humidity is not maintained.
(h) At minimum, officers should document the following in related reports:
1. Where the computer was located and whether or not it was in operation.
2. Who was using it at the time.
3. Who claimed ownership.
4. If it can be determined, how it was being used.
(i) In most cases when a computer is involved in criminal acts and is in the possession
of the suspect, the computer itself, the corresponding power/charging cords, and all

Law Enforcement Manual
Computers and Digital Evidence
storage devices (hard drives, tape drives, and disk drives) should be seized along
with all media. Accessories (printers, monitors, mouse, scanner, keyboard, cables,
software and manuals) should not be seized unless as a precursor to forfeiture.
806.2.1 BUSINESS OR NETWORKED COMPUTERS
If the computer belongs to a business or is part of a network, it may not be feasible to seize the
entire computer. Cases involving networks require specialized handling. Officers should contact a
certified forensic computer examiner for instructions or a response to the scene. It may be possible
to perform an on-site inspection, or to image the hard drive only of the involved computer. This
should only be done by someone specifically trained in processing computers for evidence.
806.2.2 FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF COMPUTERS
If an examination of the contents of the computer’s hard drive, or floppy disks, compact discs, or
any other storage media is required, forward the following items to a computer forensic examiner:
(a) Copy of report(s) involving the computer, including the Evidence/Property sheet.
(b) Copy of a consent to search form signed by the computer owner or the person in
possession of the computer, or a copy of a search warrant authorizing the search of
the computer hard drive for evidence relating to investigation.
(c) A listing of the items to search for (e.g., photographs, financial records, e-mail,
documents).
(d) When necessary, an exact duplicate of the hard drive or disk will be made using
a forensic computer and a forensic software program by someone trained in the
examination of computer storage devices for evidence.
806.3 SEIZING DIGITAL STORAGE MEDIA
Digital storage media including hard drives, floppy discs, CD’s, DVD’s, tapes, memory cards, or
flash memory devices should be seized and stored in a manner that will protect them from damage.
(a) If the media has a write-protection tab or switch, it should be activated.
(b) In general, do not review, access or open digital files prior to submission. If the
information is needed for immediate investigation request the Property Room to copy
the contents to an appropriate form of storage media.
(c) Many kinds of storage media can be erased or damaged by magnetic fields. Keep
all media away from magnetic devices, electric motors, radio transmitters or other
sources of magnetic fields.
(d) Do not leave storage media where they would be subject to excessive heat such as
in a parked vehicle on a hot day.
(e) Use plastic cases designed to protect the media, or other protective packaging, to
prevent damage.

806.4 SEIZING PCDS
Personal communication devices such as cell phones, PDAs or other hand-held devices
connected to any communication network must be handled with care to preserve evidence that
may be on the device including messages, stored data and/or images.
(a) Officers should not attempt to access, review or search the contents of such devices
prior to examination by a forensic expert. Unsent messages can be lost, data can be
inadvertently deleted and incoming messages can override stored messages.
(b) Do not turn the device on or off. The device should be placed in a faraday bag, to
prevent the device from sending or receiving information from its host network.
(c) When seizing the devices, also seize the charging units and keep them plugged in
to the chargers until they can be examined. If the batteries go dead all the data may
be lost.
806.5 DIGITAL EVIDENCE RECORDED BY OFFICERS
Officers handling and submitting recorded and digitally stored evidence from digital cameras and
audio or video recorders will comply with these procedures to ensure the integrity and admissibility
of such evidence.
806.5.1 COLLECTION OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE
Once evidence is recorded it shall not be erased, deleted or altered in any way prior to submission.
All photographs taken will be preserved regardless of quality, composition or relevance. Video
and audio files will not be altered in any way.
806.5.2 SUBMISSION OF DIGITAL MEDIA
The following are required procedures for the submission of digital media used by cameras or
other recorders:
(a) The recording media (smart card, compact flash card or any other media) shall be
booked into the Property Room as soon as possible for submission into evidence, or
(b) The media on the card shall be uploaded to the Department's Digital Evidence
Database or an alternative storage media as soon as possible for submission into
evidence.
806.5.3 DOWNLOADING OF DIGITAL FILES

either downloaded to storage media or uploaded to the Department's Digital Evidence Database.
806.5.4 PRESERVATION OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE
(a) Digital images that are enhanced to provide a better quality photograph for
identification and investigative purposes must only be made from a copy of the original
media.
(b) If any enhancement is done to the copy of the original, it shall be noted in the
corresponding incident report.

The jailer responsible for a detainee in temporary custody shall (15 CCR 1050):
(a) Advise the Jail Supervisor of any significant risks presented by the individual (e.g.,
suicide risk, health risk, violence).
(b) Evaluate the following issues against the stated risks in (a) to determine the need for
placing the individual in a single cell:
1. Consider whether the individual may be at a high risk of being sexually abused
based on all available known information (28 CFR 115.141), or whether the
person is facing any other identified risk.
2. Provide any individual identified as being at a high risk for sexual or other
victimization with heightened protection. This may include (28 CFR 115.113; 28
CFR 115.141):
i. Continuous, direct sight and sound supervision.
3. Ensure individuals are separated according to severity of the crime (e.g., felony
or misdemeanor).
4. Ensure males and females are separated by sight when in cells.
5. Ensure restrained individuals are not placed in cells with unrestrained
individuals.
(c) Ensure that those confined under civil process or for civil causes are kept separate
from those who are in temporary custody pending criminal charges.
(d) Ensure separation, as appropriate, based on other factors, such as age, criminal
sophistication, assaultive/non-assaultive behavior, mental state, disabilities and
sexual orientation.
(e) Ensure detainees who are extremely dirty and refuse to shower subsequent to booking
are housed separately.
(f) Ensure persons who suffer from a loss of hearing which does not present an

(not including a Conducted Energy Device) such as a baton round, diversion device,
etc. or non-lethal device such as a Rapid Containment Baton (RCB), OC spray, etc. in
the course of their apprehension has been evaluated for injury by the arresting officer
prior to booking into the Jail. (See section 900.5 and 900.10 regarding detainees who
have been exposed to Conducted Energy Devices).
900.14 SERVICE ANIMALS
(a) A service animal is defined as a dog that is trained to do work or perform tasks for
the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric,
intellectual or other mental disability. The work or tasks performed by a service animal
must be directly related to the individual's disability (28 CFR 35.104; Health and Safety
Code § 113903).
1. A service animal also includes a miniature horse if the horse is trained to do work
or perform tasks for people with disabilities, provided the horse is housebroken,
is under the handler’s control, the facility can accommodate the horse’s type,
size and weight, and the horse’s presence will not compromise legitimate safety
requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility (28 CFR 35.136(i)) (see
the Service Animal Policy for further).
(b) Jail staff shall consider a request from a detainee for their service animal to be present
with him/her while confined in the Jail. The employee considering the request shall
be responsible for making permissible inquiries to determine the status of the alleged
service animal and suitability for entry into the Jail.
(c) If the animal doesn’t qualify as a service animal, the detainee may make arrangements
for the animal’s care. If this cannot be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time,
the animal should be delivered to Animal Control. The detainee shall be notified of
their animal’s location.
(d) If the animal qualifies as a service animal, but the animal would jeopardize the safe
operation of the jail or would pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others, the
animal may be separated from the detainee. The detainee may make arrangements
for the animal’s care. If this cannot be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time,
the animal should be delivered to Animal Control. The detainee shall be notified of
their animal’s location.
(e) If the animal needs to be separated from the detainee, the employee shall ask the
detainee if separation from the service animal would constitute or create a medical
emergency. If the detainee claims the separation will constitute or create a medical
emergency, the detainee should be taken to a hospital facility for medical clearance.
(f) If the animal is determined to qualify as a service animal, the detainee must be able to
care for (i.e., feed and clean) the animal, or provide an attendant who can come to the
Jail to accomplish the same care. The detainee must also agree to ensure the animal’s
transfer from the Jail no later than four hours prior to the detainee’s transfer to court
or other facility. If the detainee cannot accomplish these things, the animal will not be
allowed into the Jail. The detainee may then make arrangements for the animal’s care.

Custodial Searches
901.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidance regarding searches of individuals in custody. Such searches are
necessary to eliminate the introduction of contraband, intoxicants or weapons into the Berkeley
Police Department facility. Such items can pose a serious risk to the safety and security of

Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit the otherwise lawful collection of evidence from an
individual in custody.
901.1.1 DEFINITIONS

clothing, including pockets, cuffs and folds on the clothing, to remove all weapons, dangerous
items and contraband.

to fit typical definitions of male or female. Intersex medical conditions are sometimes referred to
as disorders of sex development (28 CFR 115.5).

a physical intrusion into a body cavity. Body cavity means the stomach or rectal cavity of an
individual, and the vagina of a female person.

outer genitalia. This includes monitoring an individual who is changing clothes, where his/her
underclothing, buttocks, genitalia or female breasts are visible.

upon request to the individual or the individual’s authorized representative.
(j) Strip searches involving transgender persons: All searches of the transgender
inmate's person will be done by two officers of the gender requested by the
transgender inmate. If the inmate does not specify a preference, then the search will be
done by officers of the same gender as the transgender inmate's gender presentation
(e.g., a female-to-male (FTM) inmate expressing no preference should be searched
by a male officer). If gender presentation or identity is not clear to the inmate, the
inmate will be searched by one female and one male officer.
(k) If a person refuses to comply with a request for a visual body cavity search, the above
“no touching” rule still applies. To require cooperation, the officer may either obtain
a search warrant, not perform the search, or transfer the person to a higher security
facility (Santa Rita Jail) as an uncooperative prisoner.
901.5.2 SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE FIELD STRIP SEARCHES

shall review the investigation and determine whether any allegations of sexual abuse or sexual
harassment have been substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence (28 CFR 115.172).
All personnel shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions up to and including termination for violating
this policy. Termination shall be the presumptive disciplinary sanction for department members
who have engaged in sexual abuse. All discipline shall be commensurate with the nature and
circumstances of the acts committed, the member’s disciplinary history and the sanctions imposed
for comparable offenses by other members with similar histories (28 CFR 115.176).
All terminations for violations of this policy, or resignations by members who would have been
terminated if not for their resignation, shall be criminally investigated unless the activity was clearly
not criminal and reported to any relevant licensing body (28 CFR 115.176).
Any contractor or volunteer who engages in sexual abuse shall be prohibited from contact with
detainees and reported to any relevant licensing bodies (28 CFR 115.177). The Chief of Police
shall take appropriate remedial measures and consider whether to prohibit further contact with
detainees by a contractor or volunteer.
902.6 RETALIATION PROHIBITED
All detainees and members who report sexual abuse or sexual harassment or who cooperate
with sexual abuse or sexual harassment investigations shall be protected from retaliation (28
CFR 115.167). If any other individual who cooperates with an investigation expresses a fear of
retaliation, appropriate measures shall be taken to protect that individual.
The Support Services Lieutenant or the authorized designee shall employ multiple protection
measures, such as housing changes or transfers for detainee victims or abusers, removal of
alleged abusers from contact with victims, and emotional support services for detainees or
members who fear retaliation for reporting sexual abuse or sexual harassment or for cooperating
with investigations.
The Support Services Lieutenant or the authorized designee shall identify a staff member to
monitor the conduct and treatment of detainees or members who have reported sexual abuse
and of detainees who were reported to have suffered sexual abuse. The staff member shall act
promptly to remedy any such retaliation. In the case of detainees, such monitoring shall also
include periodic status checks.
902.7 REVIEWS AND AUDITS
902.7.1 INCIDENT REVIEWS

identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex identification, status or
perceived status; gang affiliation; or was motivated or otherwise caused by other group
dynamics at the facility.

whether physical barriers in the area may enable abuse.
(d) Assess the adequacy of staffing levels in that area during different shifts.
(e) Assess whether monitoring technology should be deployed or augmented to
supplement supervision by staff.
The review team shall prepare a report of its findings, including any determinations made pursuant
to this section and any recommendations for improvement. The report shall be submitted to the
Chief of Police and the PREA Coordinator. The Chief of Police or the authorized designee shall
implement the recommendations for improvement or shall document the reasons for not doing
so (28 CFR 115.186).
902.7.2 DATA REVIEWS
The facility shall conduct an annual review of collected and aggregated incident-based sexual
abuse data. The review should include, as needed, data from incident-based documents, including
reports, investigation files and sexual abuse incident reviews (28 CFR 115.187).

through the department website or, if it does not have one, through other means. Material may be
redacted from the reports when publication would present a clear and specific threat to the safety
and security of the Jail. However, the nature of the redacted material shall be indicated.
All aggregated sexual abuse data from Berkeley Police Department facilities and private facilities
with which it contracts shall be made readily available to the public at least annually through the

Grievance Procedure
1003.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
It is the policy of this department that all grievances be handled quickly and fairly without
discrimination against employees who file a grievance whether or not there is a basis for the
grievance. Our Department’s philosophy is to promote a free verbal communication between
employees and supervisors.
1003.1.1 GRIEVANCE DEFINED
A grievance is any difference of opinion concerning terms or conditions of employment or the
dispute involving the interpretation or application of any of the following documents by the
person(s) affected:
• The employee bargaining agreement (Memorandum of Understanding)
• This Policy Manual
• City rules and regulations covering personnel practices or working conditions
Grievances may be brought by an individual affected employee or by a group representative.
Specifically outside the category of grievance are complaints related to allegations of
discrimination or harassment subject to the Discriminatory Harassment Policy. Also outside the
category of grievances are personnel complaints regarding any allegation of misconduct or
improper job performance against any department employee that, if true, would constitute a
violation of department policy, federal, state, or local law as set forth in the Personnel Complaint
Policy.
1003.2 PROCEDURE
Except as otherwise required under a collective bargaining agreement, if an employee believes
that he or she has a grievance as defined above, then that employee shall observe the following
procedure:
(a) Attempt to resolve the issue through informal discussion with immediate supervisor.
(b) If after a reasonable amount of time, generally seven days, the grievance cannot be
settled by the immediate supervisor, the employee may request an interview with the
Division Captain of the affected division or bureau.
(c) If a successful resolution is not found with the Division Captain, the employee may
request a meeting with the Chief of Police.
(d) If the employee and the Chief of Police are unable to arrive at a mutual solution, then
the employee shall proceed as follows:
1. Submit in writing a written statement of the grievance and deliver one copy to
the Chief of Police and another copy to the immediate supervisor and include
the following information:
(a) The basis for the grievance (i.e., what are the facts of the case?).

Grievance Procedure
(b) Allegation of the specific wrongful act and the harm done.
(c) The specific policies, rules or regulations that were violated.
(d) What remedy or goal is being sought by this grievance.
(e) The employee shall receive a copy of the acknowledgment signed by the supervisor
including the date and time of receipt.
(f) The Chief of Police will receive the grievance in writing. The Chief of Police and the City
Manager will review and analyze the facts or allegations and respond to the employee
within 14 calendar days. The response will be in writing, and will affirm or deny the
allegations. The response shall include any remedies if appropriate. The decision of
the City Manager is considered final.
1003.3 EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION
Employees are entitled to have representation during the grievance process. The representative
may be selected by the employee from the appropriate employee bargaining group.
1003.4 GRIEVANCE RECORDS

Anti-Retaliation
1004.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy prohibits retaliation against members who identify workplace issues, such as fraud,
waste, abuse of authority, gross mismanagement or any inappropriate conduct or practices,
including violations that may pose a threat to the health, safety or well-being of members.
This policy does not prohibit actions taken for nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reasons, such
as discipline for cause.
These guidelines are intended to supplement and not limit members’ access to other applicable
remedies. Nothing in this policy shall diminish the rights or remedies of a member pursuant to
any applicable federal law, provision of the U.S. Constitution, law, ordinance or memorandum of
understanding.
1004.2 POLICY
The Berkeley Police Department has a zero tolerance for retaliation and is committed to taking
reasonable steps to protect from retaliation members who, in good faith, engage in permitted
behavior or who report or participate in the reporting or investigation of workplace issues. All
complaints of retaliation will be taken seriously and will be promptly and appropriately investigated.
1004.3 RETALIATION PROHIBITED
No member may retaliate against any person for engaging in lawful or otherwise permitted
behavior; for opposing a practice believed to be unlawful, unethical, discriminatory or retaliatory;
for reporting or making a complaint under this policy; or for participating in any investigation related
to a complaint under this or any other policy.
Retaliation includes any adverse action or conduct, including but not limited to:
• Refusing to hire or denying a promotion.
• Extending the probationary period.
• Unjustified reassignment of duties or change of work schedule.
• Real or implied threats or other forms of intimidation to dissuade the reporting of
wrongdoing or filing of a complaint, or as a consequence of having reported or
participated in protected activity.
• Taking unwarranted disciplinary action.
• Spreading rumors about the person filing the complaint or about the alleged
wrongdoing.
• Shunning or unreasonably avoiding a person because he/she has engaged in
protected activity.

Law Enforcement Manual
Anti-Retaliation
1004.3.1 RETALIATION PROHIBITED FOR REPORTING VIOLATIONS
An officer shall not be retaliated against for reporting a suspected violation of a law or regulation
of another officer to a supervisor or other person in the Department who has the authority to
investigate the violation (Government Code § 7286(b)).
1004.4 COMPLAINTS OF RETALIATION
Any member who feels he/she has been retaliated against in violation of this policy should
promptly report the matter to any supervisor, command staff member, Chief of Police or the City
Professional Standards Division Captain.
Members shall act in good faith, not engage in unwarranted reporting of trivial or minor deviations
or transgressions, and make reasonable efforts to verify facts before making any complaint in order
to avoid baseless allegations. Members shall not report or state an intention to report information
or an allegation knowing it to be false, with willful or reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of
the information or otherwise act in bad faith.
Investigations are generally more effective when the identity of the reporting member is known,
thereby allowing investigators to obtain additional information from the reporting member.
However, complaints may be made anonymously. All reasonable efforts shall be made to protect
the reporting member’s identity. However, confidential information may be disclosed to the extent
required by law or to the degree necessary to conduct an adequate investigation and make a
determination regarding a complaint. In some situations, the investigative process may not be
complete unless the source of the information and a statement by the member is part of the
investigative process.
1004.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
Supervisors are expected to remain familiar with this policy and ensure that members under their
command are aware of its provisions.
The responsibilities of supervisors include, but are not limited to:
(a) Ensuring complaints of retaliation are investigated as provided in the Personnel
Complaints Policy.
(b) Receiving all complaints in a fair and impartial manner.
(c) Documenting the complaint and any steps taken to resolve the problem.
(d) Acknowledging receipt of the complaint, notifying the Chief of Police via the chain of
command and explaining to the member how the complaint will be handled.
(e) Taking appropriate and reasonable steps to mitigate any further violations of this
policy.
(f) Monitoring the work environment to ensure that any member making a complaint is
not subjected to further retaliation.
(g) Periodic follow-up with the complainant to ensure that retaliation is not continuing.

(h) Not interfering with or denying the right of a member to make any complaint.
(i) Taking reasonable steps to accommodate requests for assignment or schedule
changes made by a member who may be the target of retaliation if it would likely
mitigate the potential for further violations of this policy.
1004.6 COMMAND STAFF RESPONSIBILITIES
The Chief of Police should communicate to all supervisors the prohibition against retaliation.
Command staff shall treat all complaints as serious matters and shall ensure that prompt actions
take place, including but not limited to:
(a) Communicating to all members the prohibition against retaliation.
(b) The timely review of complaint investigations.
(c) Remediation of any inappropriate conduct or condition and instituting measures to
eliminate or minimize the likelihood of recurrence.
(d) The timely communication of the outcome to the complainant.

California law protects members who (Labor Code § 1102.5; Government Code § 53296 et seq.):
(a) Report a violation of a state or federal statute or regulation to a government or law
enforcement agency, including the member’s supervisor or any other member with the
authority to investigate the reported violation.
(b) Provide information or testify before a public body if the member has reasonable cause
to believe a violation of law occurred.
(c) Refuse to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a state or federal
statute or regulation.
(d) File a complaint with a local agency about gross mismanagement or a significant waste
of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or
safety. Members shall exhaust all available administrative remedies prior to filing a
formal complaint.
(e) Are family members of a person who has engaged in any protected acts described
above.
Members are encouraged to report any legal violations through the chain of command (Labor
Code § 1102.5).
Members who believe they have been the subject of retaliation for engaging in such protected
behaviors should promptly report it to a supervisor. Supervisors should refer the complaint to the
Internal Affairs Bureau for investigation pursuant to the Personnel Complaints Policy.

Reporting of Employee Convictions
1005.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Convictions of certain offenses may restrict or prohibit an employee’s ability to properly perform
official duties. Therefore, all employees shall be required to promptly notify the Department of any
past and current criminal convictions.
The Professional Standards Division shall submit in a timely manner a notice to the Commission
on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) of any appointment, termination, reinstatement,
name change or status change regarding any peace officer, reserve peace officer, public safety
dispatcher and records supervisor employed by this department (11 CCR 1003).
The Professional Standards Division shall submit in a timely manner a notice to POST of a
felony conviction or Government Code § 1029 reason that disqualifies any current peace officer
employed by this department or any former peace officer if this department was responsible for
the investigation (11 CCR 1003).
1005.2 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTIONS, OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND
RESTRAINING ORDERS
California and federal law prohibit individuals convicted of, or having an outstanding warrant for,
certain offenses and individuals subject to certain court orders from lawfully possessing a firearm.
Such convictions and court orders often involve allegations of the use or attempted use of force or
threatened use of a weapon on any individual in a domestic relationship (e.g., spouse, cohabitant,
parent, child) (18 USC § 922; Penal Code § 29805).
All members are responsible for ensuring that they have not been disqualified from possessing
a firearm by any such conviction or court order and shall promptly report any such conviction or
court order to a supervisor, as provided in this policy.
1005.3 OTHER CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND COURT ORDERS
Government Code § 1029 prohibits any person convicted of a felony from being a peace officer
in the State of California. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the guilt was established
by way of a verdict, guilty, or nolo contendere plea.
Convictions of certain violations of the Vehicle Code and other provisions of law may also place
restrictions on an employee’s ability to fully perform the duties of the job.
Outstanding warrants as provided in Penal Code § 29805 also place restrictions on a member’s
ability to possess a firearm.
Moreover, while legal restrictions may or may not be imposed by statute or by the courts upon
conviction of any criminal offense, criminal conduct by members of this department may be
inherently in conflict with law enforcement duties and the public trust.

Reporting of Employee Convictions
1005.4 REPORTING PROCEDURE
All members of this department and all retired officers with an identification card issued by the
Department shall promptly notify their immediate supervisor (or the Chief of Police in the case of
retired officers) in writing of any past or current criminal arrest, outstanding warrant or conviction
regardless of whether or not the matter is currently on appeal and regardless of the penalty or
sentence, if any.
All members and all retired officers with an identification card issued by the Department shall
further promptly notify their immediate supervisor (or the Chief of Police in the case of retired
officers) in writing if the member or retiree becomes the subject of a domestic violence restraining
order or similar court order or becomes the subject of an outstanding warrant.
Any member whose criminal conviction unduly restricts or prohibits that member from fully and
properly performing his/her duties may be disciplined including, but not limited to, being placed on
administrative leave, reassignment and/or termination. Any effort to remove such disqualification
or restriction shall remain entirely the responsibility of the member on his/her own time and
expense.
Any member failing to provide prompt written notice pursuant to this policy shall be subject to
discipline.
1005.5 PROCEDURE FOR RELIEF
Pursuant to Penal Code § 29855, a peace officer may petition the court for permission to carry
a firearm following a conviction under state law. Federal law, however, does not provide for any
such similar judicial relief and the granting of a state court petition under Penal Code § 29855
will not relieve one of the restrictions imposed by federal law. Therefore, relief for any employee
falling under the restrictions imposed by federal law may only be obtained by expungement of the
conviction. Employees shall seek relief from firearm restrictions on their own time and through
their own resources.
Pursuant to Family Code § 6389(h), an individual may petition the court for an exemption to any
restraining order, which would thereafter permit the individual to carry a firearm or ammunition as
a part of the individual's employment. Relief from any domestic violence or other restriction shall
also be pursued through the employee’s own resources and on the employee’s own time.
Pending satisfactory proof of relief from any legal restriction imposed on an employee’s duties,
the employee may be placed on administrative leave, reassigned, or disciplined. The Department
may, but is not required to return an employee to any assignment, reinstate any employee, or
reverse any pending or imposed discipline upon presentation of satisfactory proof of relief from
any legal restriction set forth in this policy.

Sick Leave
1007.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides general guidance regarding the use and processing of sick leave. The accrual
and terms of use of sick leave for eligible employees are detailed in the City personnel manual
or applicable collective bargaining agreement.
This policy is not intended to cover all types of sick or other leaves. For example, employees may
be entitled to additional paid or unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons as provided
for in the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (29 USC § 2601 et seq.) and the California Family
Rights Act, and leave related to domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking or for organ or bone
marrow donor procedures (29 CFR 825; Government Code § 12945.2; Labor Code § 230.1; Labor
Code § 1510).
1007.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to provide eligible employees with a sick leave
benefit.
1007.3 USE OF SICK LEAVE
Sick leave is intended to be used for qualified absences. Sick leave is not considered vacation.
Abuse of sick leave may result in discipline, denial of sick leave benefits, or both.
Employees on sick leave shall not engage in other employment or self-employment or participate
in any sport, hobby, recreational activity or other activity that may impede recovery from the injury
or illness (see Outside Employment Policy).
Qualified appointments should be scheduled during a member’s non-working hours when it is
reasonable to do so.
1007.3.1 NOTIFICATION
All members should notify the Watch Commander or appropriate supervisor as soon as they are
aware that they will not be able to report to work and no less than one hour before the start of their
scheduled shifts. If, due to an emergency, a member is unable to contact the supervisor, every
effort should be made to have a representative for the member contact the supervisor (Labor
Code § 246 ).
When the necessity to be absent from work is foreseeable, such as planned medical appointments
or treatments, the member shall, whenever possible and practicable, provide the Department with
no less than 30 days' notice of the impending absence (Labor Code § 246).
Upon return to work, members are responsible for ensuring their time off was appropriately
accounted for, and for completing and submitting the required documentation describing the type
of time off used and the specific amount of time taken.
1007.4 REQUIRED NOTICES
The Professional Standards Division Captain shall ensure:

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Sick Leave
(a) Written notice of the amount of paid sick leave available is provided to employees as
provided in Labor Code § 246.
(b) A poster is displayed in a conspicuous place for employees to review that contains
information on paid sick leave as provided in Labor Code § 247.
1007.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of supervisors include, but are not limited to:
(a) Monitoring and regularly reviewing the attendance of those under their command to
ensure that the use of sick leave and absences is consistent with this policy.
1. Single or multiple uses of sick leave having an identifiable pattern (i.e., taken in
conjunction with days off, holidays or vacation), or a questionable explanation
provided by the employee, may be deemed abusive.
(b) Attempting to determine whether an absence of four or more days may qualify as family
medical leave and consulting the Personnel and Training Bureau as appropriate.
(c) Addressing absences and sick leave use in the member’s performance evaluation
when excessive or unusual use has:
1. Negatively affected the member’s performance or ability to complete assigned
duties; or
2. Negatively affected department operations.
(d) When appropriate, counseling members regarding excessive absences and/or
inappropriate use of sick leave.
(e) Referring eligible members to an available employee assistance program when
appropriate.
1007.6 PHYSICIAN VERIFICATION - EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES
In order to ensure appropriate medical care, the supervisor may require the employee to submit a
“physician verification” each time the employee is absent due to an apparent illness and/or injury.
(a) A “physician verification” shall, at minimum, include the following information:
1. The date and time the employee went to see the physician;
2. A statement that a physician treated the employee, and that the physician
determined that the employee was in fact ill and/or injured on the date of the
absence;
3. A return to work date; and,
4. Whether or not the employee is able to fully perform his/her normal assigned
duties.
(b) A “physician verification” may also be required in cases of excessive absence due to

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Sick Leave
An employee’s failure to provide a required “physician verification” may result in the modification
of his/her attendance record from “Sick Leave” to “Unauthorized Leave Without Pay”, and may
result in disciplinary action.
1007.7 ATTENDANCE MONITORING
When a supervisor observes a single absence, or pattern of absences, that may be consistent
with an abuse of sick leave, or the use of more than half of the employee’s sick leave accrual for
the preceding twelve month period, he/she shall review the associated absence report record(s)
to evaluate the reason(s) provided for the absence(s) of concern.
The supervisor shall advise the subject employee of the specific absence(s) in question and
circumstances which revealed the issue, and determine if there was a valid reason for the
absence(s) of concern.
In the event an employee provides a reasonable explanation for unplanned and/or seemingly
excessive uses of sick leave (e.g., an employee’s care for him/herself or a family member
regarding a serious medical condition), and where there is anticipation of a related future absence,
the supervisor may recommend the employee apply for benefits provided by the Federal Family
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the City of Berkeley Employee Assistance Program (ref.
City of Berkeley Administrative Regulation 2.4).
If the employee’s explanation for the subject absence(s) reveals a violation of this policy, or is
questionable or inadequate, the supervisor shall counsel the employee against abusive use of
sick leave and admonish him/her regarding possible disciplinary action should future abuse occur.
The supervisor may also initiate a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) as a mechanism to
monitor an employee’s attendance and use of sick leave.
The supervisor should inform the employee of their right to administrative representation at future
progress report meetings, as any subsequent violation(s) of this policy could lead to discipline.
1007.7.1 FOLLOW-UP
Following the initial counseling meeting, the supervisor shall review the relevant attendance
records with the employee every 30 days for a period of six months.
(a) If an abuse of sick leave does not recur in the six month period following the initial
counseling meeting, the supervisor shall inform the employee that his/her attendance
will be reviewed quarterly for, at minimum, six months.
(b) Attendance monitoring authorized by this policy, whether informal or as part of a PIP,
will remain in effect no more than one year from the date of the initial counseling
meeting, unless continued monitoring is necessary.
If during the six month monitoring period there is another incident of sick leave abuse, the
supervisor shall document the matter as a formal personnel complaint and advise the employee:
1. If not already initiated, a PIP will be instituted and administrative monitoring will
continue for a period of one year; and,
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Sick Leave - 739
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Sick Leave
2. The failure to correct substandard performance with regard to sick time abuse may
result in disciplinary action as prescribed in the Personnel Complaints Policy.
Upon the conclusion of an attendance monitoring program, the supervisor shall inform the subject
employee and advise him/her that their attendance will be routinely reviewed in accordance with
this policy.
1007.8 ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTATION
The supervisor shall provide a written summary, in memorandum form, of the initial counseling
session, including any corrective action plan implemented, to the employee for their review.
(a) The employee shall initial the supervisor’s memorandum as acknowledgement that
he/she reviewed its contents.
(b) An employee who disagrees with the content of, or wishes to provide additional
information to, the supervisor’s memorandum may submit to the supervisor their own
memorandum containing such information.
The supervisor will submit the reviewed and initialed summary memorandum, and all attachments,
to the Division Captain via the chain of command.
In accordance with the Performance Appraisal Report Policy, the supervisor responsible for the
completion of a PAR for an employee counseled and monitored for suspected or confirmed
inappropriate use of sick leave shall include within the PAR a summary of the administrative review
that identified the issue and outcome of the associated performance improvement process.

Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department Blood Testing - 744Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Communicable Diseases & Procedure for Blood Testing
(a) Obtaining consent from the individual.
(b) Complying with the statutory scheme of Health and Safety Code § 121060. This
includes seeking consent from the person who was the source of the exposure and
seeking a court order if consent is not given.
(c) Testing the exposed member for evidence of a communicable disease and seeking
consent from the source individual to either access existing blood samples for testing
or for the source to submit to testing (Health and Safety Code § 120262).
(d) Taking reasonable steps to immediately contact the County Health Officer and provide
preliminary information regarding the circumstances of the exposure and the status
of the involved individuals to determine whether the County Health Officer will order
testing (Penal Code § 7510).
(e) Under certain circumstances, a court may issue a search warrant for the purpose of
HIV testing a person when the exposed member qualifies as a crime victim (Penal
Code § 1524.1).
Since there is the potential for overlap between the different manners in which source testing may
occur, the DICO is responsible for coordinating the testing to prevent unnecessary or duplicate
testing.
The DICO should seek the consent of the individual for testing and consult the City Attorney to
discuss other options when no statute exists for compelling the source of an exposure to undergo
testing if he/she refuses.

1010.11.1 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES
The following applies to members covered by the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights
Act (POBR) (Government Code § 3303):
(a) Interviews of an accused member shall be conducted during reasonable hours and
preferably when the member is on-duty. If the member is off-duty, he/she shall be
compensated.
(b) Unless waived by the member, interviews of an accused member shall be at the
Berkeley Police Department or other reasonable and appropriate place.
(c) No more than two interviewers should ask questions of an accused member.
(d) Prior to any interview, a member shall be informed of the nature of the investigation, the
name, rank and command of the officer in charge of the investigation, the interviewing
officers and all other persons to be present during the interview.
(e) All interviews shall be for a reasonable period and the member's personal needs
should be accommodated.
(f) No member should be subjected to offensive or threatening language, nor shall any
promises, rewards or other inducements be used to obtain answers.
(g) Any member refusing to answer questions directly related to the investigation may
be ordered to answer questions administratively and may be subject to discipline for
failing to do so.
1. A member should be given an order to answer questions in an administrative
investigation that might incriminate the member in a criminal matter only after
the member has been given a Lybarger advisement. Administrative investigators
should consider the impact that compelling a statement from the member
may have on any related criminal investigation and should take reasonable

Law Enforcement Manual
Personnel Complaints
steps to avoid creating any foreseeable conflicts between the two related
investigations. This may include conferring with the person in charge of the
criminal investigation (e.g., discussion of processes, timing, implications).
2. No information or evidence administratively coerced from a member may be
provided to anyone involved in conducting the criminal investigation or to any
prosecutor.
(h) The interviewer should record all interviews of members and witnesses. The member
may also record the interview. If the member has been previously interviewed, a copy
of that recorded interview shall be provided to the member prior to any subsequent
interview.
(i) All members subjected to interviews that could result in discipline have the right to
have an uninvolved representative present during the interview. However, in order
to maintain the integrity of each individual’s statement, involved members shall not
consult or meet with a representative or attorney collectively or in groups prior to being
interviewed.
(j) All members shall provide complete and truthful responses to questions posed during
interviews.
(k) No member may be requested or compelled to submit to a polygraph examination,
nor shall any refusal to submit to such examination be mentioned in any investigation
(Government Code § 3307). This shall not preclude IAB from administering such tests
at the request of a "subject" member, following approval by the Chief of Police.
(l) Members may be photographed for purposes of a complaint investigation. This is to
include photographing for purposes of formation/presentation of a photo line-up by
Internal Affairs investigators.
(m) Members shall not be required to stand in a physical line-up for the purpose of
complaint investigations.
No investigation shall be undertaken against any officer solely because the officer has been placed
on a prosecutor’s Brady list or the name of the officer may otherwise be subject to disclosure
pursuant to Brady v. Maryland. However, an investigation may be based on the underlying acts
or omissions for which the officer has been placed on a Brady list or may otherwise be subject to
disclosure pursuant to Brady v. Maryland (Government Code § 3305.5).
1010.11.2 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION FORMAT
Formal investigations of personnel complaints shall be thorough, complete and essentially follow
this format:
Summary - Provide a brief summary of the facts giving rise to the investigation.
Allegations - List the allegations separately, including applicable policy sections.
Statements - Comprehensive summaries of member and witness statements.
Investigator Notes - Other evidence related to the complaint should be detailed in this section.

Attachments - A separate list of exhibits (e.g., recordings, photos, documents) should be attached
to the report.
1010.11.3 DISPOSITIONS
Each personnel complaint shall be classified with one of the following dispositions:
Unfounded - When the investigation discloses that the alleged acts did not occur or did not
involve department members. Complaints that are determined to be frivolous will fall within the
classification of unfounded (Penal Code § 832.8).
Exonerated - When the investigation discloses that the alleged act occurred but that the act was
justified, lawful and/or proper.
Not sustained - When the investigation discloses that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the
complaint or fully exonerate the member.
Sustained - A final determination by an investigating agency, commission, board, hearing officer,
or arbitrator, as applicable, following an investigation and opportunity for an administrative appeal
pursuant to Government Code § 3304 and Government Code § 3304.5 that the actions of an
officer were found to violate law or department policy (Penal Code § 832.8).
If an investigation discloses misconduct or improper job performance that was not alleged in
the original complaint, the investigator shall take appropriate action with regard to any additional
allegations.
1010.11.4 COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATIONS
Every investigator or supervisor assigned to investigate a personnel complaint or other alleged
misconduct shall proceed with due diligence in an effort to complete the investigation. Investigators
or supervisor assigned to investigate these complaints should be mindful that the investigation,
Board of Review, the Chief's initial decision, and employee notification should be completed within
240 days from the date of discovery by an individual authorized to initiate an investigation (BPA/
COB MOU#37.4).
In the event that an investigation and subsequent processes cannot be completed within 240 days
of discovery, the assigned investigator or supervisor shall ensure that an extension or delay is
warranted within the exceptions set forth in Government Code § 3304(d) or Government Code
§ 3508.1.

with the member’s consent, with a valid search warrant or where the member has been given
reasonable notice that the search will take place (Government Code § 3309).

The Chief of Police shall be notified as soon as practicable when a member is accused of criminal
conduct. The Chief of Police may request a criminal investigation by an outside law enforcement
agency.
A member accused of criminal conduct shall be advised of his/her constitutional rights
(Government Code § 3303(h)). The member should not be administratively ordered to provide

response, the Chief of Police shall consider all information received in regard to the recommended
discipline. The Chief of Police shall render a timely written decision to the member and specify
the grounds and reasons for discipline and the effective date of the discipline. Once the Chief of
Police has issued a written decision, the discipline shall become effective.
1010.16 NOTICE OF FINAL DISPOSITION TO THE COMPLAINANT
The Chief of Police or his/her authorized designee shall ensure that the complainant is notified
of the disposition (i.e., sustained, not sustained, exonerated, unfounded) of the complaint (Penal

through the chain of command. The Department shall remove any such item if appropriate, or

1013.13 RELEASE OF PERSONNEL RECORDS AND RECORDS RELATED TO CERTAIN
INCIDENTS, COMPLAINTS, AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OFFICERS
Personnel records and records related to certain incidents, complaints, and investigations of
officers shall be released pursuant to a proper request under the Public Records Act and subject
to redaction and delayed release as provided by law.
The Custodian of Records should work as appropriate with the Chief of Police or the Internal
Affairs Bureau supervisor in determining what records may qualify for disclosure when a request
for records is received and if the requested record is subject to redaction or delay from disclosure.
For purposes of this section, a record includes (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(3):
• All investigation reports.
• Photographic, audio, and video evidence.
• Transcripts or recordings of interviews.
• Autopsy reports.
• All materials compiled and presented for review to the District Attorney or to any person
or body charged with determining whether to file criminal charges against an officer in
connection with an incident, whether the officer’s action was consistent with law and
department policy for purposes of discipline or administrative action, or what discipline
to impose or corrective action to take.
• Documents setting forth findings or recommending findings.
• Copies of disciplinary records relating to the incident, including any letters of intent
to impose discipline, any documents reflecting modifications of discipline due to the
Skelly or grievance process, and letters indicating final imposition of discipline or other
documentation reflecting implementation of corrective action.
Unless a record or information is confidential or qualifies for delayed disclosure as provided by
Penal Code § 832.7(b)(8) or other law, the following records (hereinafter qualifying records) shall
be made available for public inspection no later than 45 days from the date of a request (Penal
Code § 832.7(b)(1)):
(a) Records relating to the report, investigation, or findings of:
1. The discharge of a firearm at another person by an officer.
2. The use of force against a person resulting in death or in great bodily injury (as
defined by Penal Code § 243(f)(4)) by an officer.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Personnel Records - 776
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Personnel Records
3. A sustained finding involving a complaint that alleges unreasonable or excessive
force.
4. A sustained finding that an officer failed to intervene against another officer using
force that is clearly unreasonable or excessive.
(b) Records relating to an incident where a sustained finding was made by the Department
or oversight agency regarding:
1. An officer engaged in sexual assault of a member of the public (as defined by
Penal Code § 832.7(b)).
2. Dishonesty of an officer relating to the reporting, investigation, or prosecution
of a crime, or directly relating to the reporting of, or investigation of misconduct
by, another officer, including but not limited to any false statements, filing false
reports, destruction, falsifying, or concealing of evidence, or perjury._
3. An officer engaged in conduct including but not limited to verbal statements,
writings, online posts, recordings, and gestures involving prejudice or
discrimination against a person on the basis of race, religious creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition,
genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender
expression, age, sexual orientation, or military and veteran status.
4. An officer made an unlawful arrest or conducted an unlawful search.
Qualifying records will be made available regardless of whether the officer resigns before the
Department or an oversight agency concludes its investigation (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(3)).
A record from a separate and prior investigation or assessment of a separate incident shall not
be released unless it is independently subject to disclosure (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(4)).
When an investigation involves multiple officers, the Department shall not release information
about allegations of misconduct or the analysis or disposition of an investigation of an officer unless
it relates to a sustained finding of a qualified allegation as provided by Penal Code § 832.7(b)(5).
However, factual information about the action of the officer during an incident or the statements
of an officer shall be released if the statements are relevant to a finding of the qualified allegation
against another officer that is subject to release (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(5)).
1013.13.1 NOTICE OF DELAY OF RECORDS
When there is justification for delay of disclosure of qualifying records, the Custodian of Records
shall provide written notice of the reason for any delay to a requester as follows (Penal Code §
832.7):
(a) Provide the specific basis for the determination that the interest in delaying disclosure
clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The notice shall also include the
estimated date for the disclosure of the withheld information.
(b) When delay is continued beyond the initial 60 days because of criminal enforcement
proceedings against anyone, at 180-day intervals provide the specific basis that
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Personnel Records - 777
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Personnel Records
disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with a criminal enforcement
proceeding and the estimated date for disclosure.
1. Information withheld shall be disclosed when the specific basis for withholding
the information is resolved, the investigation or proceeding is no longer active, or
no later than 18 months after the date of the incident, whichever occurs sooner,
unless:
(a) When the criminal proceeding is against someone other than an officer and
there are extraordinary circumstances to warrant a continued delay due
to the ongoing criminal investigation or proceeding, then the Department
must show by clear and convincing evidence that the interest in preventing
prejudice to the active and ongoing criminal investigation or proceeding
outweighs the public interest for prompt disclosure of records about
misconduct or use of force by officers.
In cases where an action to compel disclosure is brought pursuant to Government Code §
7923.000, the Department may justify delay by filing an application to seal the basis for withholding
if disclosure of the written basis itself would impact a privilege or compromise a pending
investigation (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(8)).
1013.13.2 DELAY OF RELEASE
Unless otherwise directed by the Chief of Police, the Custodian of Records should consult with a
supervisor familiar with the underlying investigation to determine whether to delay disclosure of
qualifying records due to any of the following conditions (Penal Code § 832.7):
(a) Active criminal investigations
1. Disclosure may be delayed 60 days from the date the misconduct or use of force
occurred or until the District Attorney determines whether to file criminal charges,
whichever occurs sooner.
2. After the initial 60 days, delay of disclosure may be continued if the
disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with a criminal enforcement
proceeding against an officer or against someone other than an officer who
engaged in misconduct or used the force.
(b) Filed criminal charges
1. When charges are filed related to an incident in which misconduct occurred or
force was used, disclosure may be delayed until a verdict on those charges is
returned at trial or, if a plea of guilty or no contest is entered, the time to withdraw
the plea has passed.
(c) Administrative investigations
1. Disclosure may be delayed until:
(a) There is a determination from the investigation whether the misconduct or
use of force violated law or department policy, but no longer than 180 days
after the date of the department’s discovery of the misconduct or use of
force or allegation of misconduct or use of force

1013.13.3 REDACTION
The Custodian of Records, in consultation with the Chief of Police or authorized designee, shall
redact the following portions of qualifying records made available for release (Penal Code §
832.7(b)(6)):
(a) Personal data or information (e.g., home address, telephone number, identities of
family members) other than the names and work-related information of officers
(b) Information that would compromise the anonymity of whistleblowers, complainants,
victims, and witnesses
(c) Confidential medical, financial, or other information where disclosure is prohibited by
federal law or would cause an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy that clearly
outweighs the strong public interest in records about possible misconduct and use of
force
(d) Where there is a specific, articulable, and particularized reason to believe that
disclosure of the record would pose a significant danger to the physical safety of the
officer or another person
Additionally, a record may be redacted, including redacting personal identifying information,
where, on the facts of the particular case, the public interest served by not disclosing the
information clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosing it (Penal Code § 832.7(b)(7)).

Meal Periods and Breaks
1016.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for meal periods and breaks during an

Sworn employees shall remain on duty and subject to call during meal breaks. All other employees

Lactation Break Policy
1017.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide reasonable accommodations to employees desiring to
express breast milk for the employee’s infant child (29 USC § 207 and Labor Code §§ 1030-1032).
1017.2 POLICY
It is the policy of this department to provide, in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act,
reasonable break time and appropriate facilities to accommodate any employee desiring to
express breast milk for her nursing infant child (29 USC § 207 and Labor Code § 1030).
1017.3 LACTATION BREAK TIME
A rest period should be permitted each time the employee has the need to express breast milk (29
USC § 207). In general, lactation breaks that cumulatively total 30 minutes or less during any four-
hour work period or major portion of a four-hour work period would be considered reasonable.
However, individual circumstances may require more or less time. Such breaks, if feasible, should
be taken at the same time as the employee’s regularly scheduled rest or meal periods.
While a reasonable effort will be made to provide additional time beyond authorized breaks, any
such time exceeding regularly scheduled and paid break time will be unpaid (Labor Code § 1030).
Employees desiring to take a lactation break shall notify the Communications Center or a
supervisor prior to taking such a break. Such breaks may be reasonably delayed if they would
seriously disrupt department operations (Labor Code § 1032).
Once a lactation break has been approved, the break should not be interrupted except for
emergency or exigent circumstances.
1017.4 PRIVATE LOCATION
The Department will make reasonable efforts to accommodate employees with the use of an
appropriate room or other location to express milk in private. Such room or place should be in
close proximity to the employee’s work area and shall be other than a bathroom or toilet stall. The
location must be shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public (29
USC § 207 and Labor Code § 1031).
Employees occupying such private areas shall either secure the door or otherwise make it clear
to others that the area is occupied with a need for privacy. All other employees should avoid
interrupting an employee during an authorized break, except to announce an emergency or other
urgent circumstance.
Authorized lactation breaks for employees assigned to the field may be taken at the nearest
appropriate private area.
1017.5 STORAGE OF EXPRESSED MILK
Any employee storing expressed milk in any authorized refrigerated area within the Department
shall clearly label it as such and shall remove it when the employee ends her shift.

Overtime Compensation Requests
1019.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
It is the policy of the Department to compensate non-exempt salaried employees who work
authorized overtime either by payment of wages as agreed and in effect through the Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU), or by the allowance of accrual of compensatory time off. In order to
qualify for either, the employee must complete and submit an Extraordinary Duty Report as soon
as practical after overtime is worked.
1019.1.1 DEPARTMENT POLICY
Because of the nature of police work, and the specific needs of the Department, a degree of
flexibility concerning overtime policies must be maintained.
Non-exempt employees are not authorized to volunteer work time to the Department. All requests
to work overtime shall be approved in advance by a supervisor. If circumstances do not permit
prior approval, then approval shall be sought as soon as practical during the overtime shift and in
no case later than the end of shift in which the overtime is worked.
Short periods of work at the end of the normal duty day (e.g., less than one hour in duration)
may be handled unofficially between the supervisor and the employee by flexing a subsequent
shift schedule to compensate for the time worked rather than by submitting requests for overtime
payments. If the supervisor authorizes or directs the employee to complete a form for such a
period, the employee shall comply.
The individual employee may request compensatory time (aka "comp time") in lieu of receiving
overtime payment.
1019.2 TYPES OF OVERTIME AND COMPENSATION
Time spent in a pay status but not actually worked (e.g., sick leave, vacation leave, comp time,
holiday leave, etc.) shall be considered "time worked" in computing the basic forty hour week.
However, employees shall be eligible to work in an overtime capacity while actually on such
absence, but only in accordance with the provisions of the current MOU between the City of
Berkeley and the employee's working group.

Outside Employment
1020.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
In order to avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest for departmental employees engaging in
outside employment, all employees shall obtain written approval from the Chief of Police prior to
engaging in any outside employment. Approval of outside employment shall be at the discretion
of the Chief of Police in accordance with the provisions of this policy.
1020.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Outside Employment - Any member of this department who receives wages, compensation or
other consideration of value from another employer, organization or individual not affiliated directly
with this department for services, product(s) or benefits rendered. For purposes of this section,
the definition of outside employment includes those employees who are self-employed and not
affiliated directly with this department for services, product(s) or benefits rendered.
1020.2 OBTAINING APPROVAL
No member of this department may engage in any outside employment without first obtaining
prior written approval from the City Manager. Failure to obtain prior written approval for outside
employment or engaging in outside employment is prohibited by this policy and may lead to
disciplinary action.
In order to obtain approval for outside employment, the employee must complete a Request to
Engage in Outside Employment Application which shall be submitted to the employee’s immediate
supervisor. The application will then be forwarded through channels to the Chief of Police and
the City Manager.
If approved, the employee will be provided with a copy of the approved permit. Unless otherwise
indicated in writing on the approved permit, a permit will be valid through the end of the calendar
year in which the permit is approved. Any employee seeking to renew a permit shall submit a new
Request to Engage in Outside Employment Application in a timely manner.
Any employee seeking approval of outside employment, whose request has been denied, shall
be provided with a written reason for the denial of the application at the time of the denial (Penal
Code § 70(e)(3)).
1020.2.1 APPEAL OF DENIAL OF OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
If an employee’s Request to Engage in Outside Employment Application is denied or withdrawn
by the Department, the employee may file a written notice of appeal to the City Manager.
If the employee’s appeal is denied, the employee may file a grievance pursuant to the procedure
set forth in the current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
1020.2.2 REVOCATION/SUSPENSION OF OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT PERMITS
Any outside employment permit may be revoked or suspended under the following circumstances:
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Outside Employment - 794
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Outside Employment
(a) Should an employee's performance at this department decline to a point where
it is evaluated by a supervisor as needing improvement to reach an overall level
of competency, the Chief of Police may, at his or her discretion, revoke any
previously approved outside employment permit(s). That revocation will stand until the
employee's performance has been reestablished at a satisfactory level and his/her
supervisor recommends reinstatement of the outside employment permit
(b) Suspension or revocation of a previously approved outside employment permit may
be included as a term or condition of sustained discipline
(c) If, at any time during the term of a valid outside employment permit, an employee’s
conduct or outside employment conflicts with the provisions of department policy, the
permit may be suspended or revoked
(d) When an employee is unable to perform at a full duty capacity due to an injury or
other condition, any previously approved outside employment permit may be subject
to similar restrictions as those applicable to the employee's full time duties until the
employee has returned to a full duty status
1020.3 PROHIBITED OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT
Consistent with the provisions of Government Code § 1126, the Department expressly reserves
the right to deny any Request to Engage in Outside Employment Application submitted by an
employee seeking to engage in any activity which:
(a) Involves the employee’s use of departmental time, facilities, equipment or supplies,
the use of the Department badge, uniform, prestige or influence for private gain or
advantage
(b) Involves the employee’s receipt or acceptance of any money or other consideration
from anyone other than this department for the performance of an act which the
employee, if not performing such act, would be required or expected to render in the
regular course or hours of employment or as a part of the employee’s duties as a
member of this department
(c) Involves the performance of an act in other than the employee’s capacity as a member
of this department that may later be subject directly or indirectly to the control,
inspection, review, audit or enforcement of any other employee of this department
(d) Involves time demands that would render performance of the employee’s duties for
this department less efficient
1020.3.1 OUTSIDE SECURITY AND PEACE OFFICER EMPLOYMENT
Consistent with the provisions of Penal Code § 70, and because it would further create a potential
conflict of interest, no member of this department may engage in any outside or secondary
employment as a private security guard, private investigator or other similar private security
position.
1020.3.2 SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS
Except for emergency situations or with prior authorization from the division captain, undercover
officers or officers assigned to covert operations shall not be eligible to work overtime or other

enforcement status.
1020.4 DEPARTMENT RESOURCES
Employees are prohibited from using any department equipment or resources in the course of or
for the benefit of any outside employment. This shall include the prohibition of access to official
records or databases of this department or other agencies through the use of the employee’s
position with this department.
1020.4.1 REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RECORDS
Employees approved for outside employment expressly agree that their personal financial records
may be requested and reviewed/audited for potential conflict of interest (Government Code §
3308; Government Code § 1126). Prior to providing written approval for an outside employment
position, the Department may request that an employee provide his/her personal financial records
for review/audit in order to determine whether a conflict of interest exists. Failure of the employee
to provide the requested personal financial records could result in denial of the off-duty work
permit. If, after approving a request for an outside employment position, the Department becomes
concerned that a conflict of interest exists based on a financial reason, the Department may
request that the employee provide his/her personal financial records for review/audit. If the
employee elects not to provide the requested records, his/her off-duty work permit may be revoked
pursuant to the Revocation/Suspension of Outside Employment Permits section of this policy.
1020.5 CHANGES IN OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT STATUS
If an employee terminates his or her outside employment during the period of a valid permit,
the employee shall promptly submit written notification of such termination to the Chief of Police
through channels. Any subsequent request for renewal or continued outside employment must
thereafter be processed and approved through normal procedures set forth in this policy.
Employees shall also promptly submit in writing to the Chief of Police any material changes in
outside employment including any change in the number of hours, type of duties or demands of
any approved outside employment. Employees who are uncertain whether a change in outside
employment is material are advised to report the change.
1020.6 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WHILE ON DISABILITY
Department members engaged in outside employment who are placed on disability leave or
modified/light-duty shall inform their immediate supervisor in writing within five days whether or
not they intend to continue to engage in such outside employment while on such leave or light-
duty status. The immediate supervisor shall review the duties of the outside employment along
with any related doctor’s orders, and make a recommendation to the Chief of Police whether such
outside employment should continue.
In the event the Chief of Police determines that the outside employment should be discontinued or
if the employee fails to promptly notify his/her supervisor of his/her intentions regarding their work

writing) may be made to the Chief of Police to restore the permit.

Temporary Modified-Duty Assignments
1027.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy establishes procedures for providing temporary modified-duty assignments. This policy
is not intended to affect the rights or benefits of employees under federal or state law, City
rules, current memorandums of understanding or collective bargaining agreements. For example,
nothing in this policy affects the obligation of the Department to engage in a good faith, interactive
process to consider reasonable accommodations for any employee with a temporary or permanent
disability that is protected under federal or state law.
1027.2 POLICY
Subject to operational considerations, the Berkeley Police Department may identify temporary
modified-duty assignments for employees who have an injury or medical condition resulting in
temporary work limitations or restrictions. A temporary assignment allows the employee to work,
while providing the Department with a productive employee during the temporary period.
1027.3 ASSIGNMENTS FOR TEMPORARILY DISABLED EMPLOYEES
Employees on Workers' Compensation Leave: The City may assign any employee on Workers'
Compensation leave who is medically released to return to modified duty when feasible, to such
work within the Police Department which is consistent with medical limitations as determined by
the attending physician and the employee's skills and abilities at no reduction in the employee's
regular rate of pay. Prior to changing the shift of a member who is medically released to return
to work on modified duty, the Department shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to
accommodate the member’s personal/family scheduling for the duration of the period on modified
duty. However, if the Department is not able to accommodate the member’s personal/family
scheduling for the period of the modified duty the Department is not precluded from changing the
member’s shift.
1027.4 NON-INDUSTRIAL INJURIES
The City may accommodate an employee disabled with a non-industrial disability by providing a
modified work assignment. The City will periodically review such modified assignments in order
to determine whether such assignments continue to meet the needs of the City.
The modified assignment may be in that employee's classification. To be eligible for such
a modified assignment, the employee must initially, and subsequently at the request of the
City, provide the Human Resources Department with a medical statement from his or her
attending physician that clearly states the medical limitations and abilities of the employee and
estimates when the employee will be able to return to a regular assignment. If modification of
that assignment within that employee's classification does not serve the best interests of the
City, other classifications may be considered, subject to the approval of the Director of Human
Resources. Compensation will be provided at the level of the classification in which the temporarily
disabled employee works during the disability. The employee must meet standards of satisfactory
performance for the duration of the work assignment.

Temporary Modified-Duty Assignments
1027.5 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Priority consideration for temporary modified-duty assignments will be given to employees with
work-related injuries or illnesses that are temporary in nature. Employees having disabilities
covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act (Government Code § 12940 et seq.) shall be treated equally, without regard to any
preference for a work-related injury.
No position in the Berkeley Police Department shall be created or maintained as a temporary
modified-duty assignment.
Temporary modified-duty assignments are a management prerogative and not an employee
right. The availability of temporary modified-duty assignments will be determined on a case-by-
case basis, consistent with the operational needs of the Department. Temporary modified-duty
assignments are subject to continuous reassessment, with consideration given to operational
needs and the employee’s ability to perform in a modified-duty assignment.
The Chief of Police or the authorized designee may restrict employees working in temporary
modified-duty assignments from wearing a uniform, displaying a badge, carrying a firearm,
operating an emergency vehicle, engaging in outside employment, or being otherwise limited in
employing their peace officer powers.
Temporary modified-duty assignments shall generally not exceed a cumulative total of 1,040 hours
in any one-year period.
1027.6 PROCEDURE
Employees may request a temporary modified-duty assignment for short-term injuries or illnesses.
Employees seeking a temporary modified-duty assignment should contact their supervisor, who
will make notifications via the chain of command.
The division captain will make a recommendation to the Chief of Police regarding temporary
modified-duty assignments that may be available based on the needs of the Department and the
limitations of the employee. The Chief of Police or the authorized designee shall confer with the
Personnel and Training Bureau or the City Attorney as appropriate.
Requests for a temporary modified-duty assignment of 20 hours or less per week may be approved
and facilitated by the division captain, with notice to the Chief of Police.
1027.7 ACCOUNTABILITY
Written notification of assignments, work schedules and any restrictions should be provided
to employees assigned to temporary modified-duty assignments and their supervisors. Those
assignments and schedules may be adjusted to accommodate department operations and the
employee’s medical appointments, as mutually agreed upon with the division captain.
1027.7.1 EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of employees assigned to temporary modified duty shall include, but not be
limited to:

functions of their jobs without restrictions or limitations.

duty status, in accordance with the Fitness for Duty Policy.
1027.9 PREGNANCY
If an employee is temporarily unable to perform regular duties due to a pregnancy, childbirth or a
related medical condition, the employee will be treated the same as any other temporarily disabled
employee (42 USC § 2000e(k)). A pregnant employee shall not be involuntarily transferred to a
temporary modified-duty assignment.
1027.9.1 NOTIFICATION
Pregnant employees should notify their immediate supervisors as soon as practicable and provide
a statement from their medical providers identifying any pregnancy-related job restrictions or
limitations. If at any point during the pregnancy it becomes necessary for the employee to take a
leave of absence, such leave shall be granted in accordance with the City’s personnel rules and
regulations regarding family and medical care leave.

travel and meeting time can be accomplished within one day.
(b) "Non-local" describes events where the distance or duration requires overnight travel,
or attendance is for more than one day regardless of the distance traveled.
1028.5 THE CITY OF BERKELEY'S ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION
Attendance shall conform to the City of Berkeley Administrative Regulation No. 3.9, "Attendance
and Payment of Expenses Associated with Conferences, Meetings, Seminars, Trainings, and
Workshops", which may be amended or superseded by further directives.

will, whenever possible be by air.
(b) All other methods of travel shall conform to those described in the COB Administrative
Regulation.
1028.6 OUTSIDE TRAINING REQUESTS
An employee desiring to attend a local event wherein there is an expenditure (i.e., meals, tuition
or registration), or any non-local event, shall at the earliest possible time, submit a written request
to the employee's commanding officer via an “Outside Training Request” form.
All training requests need to be approved first through the appropriate staffing Lieutenant. Those
assigned to attend training during their regular duty shift shall attend in an on-duty status.
Employees shall not flex or adjust their schedule in order to receive overtime or compensatory
time.
If approved, the division captain shall forward the request to the Personnel and Training Bureau,
indicating whether funds have been budgeted or are available.
Personnel and Training will prepare and submitthe "Attendance and Travel Request" form to
the Chief of Police for review. If approved, it will be forwarded to the Budget Officer in the City
Manager's Office for final review.
(a) Personnel and Training ensures appropriate notifications are made to the officer and

1028.7 TRAVEL TIME
Section 29 C.F.R. 785.39 of The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), provides that travel time is
compensable work time when it occurs during the employee’s regular working hours. Under this
regulation, compensable travel time includes travel time that occurs during the employee’s normal
working hours on nonworking days.
When attending an approved conference/training, “travel time to” will be compensable from the
time the employee leaves the PSB or their residence to the time they arrive at their destination
(i.e. hotel, class). On the return, “travel time from” will be compensable from the time the employee
leaves the conference/training to the time they arrive at the PSB or their residence.

Conference, Meeting and Training Attendance
When attending an approved conference or training, the time given for lunch is not compensable.
Participation in social gatherings or meetings that are not required for the completion of the
conference/training are not compensable.
For auditing purposes, when completing the “Training Time Credit Record”, the time spent
traveling needs to be documented separately from the “times attended”. Therefore this travel time
needs to be hand-written onto the Training Time Credit Record.
1028.8 MILEAGE
Mileage should be calculated by the distance from either the PSB or your residence to the event,
whichever is less (i.e. for a class in Sacramento, mileage from the employee’s house in Vacaville
would be used because it is closer to Sacramento than Berkeley). The number of miles will be
multiplied by the daily mileage rate (determined by the IRS, see COB Admin Regulation 7.2 - Use
of Private Vehicles). Mileage should be documented on the “Mileage Reimbursement” form.
1028.9 CLASS COMPLETION
Class time missed as a result of an excused or unexcused absence shall be made up with the

reimburse the employee, per COB Administrative Regulation 3.4 and POST requirements.

Employee Speech, Expression and Social
Networking
1029.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy is intended to address issues associated with employee use of social networking sites
and to provide guidelines for the regulation and balancing of employee speech and expression
with the needs of the Department.
Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit or infringe upon any communication, speech or
expression that is protected or privileged under law. This includes speech and expression
protected under state or federal constitutions as well as labor or other applicable laws. For
example, this policy does not limit an employee from speaking as a private citizen, including acting
as an authorized member of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, about matters
of public concern, such as misconduct or corruption.
Employees are encouraged to consult with their supervisor regarding any questions arising from
the application or potential application of this policy.
1029.1.1 APPLICABILITY
This policy applies to all forms of communication including, but not limited to, film, video, print
media, public or private speech, use of all Internet services, including the World Wide Web, e-
mail, file transfer, remote computer access, news services, social networking, social media, instant
messaging, blogs, forums, video and other file-sharing sites.
1029.2 POLICY
Public employees occupy a trusted position in the community, and thus, their statements have the
potential to contravene the policies and performance of this department. Due to the nature of the
work and influence associated with the law enforcement profession, it is necessary that employees
of this department be subject to certain reasonable limitations on their speech and expression. To
achieve its mission and efficiently provide service to the public, the Berkeley Police Department will
carefully balance the individual employee’s rights against the Department’s needs and interests
when exercising a reasonable degree of control over its employees’ speech and expression.
1029.3 SAFETY
Employees should consider carefully the implications of their speech or any other form of
expression when using the Internet. Speech and expression that may negatively affect the safety
of the Berkeley Police Department employees, such as posting personal information in a public
forum, can result in compromising an employee’s home address or family ties. Employees should
therefore not disseminate or post any information on any forum or medium that could reasonably
be anticipated to compromise the safety of any employee, an employee's family or associates.
Examples of the type of information that could reasonably be expected to compromise safety
include:

Employee Speech, Expression and Social Networking
• Disclosing a photograph and name or address of an officer who is working undercover.
• Disclosing the address of a fellow officer.
• Otherwise disclosing where another officer can be located off-duty.
1029.4 PROHIBITED SPEECH, EXPRESSION AND CONDUCT
To meet the department’s safety, performance and public-trust needs, the following are prohibited
unless the speech is otherwise protected (for example, an employee speaking as a private citizen,
including acting as an authorized member of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations,
on a matter of public concern):
(a) Speech or expression made pursuant to an official duty that tends to compromise or
damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Berkeley Police
Department or its employees.
(b) Speech or expression that, while not made pursuant to an official duty, is significantly
linked to, or related to, the Berkeley Police Department and tends to compromise or
damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Berkeley Police
Department or its employees. Examples may include:
1. Statements that indicate disregard for the law or the state or U.S. Constitution.
2. Expression that demonstrates support for criminal activity.
3. Participating in sexually explicit photographs or videos for compensation or
distribution.
(c) Speech or expression that could reasonably be foreseen as having a negative impact
on the credibility of the employee as a witness. For example, posting statements or
expressions to a website that glorify or endorse dishonesty, unlawful discrimination
or illegal behavior.
(d) Speech or expression of any form that could reasonably be foreseen as having a
negative impact on the safety of the employees of the Department. For example,
a statement on a blog that provides specific details as to how and when prisoner
transportations are made could reasonably be foreseen as potentially jeopardizing
employees by informing criminals of details that could facilitate an escape or attempted
escape.
(e) Speech or expression that is contrary to the canons of the Law Enforcement Code of
Ethics as adopted by the Berkeley Police Department.
(f) Use or disclosure, through whatever means, of any information, photograph, video or
other recording obtained or accessible as a result of employment with the Department
for financial or personal gain, or any disclosure of such materials without the express
authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.
(g) Posting, transmitting or disseminating any photographs, video or audio recordings,
likenesses or images of department logos, emblems, uniforms, badges, patches,
marked vehicles, equipment or other material that specifically identifies the Berkeley
Police Department on any personal or social networking or other website or web page,
without the express authorization of the Chief of Police.

(h) Accessing websites for non-authorized purposes, or use of any personal
communication device, game device or media device, whether personally or
department-owned, for personal purposes while on-duty, except in the following
circumstances:
1. When brief personal communication may be warranted by the circumstances
(e.g., inform family of extended hours).
2. During authorized breaks such usage should be limited as much as practicable
to areas out of sight and sound of the public and shall not be disruptive to the
work environment.
Employees should take reasonable and prompt action to remove any content, including content
posted by others, that is in violation of this policy from any web page or website maintained by
the employee (e.g., social or personal website).
1029.4.1 UNAUTHORIZED ENDORSEMENTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS
While employees are not restricted from engaging in the following activities as private citizens
or as authorized members of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, employees
may not represent the Berkeley Police Department or identify themselves in any way that could
be reasonably perceived as representing the Berkeley Police Department in order to do any of
the following, unless specifically authorized by the Chief of Police (Government Code § 3206;
Government Code § 3302):
(a) Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any political campaign or initiative.
(b) Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any social issue, cause or religion.
(c) Endorse, support or oppose any product, service, company or other commercial entity.
(d) Appear in any commercial, social or nonprofit publication or any motion picture, film,

Additionally, when it can reasonably be construed that an employee, acting in his/her individual
capacity or through an outside group or organization (e.g., bargaining group or officer
associations), is affiliated with this department, the employee shall give a specific disclaiming
statement that any such speech or expression is not representative of the Berkeley Police
Department.
Employees retain their right to vote as they choose, to support candidates of their choice and
to express their opinions as private citizens, including as authorized members of a recognized
bargaining unit or officer associations, on political subjects and candidates at all times while off-
duty.
However, employees may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect
the result of an election or a nomination for office. Employees are also prohibited from directly or
indirectly using their official authority to coerce, command or advise another employee to pay, lend
or contribute anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency or person for political
purposes (5 USC § 1502).

1029.5 PRIVACY EXPECTATION
Employees forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to e-mails, texts or anything published
or maintained through file-sharing software or any Internet site (e.g., Facebook, MySpace) that is
accessed, transmitted, received or reviewed on any department technology system.
The Department reserves the right to access, audit and disclose for whatever reason any
message, including attachments, and any information accessed, transmitted, received or reviewed
over any technology that is issued or maintained by the Department. This includes the department
e-mail system, computer network or any information placed into storage on any department system
or device.
It also includes records of all key strokes or web-browsing history made at any department
computer or over any department network.
The fact that access to a database, service or website requires a user name or password will
not create an expectation of privacy if it is accessed through a department computer or network.
However, the Department may not require an employee to disclose a personal user name or
password or open a personal social website, except when access is reasonably believed to be
relevant to the investigation of allegations of work related misconduct (Labor Code § 980).
1029.6 CONSIDERATIONS
In determining whether to grant authorization of any speech or conduct that is prohibited under
this policy, the factors that the Chief of Police or authorized designee should consider include:
(a) Whether the speech or conduct would negatively affect the efficiency of delivering
public services.
(b) Whether the speech or conduct would be contrary to the good order of the Department
or the efficiency or morale of its members.
(c) Whether the speech or conduct would reflect unfavorably upon the Department.
(d) Whether the speech or conduct would negatively affect the member’s appearance of
impartiality in the performance of his/her duties.
(e) Whether similar speech or conduct has been previously authorized.
(f) Whether the speech or conduct may be protected and outweighs any interest of the
Department.
1029.7 TRAINING
Subject to available resources, the Department should provide training regarding employee
speech and the use of social networking to all members of the Department.

Supervisors should make reasonable efforts to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions in a
timely manner, based on the severity of the hazard. These hazards should be corrected when
observed or discovered, when it is reasonable to do so. When a hazard exists that cannot be
immediately abated without endangering members or property, supervisors should protect or

condition.
Members who are necessary to correct the hazardous condition shall be provided with the
necessary personal protection equipment.

in any accident or hazardous substance exposure while on-duty shall report such event as soon
as practicable to a supervisor. Members observing or learning of a potentially hazardous condition
are to promptly report the condition to their immediate supervisors.

Line-of-Duty Deaths
1031.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to members of the Berkeley Police Department
in the event of the death of a member occurring in the line of duty and to direct the Department
in providing proper support for the member’s survivors.
The Chief of Police may also apply some or all of this policy in situations where members are
seriously injured in the line of duty.
1031.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:
Line-of-duty death - The death of a sworn member during the course of performing law
enforcement-related functions while on- or off-duty, or a non-sworn member during the course of
performing their assigned duties.
Survivors - Immediate family members of the deceased member, which can include spouse,
children, parents, other next of kin or significant others. The determination of who should be
considered a survivor for purposes of this policy should be made on a case-by-case basis given
the individual’s relationship with the member and whether the individual was previously designated
by the deceased member.
1031.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to make appropriate notifications and to provide
assistance and support to survivors and coworkers of a member who dies in the line of duty.
It is also the policy of this department to respect the requests of the survivors when they conflict
with these guidelines, as appropriate.
1031.3 ON-DUTY DEATH / SERIOUS INJURY PACKET
Each employee will receive a packet titled “On-Duty Death/Serious Injury.” The information
provided by the employee is completed voluntary and confidential. No one is under any obligation
to fill out the form.
Once the initial information packet is received, it will be stored in a secure location in the
Professional Standards Division. The packet will be available for updating at any time for the
employee, but should be made available for updating during the employee’s annual performance
appraisal by the employee’s supervisor. Once completed, the packet shall be returned to the
Professional Standards Division.
1031.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITY
After a line of duty death, members must allow sufficient time for proper notifications to be made to
the family and loved ones of the decedent. No member shall notify the decedent’s family members
or loved ones of the death unless directed to do so by the Watch Commander. No member
shall make notifications upon social media of the line-of-duty death. Members must allow time for

Law Enforcement Manual
Line-of-Duty Deaths
Command Staff to determine and respect the wishes of the decedent in regards to the notification
of his/her family members and loved ones.
1031.5 INITIAL ACTIONS BY COMMAND STAFF
(a) Upon learning of a line-of-duty death, the deceased member’s supervisor should
provide all reasonably available information to the Watch Commander and the
Communications Center.
1. Communication of information concerning the member and the incident should
be restricted to secure networks to avoid interception by the media or others
(see the Public Information Officer section of this policy).
(b) The Watch Commander should ensure that notifications are made in accordance with
the Officer-Involved Shootings and Deaths and Major Incident Notification policies as
applicable.
(c) If the member has been transported to the hospital, the Watch Commander or the
designee should respond to the hospital to assume temporary responsibilities as the
Hospital Liaison.
(d) The Chief of Police or the authorized designee should assign members to handle
survivor notifications and assign members to the roles of Hospital Liaison (to relieve
the temporary Hospital Liaison) and the Department Liaison as soon as practicable
(see the Notifying Survivors section and the Department Liaison and Hospital Liaison
subsections in this policy).
1031.6 NOTIFYING SURVIVORS
Survivors should be notified as soon as possible in order to avoid the survivors hearing about the
incident in other ways.
The Chief of Police or the authorized designee should review the deceased member’s emergency
contact information and make accommodations to respect the member’s wishes and instructions
specific to notifying survivors. However, notification should not be excessively delayed because
of attempts to assemble a notification team in accordance with the member’s wishes.
The Chief of Police, Watch Commander or the authorized designee should select at least two
members to conduct notification of survivors, one of which may be the Department Chaplain.
Notifying members should:
(a) Make notifications in a direct and compassionate manner, communicating as many
facts of the incident as possible, including the current location of the member.
Information that is not verified should not be provided until an investigation has been
completed.
(b) Determine the method of notifying surviving children by consulting with other survivors
and taking into account factors such as the child’s age, maturity and current location
(e.g., small children at home, children in school).
(c) Plan for concerns such as known health concerns of survivors or language barriers.

(d) Offer to transport survivors to the hospital, if appropriate. Survivors should be
transported in department vehicles. Notifying members shall inform the Hospital
Liaison over a secure network that the survivors are on their way to the hospital and
should remain at the hospital while the survivors are present.
(e) When survivors are not at their residences or known places of employment, actively
seek information and follow leads from neighbors, other law enforcement, postal
authorities and other sources of information in order to accomplish notification in as
timely a fashion as possible. Notifying members shall not disclose the reason for their
contact other than a family emergency.
(f) If making notification at a survivor’s workplace, ask a workplace supervisor for the
use of a quiet, private room to meet with the survivor. Members shall not inform the
workplace supervisor of the purpose of their visit other than to indicate that it is a family
emergency.
(g) Offer to call other survivors, friends or clergy to support the survivors and to avoid
leaving survivors alone after notification.
(h) Assist the survivors with meeting childcare or other immediate needs.
(i) Provide other assistance to survivors and take reasonable measures to accommodate
their needs, wishes and desires. Care should be taken not to make promises or
commitments to survivors that cannot be met.
(j) Inform the survivors of the name and phone number of the Survivor Support Liaison
(see the Survivor Support Liaison section of this policy), if known, and the Department
Liaison.
(k) Provide their contact information to the survivors before departing.
(l) Document the survivor’s names and contact information, as well as the time and
location of notification. This information should be forwarded to the Department
Liaison.
(m) Inform the Chief of Police or the authorized designee once survivor notifications have
been made so that other Berkeley Police Department members may be apprised that

The Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM)
and Peer Support Program
1032.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Berkeley Police Department places the greatest possible value and emphasis upon the
welfare of its members and recognizes public safety employees face situations which may
create significant distress. The Berkeley Police Department's Critical Incident Stress Management
(CISM) and Peer Support Program is designed to provide confidential emotional support during
and after times of personal or professional crisis to members who express a need for assistance,
or for whom supervisory staff feel could benefit from program involvement. The CISM and
Peer Support Program shall promote trust, allow anonymity, and preserve confidentiality for all
members utilizing the program.
1032.2 POLICY
It is the policy of the Berkeley Police Department to provide peer and psychological support for
members involved in critical incidents, on or off duty. This will be accomplished through the use
of the CISM and Peer Support Program.
1032.3 CRITICAL INCIDENT DEFINED
A critical incident is defined as any event that has a stressful impact which is sufficient enough
to overwhelm the usually effective coping skills of an individual. An event is considered a critical
incident based on an individual's unique, internal reaction to the event, not necessarily the external
appearance or apparent magnitude of the event. A critical incident is not necessarily a life-
threatening event. Common incidents that pose an increased potential for trauma include, but are
not limited to:
(a) Shootings
(b) An actual or perceived threat to one's life or of grievous physical harm
(c) Suicide or attempted suicide by a colleague
(d) Serious injury inflicted on, or death of, a colleague
(e) Serious injury or death of a non-member, especially a child
(f) Cruelty/abuse to a child
(g) Death or injury of a person resulting from duty operations
(h) Perceived "failure" during a tragic/traumatic event
(i) Large scale or prolonged disaster
(j) Events with high media exposure
(k) Any event that may have private or personal emotional significance to a member,
particularly when the event is characterized by: relative surprise; intense negative
emotion; and perceived helplessness.

The Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) and Peer Support Program
1032.4 CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT (CISM)
CISM is a crisis intervention program used to support employees involved in a critical incident. It
is a formal, highly structured, and professionally recognized process for helping those involved in
a critical incident to share their experiences, vent emotions, and learn about stress reactions and
symptoms. The CISM program is facilitated by the Peer Support Team.
CISM encompasses the following components:
(a) Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD): A structured group discussion of thoughts
and reactions resulting from the incident. Discussion of typical stress-related
symptoms will also be included. It is designed to mitigate acute symptoms, assess
the need for follow-up, and accelerate the normal recovery processes to provide, if
possible, a sense of post-crisis psychological closure.
(b) Defusing: A voluntary individual or group meeting held shortly after a critical incident
aimed to educate, inform and assess the needs of the employees exposed to the
incident. It is a brief process that, in most cases, is considered sufficient to assist the
employee in coping with the aftermath. The defusing may be used to determine the
need for a CISD and/or other services.
(c) Rest Information Transition Services (RITS) {formerly known as “Demobilization”}: The
CISM intervention used during a major catastrophe in which large numbers of persons
must be moved from a scene with the possibility of having to return to the scene
for addition work. (i.e. natural disaster; major transportation accidents) RITS occur
immediately after a member is removed from a scene and provides only the basic
needs necessary at that point, such as food, water, rest and informational handouts
regarding recuperation.
(d) Peer/Individual Debriefing: A discussion between the affected employee and a Peer
Support Team Member designed to help mitigate symptoms of stressful events and/
or to make referrals as needed.
(e) Peer Support: A process by which trained personnel provide emotional support and
referrals to a colleague during a crisis or when they are under stress. Generally, peer
support is sought by the employee in need or suggested by the employee's peer(s) or
supervisor. Peer Support does not replace the need for structured group intervention
following trauma.
All CISM components are intended to mitigate symptoms, assess the need for follow up and
accelerate the normal recovery process.
1032.5 PEER SUPPORT TEAM COMPOSITION
The Peer Support Team is a formally established and CISM trained group of peers and mental
health professionals capable of providing one-on-one support, referrals, assistance with stress
awareness and reduction, along with guidance during defusings and debriefings.
The Peer Support Team is comprised of the following members:

1032.11 CONFIDENTIALITY
The acceptance and success of the Peer Support Program will be determined largely in part
by the observance of confidentiality. It is imperative each Peer Support Team Member keep all
information learned about an employee confidential, within the guidelines of this program.
Team members are prohibited from sharing peer support conversation details with any other
members of the department. If a team member needs guidance regarding a particular topic, they
may contact the Coordinator. There may be times when a team member may need to share
specific information with the Coordinator in order to determine the proper level of support to give,
but this should only be done when absolutely necessary to care for the employee. The Coordinator
shall keep confidential any information received from team members.
The Coordinator may also need to share specific information with a team member when someone
may be more receptive to support if they are approached by a particular team member (other than
the Coordinator) with whom they are more familiar.
Employees shall not question Peer Support Team Members regarding their conversations with
other employees, nor will they be allowed to inquire as to which individuals attended a defusing
or CISD and/or what was said there.
Team members are prohibited from recording or taking notes while providing support to employees
or otherwise making a record, report, or notes after the fact.

“Confidential communication” means any information, including, but not limited to, written or oral
communication, transmitted between a BPD employee and a peer support team member that was
given in confidence. (GC 8669.3(a))
“Confidential communication” does not include a communication in which a BPD employee
discloses the commission of a crime or a communication in which the BPD employee’s intent to
defraud or deceive an investigation into a critical incident is revealed.
A BPD employee, whether or not a party to an action, has a right to refuse to disclose, and to
prevent another from disclosing, a confidential communication between themselves and a Peer
Support Team Member, when it was made while the Peer Support Team Member was providing
peer support services.
However, confidential communication may be disclosed under the following circumstances (GC
8669.4):
(a) To refer a law enforcement personnel to receive crisis referral services by a peer
support team member.
(b) During a consultation between two peer support team members.
(c) If the peer support team member reasonably believes that disclosure is necessary to
prevent death, substantial bodily harm, or commission of a crime.
(d) If the law enforcement personnel expressly agrees in writing that the confidential
communication may be disclosed.
(e) In a criminal proceeding
(f) If otherwise required by law.
1032.13 PEER SUPPORT TEAM REFERRALS
Department employees who believe another employee may benefit from Peer Support may make
a verbal or written referral to the Coordinator or Team Leader. The referred employee will be
contacted to assess their receptiveness to Peer Support and/or referrals. The identity of the person
who initiated the referral will remain confidential.
Individual employees may contact any Peer Support Team Member for an informal, confidential,
one-on-one discussion, anytime, at their discretion.
1032.14 PEER SUPPORT GUIDANCE
There may be times wherein an employee seeks advice or counsel from another employee who
is not on the Peer Support Team. The sought after employee may contact a Peer Support Team
Member for guidance but should maintain the original employee’s confidentiality. All employees
should know that when you seek advice from another employee who is not bound by policy to
confidentiality, there is no recourse to a breech in that confidentiality.

EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
1041.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Order is to establish policy and procedures for an informal performance review
and intervention program, the “Early Warning System” (EWS). The program monitors employee
performance that may be inconsistent with professional police conduct and cooperatively engages
employees to resolve areas of concern. The goal of EWS is early identification of employee
performance issues and correction of these issues through constructive counseling sessions
rather than the formal disciplinary process.
1041.2 POLICY
All employees shall participate in the EWS program and comply with the guidelines set forth in
this Order.
Participation in the EWS program shall not be deemed punitive, nor a formal disciplinary process.
(a) Notwithstanding the initiation of the EWS process, the Department retains its right
and responsibilities with regard to investigation of policy violation and enforcement of
employee discipline.
1041.3 PROCEDURES
Employee behavior or performance that is subject to EWS review includes, but is not limited to:
(a) Poor attendance and/or abusive use of leave;
(b) Multiple formal sustained or not sustained complaints;
(c) Multiple informal complaint inquiries:
(d) Multiple use of force incidents;
(e) Multiple obstructing/resisting arrest incidents;
(f) Multiple vehicle collisions; and,
(g) Substandard conduct/performance concerns observed by a superior officer.
(h) Irregular demographic stop data on pedestrian, bike, and vehicle enforcement, while
considering the factors of the assignment (geographical area of the city the officer is
working, the specific detail/assignment, and the nature of enforcement).
The Racial and Identify Protection Act (RIPA) data will be available to supervisors in the form
of an electronic data dashboard. This will provide supervisors and commanders with the ability
to review stop data created by officers assigned under their span of control. The individualstop
data for individual officers should be considered a personnel record as it may provide supervisory
guidance for specific officer stop data, if necessary. The public release of any RIPA data will remain
anonymized as previously agreed upon Meet and Confer with the Berkeley Police Association
and provisions of Government Code 3300 et.al.
Supervisors, commanders and managers shall monitor the activity of their subordinate employees
to identify actual or perceived unprofessional behavior and/or substandard performance that is

Accordingly, they are confidential personnel files and not public records.
Documents, data and records shall be maintained by the Office of the Chief of Police for a period
of two (2) years.
Access to EWS records shall be restricted to the supervisor, commander and/or manager involved
in the monitoring of a particular employee, subject to the approval of the Chief of Police.
(a) An individual employee may be granted access to EWS records that pertain to him/her.
1041.5 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW BOARD
The Chief of Police will convene a quarterly Review Board comprised of all Division Commanders
to review program records to determine if initiation of the EWS Program is recommended.
Upon consideration of the Review Board’s recommendation, the Chief of Police may direct an
employee to participate in the EWS program.

Extra Duty Employment
1043.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy covers extra duty employment, which consists of officers working
special details wherein the City of Berkeley has a contractual agreement to
provide services for a fee to private third parties.
1043.1.1 DEFINITIONS
Extra Duty Employment- Extra Duty Employment occurs when a member
of this Department performs police services at the request of a private third
party and receives overtime compensation or wages paid directly into their
routine pay, the cost of which the City will recover pursuant to a Service
Agreement between the private third party and the City. Approval shall be
obtained from the Chief of Police prior to any overtime being posted for Extra
Duty Employment.
1043.2 OBTAINING APPROVAL FOR EXTRA DUTY EMPLOYMENT
All requests for Extra Duty Employment will be offered only after a third party
has signed a Service Agreement and completed an Application for Extra Duty
Services prior to the officers being assigned.
The City is under no obligation to provide or approve Extra Duty Employment
and all requests must consider the following criteria:
• The overall staffing needs of the Department, including
Investigations and specialized patrols such as the Bike Force Team
• The impact of the request on officer wellness and fatigue mitigation
• The degree to which the extra duty employment supports overall
public safety and builds connections with the community.
• The potential the extra duty employment has to cast discredit upon
or create embarrassment for the Department or City Government.
In instances where the Department chooses not to staff an Extra Duty
Employment opportunity, the private third party will not incur any charges.
The completion of a Service Agreement and Application for Extra Duty
Services is required for all events in which the Berkeley Police Department
will seek reimbursement. All police grant work is excluded from this
policy. Mutual Aid response from the Berkeley Police Department may

include incidents wherein reimbursement is expected, however it is explicitly
excluded from the provisions of the Extra Duty Employment, and is covered
under General Order M-02, and Policy 327 (upon its publication).
Any private third party seeking Extra Duty Employment shall complete the
following:
• The private third party must complete the Service Agreement in
order to request Extra Duty Employment. This form is available on
the Police Department's website, and is attached to this policy.
• The Service Agreement may be entered into for a one-time
event, for repeating events, or to cover continuous service. Service
Agreements for Extra Duty Employment will span no longer
than the duration of one calendar year, automatically resetting
st
every January 1 for events that seek continuous services. In
circumstances like the Berkeley Unified School District which may
have different events spanning the year, the Service Agreement
for Extra Duty Employment should identify what activities or events
(i.e. sporting events, dances, graduation) are anticipated.Extra Duty
Employment outside of these events will require an additional
application. This allows for adjusted staffing consistent with the
needs of each respective event.
• City Manager approval must be obtained for all Service
Agreements.
• The private third party must complete an Application for
Extra Duty Employment. This form is available on the Police
Department's website, and is attached to this policy.
• The private third party must submit the Application for Extra
Duty Employment and any additional supporting documents to the
Special Events Sergeant.
• Chief of Police approval must be obtained for all Applications for
Extra Duty Employment
• The Special Events Sergeant will be the contact person between
the Department and the private third party on the status of their
respective application.
• The Special Events Sergeant will be responsible for posting the
overtime.

Special Order 2018-0001
1100.1 PC 647(E) ENFORCEMENT AND 9TH CIRCUIT DECISION
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently held in Martin v. City of Boise that municipalities may
not enforce general laws prohibiting sleeping on public property when there is nowhere else for
a homeless individual to sleep. The Court noted that its decision did not address enforcement
of ordinances "prohibiting sitting, lying, or sleeping outside at particular times or in particular
locations."
Effective immediately and until further notice, officers shall not enforce PC § 647(e) (lodging on
public property without the owner's consent) unless authorized to do so by the Chief of Police, such
as when participating in a coordinated effort with City of Berkeley staff engaged in an encampment
resolution activity.
This decision applies only to the enforcement of PC § 647(e). Officers shall enforce other
provisions of Penal Code and Berkeley Municipal Codes using existing policy and discretion,
including, but not limited to:
Laws relating to trespass on private property:
o 06.32.020 Park curfew violation 2200 - 0600 hrs;
o 06.32.030 No structures (including tents), large objects, or collection of objects
covering over 10 square feet may be placed in city parks without a permit;
o 13.36.065 City building rules - remaining on curtilage without COB business; and
o 14.32.040 Standing in roadway, use of divisional islands; i.e., on the median
Comm Center personnel should dispatch officers to assess complaints called in by the public, and
officers should evaluate calls on a case-by-case basis when attempting to address a complaint.
Should a given incident have no other enforcement option (e.g. there is only a PC § 647(e)
complaint) the officer should advise the reporting party of this issue.
This order is meant to clarify enforcement restrictions in light of the recent Ninth Circuit Court
decision, and will be in effect until it is rescinded or issued in the form of a policy.

1101.1 PC 835; CHANGES IN PENAL CODE
On January 1, 2020, CA Penal Code 835a, which governs use of force by police officers, became
law. Per Departmental Training Order 2019-00277, all sworn personnel were required to view
POST’s Training video, “AB 392: California’s New Use of Force Standards: What You Need to
Know”, which can be found at https://lp.post.ca.gov/activity/3023. POST also created a publicly
available resource page which includes this video and other resources, at https://post.ca.gov/use-
of-force-standards.
BPD’s current Use of Force Policy, General Order U-2, is being revised not only to incorporate
provisions of PC 835a, but also as a result of a Council referral. The revised policy will be issued
as Policy 300 in 2020.
Effective immediately, and until such time as the revised Use of Force policy is issued, General
Order U-2 remains in effect, and sworn personnel shall further ensure their actions are in
accordance with the new requirements of PC 835a, including but not limited to the provisions
below:
PC 835a(b) amends the “reasonable force” standard to “objectively reasonable force.”
PC 835a(c)(1) amends deadly force standards to include “totality of the circumstances” when:
• Defending against imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to an officer or to
another person.
• Apprehending a fleeing person for a felony
o Involving threatened or actual death or serious bodily injury;
o Where immediate apprehension is reasonably believed to be needed in order to
prevent death or serious bodily injury to another; and
o Which requires, when reasonable, that officers identify themselves and warn of
intent to use force.
PC 835a(c)(2) prohibits using deadly force against persons who pose a danger only to themselves.
PC 835a(d) amends self-defense language to include “objectively reasonable” force.
PC 835a(e) adds definitions for deadly force, imminent, and totality of the circumstances.
This order is meant to highlight legal requirements pertaining to use of force by sworn personnel
in light of the recent changes to CA Penal Code 835a, and will be in effect until it is rescinded or
issued in the form of a revised use of force policy.

1102.1 BMC CHAPTER 2.99--BAN ON FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY
The purpose of this Special Order is to (1) ensure all members are aware of the Berkeley Municipal
Code’s prohibition on the use of Facial Recognition Technology, including but not limited to use of
the Clearview application, or any software service or application providing facial recognition search
capabilities, and; (2) to provide a procedure to report the inadvertent or unintentional receipt of
information obtained through Facial Recognition Technology to the Chief of Police.
On March 27, 2018, the Berkeley City Council enacted Berkeley Municipal Code (BMC) Chapter
2.99, Acquisition and Use of Surveillance Technologies. This ordinance governs the use and
acquisition of certain described surveillance technologies by the Berkeley Police. The ordinance
included “facial recognition software” among those surveillance technologies governed by the
ordinance.
On October 15, 2019, the Berkeley City Council amended BMC Chapter 2.99, in order to formally
ban the Department’s use of any “Facial Recognition Technology”, defined as “an automated
or semi-automated process that assists in identifying or verifying an individual based on an
individual’s face.”
It is a violation of BMC 2.99 and this policy for any employee to “obtain, retain, request, access,
or use any facial recognition technology.”
There are two exceptions to the ban, as provided BMC 2.99.030(5):
1. Facial recognition technology may be used to unlock personal communication devices,
such as an cellular phone, iPad, or similar device, which is used in the regular course
of conducting City business, whether city-owned or personally owned; and
2. The inadvertent or unintentional receipt, access to, or use of information obtained
from Face Recognition Technology, provided that the BPD employee did not request
or solicit the receipt, access to, or use of such information, and all copies of
the information are promptly destroyed upon discovery of the information, and the
information is not used for any purpose.
(a) However, in the case of inadvertent receipt of information received relating to
the investigation of a specific crime that may have been generated from Face
Recognition Technology, but which was not intentionally solicited, shall not be a
violation of this ordinance, and may be used in connection with a specific criminal
investigation.
Should any employee inadvertently or unintentionally receive information obtained from Face
Recognition Technology, that employee shall report the receipt of the information through their
chain of command to the Chief of Police, who shall ensure such receipt is reported in the Annual
Surveillance Technology Report, as required by the ordinance (2.99.030(5)).
Use of Clearview or any other facial recognition application or software service providing facial
recognition search capabilities is not allowed under the ordinance and this policy.

1103.1 BMC CHAPTER 2.99--PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR TEMPORARY
ACQUISITION AND USE OF NEW SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT; EXIGENT
CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPTION
The purpose of this Special Order is to (1) ensure BPD personnel are aware of department-
owned surveillance technologies and policies; and (2) to provide a procedure to request the
temporary acquisition and use of surveillance technology not already owned by the Berkeley Police
Department, under the exigent circumstances exception to BMC 2.99, Acquisition and Use of
Surveillance Technology.
On March 27, 2018, the Berkeley City Council enacted Berkeley Municipal Code (BMC) Chapter
2.99, Acquisition and Use of Surveillance Technologies. This ordinance governs the use and
acquisition of certain surveillance technologies by the Berkeley Police Department.
The Department currently owns and utilizes the following three Surveillance Technologies: Body
Worn Cameras, Automated License Plate Readers, and Global Positioning System Tracking
Devices. Use of these technologies is governed by existing policies.
BMC Chapter 2.99.030(1) prohibits BPD from seeking, acquiring, sharing or using any new
Surveillance Technology without obtaining authorization from the City Council, except in exigent
circumstances, and as approved by the City Manager.
Surveillance Technology is defined in Section 2.99.020(1) as follows:
“Surveillance Technology” means an electronic device, system utilizing an electronic device,
or similar technological tool used, designed, or primarily intended to collect audio, electronic,
visual, location, thermal, olfactory, biometric, or similar information specifically associated with,
or capable of being associate with, any individual or group. Examples of covered Surveillance
Technology include, but are not limited to: cell site simulators (Stingrays); automatic license plate
readers, body worn cameras, gunshot detectors (ShotSpotter); facial recognition software; thermal
imaging systems, except as allowed under Section 1(d); social media analytics software; gait
analysis software; and video cameras that record audio or video and can remotely transmit or can
be remotely accessed.
Exigent Circumstance is defined in Section 2.99.020(5) as follows:
… a good faith belief that an emergency involving imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury
to any person, or imminent danger or significant property damage, requires the use of Surveillance
Technology or the information it provides.
The Exigent Circumstance exception for using new Surveillance Technology without prior City
Council approval is set forth in Section 2.99.040 as follows:
… the City Manager may borrow, acquire, and/or temporarily use Surveillance Technology in
Exigent Circumstances. In such cases, the City Manager must: (1) Provide written notice of
that acquisition or use to the City Council within 30 days following the commencement of such

exigency; (2) if the use of the technology is anticipated to continue beyond the exigency, the
Department must submit an Acquisition Report and Use Policy to Council; and (3) include the
surveillance technology in the next City Manager’s Annual Surveillance Technology Report.
Effective immediately, any Department member wishing to use any new Surveillance Technology
(not already in use at BPD) due to an Exigent Circumstance must, in writing, formally request
permission to use the technology. This request shall describe the exigency, the new technology to
be used, and how the new technology is anticipated to be successful. This request shall be made
through the employee’s chain of command, to the Chief of Police, who will convey the request
to the City Manager for consideration and approval. If approved, the Chief will provide written
authorization for the use of the new technology.
Should use be approved, the use shall be reported publicly to the Council within 30 days of the
commencement of the exigency, and again in the following year’s Annual Surveillance Technology
Report.
This order is meant to highlight legal requirements pertaining to use of Surveillance Technology
by Berkeley Police personnel in light of the recent changes to Berkeley Municipal Code. 2.99, and
will be in effect until it is rescinded or issued in the form of a self-standing policy.

1106.1 RESPONSE TO AB 1950
AB-1950 (Kamlager) - Probation: Length of Terms
Penal Code 1203a and 1203.1 (Amend)
PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
This Special Order is intended to provide temporary guidance and clarity to the recently
implemented AB 1950, which limits the term of probation to no longer than two years for a
felony conviction, and one year for misdemeanor conviction, except for offenses that include a
specific probation term in statute. Additionally this order provides an outline of the workflow for the
alignment process with the stakeholders, the main highlights of AB 1950, the list of exceptions, and
method for officers and dispatchers to apply AB 1950 to individuals with active Alameda County
Probation terms..
BACKGROUND:
AB 1950 was signed into law on Sept. 30, 2020. This new law amended PC 1203a and 1203.1,
reducing probation terms for felony and misdemeanors. It is now being understood to apply
retroactively to people already on probation, thus shortening their probation terms. At the Alameda
County Chiefs of Police and Sheriff Association recent meeting the Alameda County District
Attorney announced their interpretation of AB 1950. The Alameda County DA has chosen to apply
the AB 1950 probation limits to pre-2021 probations. The DA’s office will be compiling a list of
eligible probation and dockets, ultimately terminating the applicable probations on the record.
These will effectively be updated in CRIMS.
AB 1950 provides that the two-year probation limit does not apply to offenses defined by law
as violent felonies, or to an offense that includes a specific probation term within its provisions.
It provides that for these offenses, the court, in the order granting probation, may suspend the
imposing or the execution of the sentence and may direct that the suspension may continue for
a period of time not exceeding the maximum possible term of the sentence and under conditions
as it shall determine
It should also be noted thatthere may be exceptions to this list in the future plea agreements
post-2021, for example:
It's possible that post 1/1/21 a person commits a robbery (PC 211). The suspect agrees to a plea
of PC 487 and may waive their right to AB 1950 and accept a 5 year probation. This would be
reflected in CRIMS in the probation and dockets for cases resolved in 2021and beyond.
PROCEDURES:
While the Alameda County District Attorney is addressing the modification to applicable active

1107.1 FAIR AND IMPARTIAL POLICING
rd
On February 23 , 2021 the Berkeley City Council directed the Berkeley Police Department
to make several policy and procedural changes to reflect their recommendations. This policy
provides context and guidance for complying with those recommendations.
1107.2 TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT MODEL
One of the FIP recommendations was to "focus the basis for traffic stops on safety and not just low-
level offenses." In order to address this recommendation, a working group consisting of various
members of the Police Department with varying levels of experience was formed. The Chief
reviewed the recommendations of this working group as well as collision statistics and directed that
the Berkeley Police Department adopt a three-pronged approach to traffic enforcement. Officers
are provided access to Berkeley data and statistics including primary collision factors, and are
directed to focus on those safety violations wherever they are observed.
Prong #1 - Primary Collision Factors- (Berkeley Specific data)
Vehicle code violations resulting in severe and fatal collisions in Berkeley. Examples:
• Unsafe speed
• Pedestrian right-of-way at crosswalks
• Failure to yield for turns
• Red light violations
• Stop sign violations
Prong #2 - Community Reports
Responding to calls from community members. Examples:
• Possible DUI driver (i.e. car reportedly swerving)
• Driver that's fallen asleep at a red light
• A variety of unsafe driving incidents occurring, including sideshows
• Crime involving vehicle
o Hit and Run
o Crime with get-away vehicle description
Prong #3 - Community Caretaking-
Violations that are safety concerns not necessarily Primary Collision Factors. Examples:
• Seatbelt violations
• Distracted driving (hands free law)

Special Order 2023-0001
• Expired registration/more than 6 months
• DUI
• Moving violations
1107.3 REAFFIRMATION OF CONSENT SEARCHES
In collaboration with the Police Accountability Board, the Berkeley Police Department has adopted
a new consent search form that officers are expected to use when seeking consent search. See
Policy 311 for further details.
1107.4 LIMIT WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF INDIVIDUALS ON SUPERVISED RELEASE
The City Council made a final change to limit the acceptable instances that officers may exercise
search conditions on respective parole and probationers. Per Policy 311, subsection 6:
In accordance with California law, individuals on probation, parole, Post Release Community
Supervision, or other supervised release status may be subject to warrantless search as a
condition of their probation. Officers shall only conduct probation or parole searches to further a
legitimate law enforcement purpose or rehabilitative purpose. Searches shall not be conducted in
an arbitrary, capricious, or harassing fashion.
Individuals contacted or detained who are found to be on searchable Supervised Release for
1
Violent Offenses may be searched pursuant to the terms of their Supervised Release conditions.
The decision to detain a person and conduct a probation or parole search, or otherwise enforce
2
probation or parole conditions for those on supervised release for nonviolent crimes , should be
made, at a minimum, in connection with articulable facts that create a reasonable suspicion that
a person may have committed a crime, be committing a crime, or be about to commit a crime
or which demonstrate that the individual is connected in some way to criminal activity or that the
individual is an imminent threat to officer or citizen safety. In the conduct of all such detentions and
searches, officers shall consciously avoid the application of bias, shall not use such detentions or
searches as a means to harass or annoy, and shall not conduct such detentions and searches in
a manner that targets or is discriminatory toward any protected class.
1. Offenses involving the use of force, the threat of force, the use or possession of
a weapon, sexual violations against the person of another, human trafficking, and
the use of force or threats to public safety. Battery on a Peace Officer (Penal Code
§ 243(b)), Reckless Evasion in a Vehicle (Vehicle Code § 2800.2(a)), or a violent
felony as defined in Penal Code § 667.5(c).), fall into the categories of violent crimes,
weapons offenses, sex crimes and/or crimes involving threats to public safety in
accordance with state law.
2. "Non-Violent Offenses" are defined as offenses in which violence or use of a weapon
or threat to life safety is not a factor.
1107.5 PROFILING BY PROXY
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to fair and impartial policing, including recognizing
the act of profiling by proxy and the detrimental impact it has on our community. The Berkeley

Law Enforcement Manual
Special Order 2023-0001
Police Department encourages leadership at every level of the organization - from call takers
(dispatchers) to officers to supervisors – to act within their individual span of influence and control
to combat profiling by proxy. To that end, the steps to identify, intercept, and document profiling
by proxy shall be included in the Communications Center Operations Manual and Policy 401, Fair
and Impartial Policing.
1107.6 REGULAR ANALYSIS OF STOP DATA
The police department released the requested historical data in December of 2020.BPD stop,
arrest, and calls for service data are regularly updated in the Open Data Portal and will be updated
in near real time on the Transparency Hub.
1107.7 UPDATED BUSINESS CARDS
BPD Officers shall offer business cards to all detained individuals. All future business cards
ordered will have a QR code which directs to a link for commendations, concerns, and information
on police-civilian encounters.

Social Host Ordinance
1200.1 BACKGROUND
In 2007, the Berkeley City Council enacted the Social Host Ordinance (SHO).By enacting
the Ordinance, Council formally recognized the harm caused by the unsupervised and illegal
consumption of alcohol by minors at unlicensed premises, public places and private property,
including private residences.
The Council stated that parties, gatherings and/or events where minors are consuming alcohol
can lead to physical altercations, drunk driving, binge drinking, unprotected or unplanned sex,
sexual assaults, vandalism and excessive neighborhood noise. The control of parties, gatherings
and/or events where minors are consuming alcohol is necessary when such activity is determined
to be a threat to the peace, health, safety or general welfare of the public (BMC §13.49.030).
1200.2 PURPOSE
The purpose of the SHO is to address the problems identified above and protect the public health,
safety and general welfare by enhancing the enforcement of laws prohibiting the consumption
of alcohol by minors and reducing the costs of providing police services to parties, gatherings,
or events requiring a response, by requiring hosts to ensure minors are not consuming alcoholic
beverages (BMC 13.49.010B).
1200.3 DEFINITIONS
Minor: Any person under 21 years of age.
Gathering: A group of persons who have assembled or are assembling for a social occasion or
social activity.
Host: The person or person(s) who permit, allow, or host a gathering under his/her/their control
where minors will be present (e.g., resident tenant, owner, event organizer, house president, etc.).
Premises: Any residence or other private property, individual unit or place, including any
commercial or business property.
Public Place: Any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access and
includes, but is not limited to, streets, highways, and the common areas of schools, hospitals,
apartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities and shops.
1200.4 THE STATUTE
BMC §13.49.030(A) provides it is unlawful for any person to:
(a) Permit, allow, or host a party, gathering or event at his or her place of residence or
other private property, public place, or any other premises under his or her control
where alcoholic beverages are being consumed by any minor.
The SHO does not apply:
1. If all minors consuming an alcoholic beverage are being supervised by their parents
or guardians [BMC §13.49.030(B)]; or,
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Social Host Ordinance - 886
Published with permission by Berkeley Police DepartmentBerkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Social Host Ordinance
2. At any location or place regulated by the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control (i.e., bars, restaurants, special events with an issued 1-day ABC license.)
[BMC §13.49.030(C)];
1200.5 CRIMINAL CHARGING AND PENALTIES
A violation of the SHO may be cited as either a misdemeanor or an infraction. However, a violation
shall not be charged as a misdemeanor unless the citing officer observes egregious behavior or
aggravating circumstances (BMC §13.49.040A). The fine for the first violation is $250 and will
increase for subsequent violations by the same person (BMC §13.49.040B).
1200.6 HOST SELF-REPORTING - NO CRIMINAL LIABILITY
A person hosting the gathering shall not be in violation if he/she seeks assistance from the
Police Department or other law enforcement agency to remove any person who refuses to abide
by the host’s responsibilities imposed by this Ordinance, or end the event because he/she has
been unable to prevent minors from consuming alcoholic beverages, despite having taken all
reasonable steps to do so, as long as such a request for assistance is made before any other
person makes a complaint (BMC §13.49.030E).
1200.7 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOST
The SHO requires the Host take reasonable steps to prevent the consumption of alcoholic
beverages by any minor at the gathering.
To be held responsible for a SHO violation, the Host must have knowledge of the prohibited
activity. The Host shall be deemed to have actual or constructive knowledge that a minor has
consumed an alcoholic beverage under either of the following conditions:
(a) If the Host is present at the premises of the gathering at the time any minor consumes
an alcoholic beverage; or,
(b) If the Host has not taken all reasonable steps to prevent the consumption of alcoholic
beverages by minors, as set forth in BMC §13.49.030(D):
1. Controlling access to alcoholic beverages at the gathering.
2. Controlling the quantity of alcoholic beverages at the gathering.
3. Verifying the age of persons attending the gathering by inspecting driver’s
licenses or other government issued identification.
4. Monitoring the activities of persons at the gathering.
5. Monitoring the conduct of minors at the gathering.
1200.8 PROCEDURES
To successfully enforce the SHO, the prohibited activity and the standards of ‘reasonableness’
and ‘knowledge’, as related to any criminal liability on the part of the Host(s), should be identified
and evaluated. Therefore, investigating officers should:
(a) Make observations and conduct interviews that clarify the factual circumstances of a
gathering or event wherein minors may be consuming alcoholic beverages.
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Social Host Ordinance - 887

Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Social Host Ordinance
(b) Request the assistance of additional officers, if available, to ensure officer safety and
accomplish desired detentions.
(c) Interview detainees to verify their identity and age, and explore how they gained
access to the event and came into possession of an alcoholic beverage.
(d) Note the presence or absence of anyone collecting money at the door or checking
identification cards, etc.
(e) Document all relevant observations (i.e., dozens of minors running around with red
cups attempting to elude officers, several high school age or other minors detained
with alcohol on their person or breath, etc.)
If any of the detainee(s) are determined to be under 21 years of age, determine if the Host took
reasonable steps (as outlined above in 1200.7(b)) to control their access to alcoholic beverages.
If the Host is determined not to have taken reasonable steps, he/she should be issued a citation
for a violation of BMC §13.49.030, or if necessary, taken into custody for a misdemeanor violation.
1200.9 DOCUMENTATION
An investigation of a Social Host Ordinance (SHO) violation shall be documented on a case report.
Enforcement of the SHO does not preclude enforcement of other observed criminal violations.
A SHO violation may also constitute a violation of the “Second Response” Ordinance (BMC
§13.48.040), see the Second Response Policy for further.

Taxicab Enforcement
1201.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Professional Standards Bureau has prepared this enforcement guide to provide assistance
in identifying, and enforcing the Berkeley Municipal Code (BMC), and California Vehicle Code
(CVC) as they apply to taxicabs being operated in the City of Berkeley. It is intended to serve as a
general summary of ordinances that pertain to taxicab enforcement, but is not an exhaustive list
of enforcement options (use of non-taxicab related CVC statutes, or Penal Code statutes). The
codes are abbreviated for ease of reading, and to focus on codes that are reasonably enforceable
by BPD officers. There are other administrative codes that govern taxicabs, but it would not be
feasible for BPD officers to enforce these codes.
1201.2 GENERAL GUIDELINES
There are three classes of taxicabs operating within the City of Berkeley: permitted taxicabs, non-
permitted taxicabs, and illegal taxicabs.
Permitted taxicabs have been inspected for safety, have paid fees to the City, and are operated
by permitted drivers. They are required to follow City of Berkeley taxicab regulations.
Non-permitted taxicabs are those with permits issued by other cities. Some City of Berkeley
requirements also apply to them, such as, for instance the requirement that they not obstruct the
right of way.
Illegal taxicabs are those not allowed to operate at all, whether or not they do so in compliance
with Ordinance.
Permitted taxicabs may use taxi stands and pick up customers in the City, but are not allowed
to create their own taxi stands by waiting near exits to crowded venues such as University of
California football games, concerts, etc. Non-permitted taxicabs are prohibited from taking on any
customers within the City, or attempting to do so.
When enforcing violations of the Ordinance by non-permitted taxicabs, specifically whether they
have picked up a customer in Berkeley, the investigating officer should question both the taxicab
driver, and the passengers independently to ascertain where the customer was picked up.
The following are examples of a driver's permit and vehicle permit:
A permitted taxicab is required to have these two items in the vehicle (see below for further
detail), and to have a business owner permit on file with the City. A BPD officer is not expected to
investigate whether a taxicab operator has a business owner permit, but can refer this matter to
the Code Enforcement Unit (see contact information at the conclusion of this policy), if the officer
suspects the taxicab operator is not in compliance with this ordinance.

Second Response
1202.1 BACKGROUND
In 1993, the Berkeley City Council stated,
“Due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people, such as parties, frequently
become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to the peace, health, safety, or
general welfare of the public as a result of conduct such as one or more of the following: excessive
noise, excessive traffic, obstruction of public streets or crowds who have spilled over into public
streets, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace,
and litter.
The City of Berkeley is required to make multiple responses to such unruly gatherings in order to
restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety. Such gatherings are a burden on scarce
City resources and can result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed
and police protection to the rest of the City being reduced. In order to discourage the occurrence
of repeated loud and unruly gatherings, the persons responsible for the public nuisance created
by these gatherings should be fined.”
1202.2 THE ORDINANCE
Berkeley Municipal Code §13.48.020 states it shall be unlawful and a public nuisance to conduct
a gathering, which incorporates the following criteria:
• Ten or more persons are involved;
• The event is occurring on private property; and,
• The gathering is occurring in a manner which constitutes a substantial disturbance
of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a significant segment of a
neighborhood, as a result of unlawful conduct.
Examples of such unlawful conduct may include the following:excessive noise or traffic,
obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, public intoxication, the service of alcohol to
minors, public urination, fights, disturbances of the peace and littering.A gathering constituting a
public nuisance may be abated by all reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order
requiring the gathering be disbanded, and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under any
applicable local laws and state statutes.
The Ordinance explicitly prohibits targeted enforcement against student housing.However,
nothing in the Ordinance precludes the City from setting priorities in the use of its resources by
employing the Ordinance against events that are the most disruptive, against properties at which
disruptive events are held most often, or on the basis of other similar legitimate factors.
1202.3 EXHIBIT A
When the police intervene at a gathering which constitutes a nuisance under the Ordinance, a
“Notice” must be prominently posted at the premises at which the nuisance occurred.The Notice,
referred to in the Ordinance as an “Exhibit A,” states that the intervention by the police has been

Law Enforcement Manual
Second Response
necessitated as a result of a public nuisance caused by an event at the premises.The “Exhibit
A” also indicates:
• The date and time of the police intervention;
• Any subsequent police intervention at the same premises within a one hundred twenty-
day (120) period, including an intervention on the same day as the posting of the
“Exhibit A,” shall result in civil penalties;and,
• Liability may fall upon any guests causing the public nuisance, all sponsors of the
gathering, all residents of the premises, all persons in control of the premises, and all
owners of the premises that reside on or adjacent to the premises or are present at
the premises when the notice is posted.
The residents or persons in control of the property, if present, must be consulted regarding a
location where the Notice can be conspicuously and securely posted.When consulted, those
persons, as well as sponsors of the nuisance event, if involved in the decision, become responsible
for ensuring that the “Exhibit A” is neither removed nor defaced.If either occurs, those responsible
for the security of the notice become liable for a civil penalty of $100.00, in addition to any other
penalties which may be due under the Ordinance.
1202.4 EXHIBIT B
Should the police intervene at a premises with an active “Exhibit A”, a new notice shall be posted
and a fine imposed against the property by means of an administrative citation.The new notice,
referred to in the Ordinance as an “Exhibit B,” states that the intervention by the police has been
necessitated as a result of a public nuisance caused by an event at the premises.The “Exhibit
B” also indicates:
• The date and time of the police intervention;
• Whether the nuisance is the second, third, fourth, etc. at the premises within the last
120 days;
• The fine amount associated with the violation (second - $750, third - $1,500, fourth
and subsequent violations - $2,500);
• The 120 day period is extended another 120 days from the date of the “Exhibit B”
posting;
• Liability may fall upon any guests causing the public nuisance, all sponsors of the
gathering, all residents of the premises, all persons in control of the premises, and all
owners of the premises that reside on or adjacent to the premises or are present at
the premises when the nuisance occurs.
For every subsequent violation of the Ordinance, a new “Exhibit B” form shall be completed and
posted. The residents or persons in control of the property, if present, must be consulted regarding
a location where the Notice can be conspicuously and securely posted.When consulted, those
persons, as well as sponsors of the nuisance event, if involved in the decision, become responsible
for ensuring that the “Exhibit B” is neither removed nor defaced.If either occurs, those responsible

for the security of the notice become liable for a civil penalty of $100.00, in addition to any other
penalties which may be due under the Ordinance.

(f) Submit the report in AEGIS, route the original Exhibit form to Records Management
and place a copy in the CSB mailbox to ensure proper administrative follow-up.
1202.6 REPEAT VIOLATIONS
Officers should be aware of what properties in their assigned area have been posted for Ordinance
violation(s) and should monitor them for repeat violations within the prescribed term.If, within
120 days of the initial posting, an officer investigates another unruly gathering as described in
the Ordinance, the officer should replace the Exhibit A posting with an Exhibit B, document
their observations and actions on a new Case Report and forward a copy of the report CSB for
administrative follow-up.
It is important to know that with each subsequent occurrence of a nuisance at a previously posted
property, the 120 day “clock” resets.For example, if an address was initially posted on January
1st, and there was a reported violation on March 1st, the 120 day period restarts and would

Second Response
th
conclude, absent a subsequent violation, on June 28 .As such, knowing the date of the most
recent documented Ordinance violation at a posted property will allow an officer to determine if
the 120 day term is still in effect or has expired.
1202.7 CSB AREA COORDINATOR FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES
(a) An Area coordinator receiving a follow up request for a Second Response violation
should: Ensure a Premise Alert has been entered into CAD for the subject property:
Minimally, the CAD entry should include: the date/time the Exhibit form was posted; the
name and phone number of the liable person(s) contacted; and, the location where the
notice form was posted.Additionally, if regarding an Exhibit B, the alert should include
the violation number (second, third, fourth, etc.) and the fine amount to be imposed
against the property.Having this information available in CAD will help patrol officers
enforce the Ordinance should they respond to subsequent loud, unruly parties during
the 120 day period.Additionally, requesting the Communication Center staff to revise
the CAD event description to “2nd Response” will help with event tracking and future
administrative research efforts.
(b) Mail a notice of the police intervention to the property owner(s):BMC 13.48.030(B)
requires a notice of police intervention be mailed to the property owner(s) on file in the
City’s property tax assessment records.The notice is a letter from the responsible Area
Coordinator along with a copy of the Exhibitform, which advisesthe property owner(s)
that any subsequent event within 120 days on the same premises necessitating police
intervention shall result in liability of the property owner for all penalties associated
with such intervention as more particularly set forth in the Ordinance.
(c) Set a three week follow-up inspection: The Area Coordinator should set a three week
follow-up in order to conduct an initial inspection visit of the site to examine the Exhibit
A posting.In the event the form has been removed, a new Exhibit A form shall be
posted.Observed violations of the Ordinance and related enforcement actions must be
documented in a supplemental report, which will support a demand for the prescribed
civil fine.
(d) Conduct additional inspectionsto ensure Ordinance compliance and document any
subsequent violations on a Case Report.
(e) Mail an Exhibit B notice letter for each subsequent violation: For each instance wherein
an Ordinance violation is identified, the Area Coordinator is responsible for mailing an
Exhibit B notice letter to the person(s) liable for the civil penalty.
(f) Provide the City of Berkeley Finance Department with copies of all reports and letters
associated with any Ordinance violation to facilitate billing of the responsible parties.
1202.8 CIVIL PENALTIES AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES
Civil penalties may be assessed against all persons liable for the City's intervention to abate a
gathering deemed a public nuisance.The schedule of penalties is as follows:
• For a second violation of the Ordinance during the 120-day period, the penalty shall
be the sum of $750.

Second Response
• For a third violation of the Ordinance response during the 120-day period, the penalty
shall be the sum of $1,500.
• For any subsequent violation of the Ordinance during the 120-day period, the penalty
shall be the sum of $2,500 for each intervention by police.
Billed by the Exhibit B form, all persons liable for applicable civil penalties will be directed to remit
payment within thirty days of the letter’s postmark to the City of Berkeley Finance Department,
who will be responsible for collections.If payment is not received within the stated term, the bill will
be deemed delinquent, and all persons liable for the penalties will be subject to accrued interest
at the maximum legal rate, as well as an additional penalty of $100.
1202.9 SUMMARY
A tool wielded to quell public nuisances, the “2nd Response” Ordinance can improve, if not restore,
the quality of life in neighborhoods adversely affected by loud and unruly gatherings.This result
cannot occur, however, unless the Ordinance is used effectively.Knowing the elements of the
statute and the role the police officer plays in its enforcement will help ensure success.Make and
document detailed observations in your report, post the Exhibit A form appropriately, and route
the report package properly so the administrative effort that follows may be readily accomplished.

Smoking Ordinance
1203.1 BACKGROUND
Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and
that breathing secondhand smoke can cause lung cancerin nonsmokers.Those who are at special
risk include elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Other health
hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory
infection, decreased respiratory function, broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm.
1203.2 PURPOSE

understanding of enforcement recommendations.
1203.3 SMOKING POLLUTION CONTROL ORDINANCE
1203.3.1 LEGISLATIVE INTENT
The intent of the City Council in enacting this Ordinance was to:
(a) Protect public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places, places of
employment, and specially designated public play areas where small children are at
risk of choking on or ingesting cigarette butts and other toxic tobacco litter;
(b) Guarantee the rights of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that
the right to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke; and,
(c) Promote self-enforcement through educational outreach regarding smoking
prohibitions.
1203.3.2 DEFINITIONS

Appendix A offers maps specifying commercially zoned areas.
1203.3.4 PLACES NOT REGULATED BY ORDINANCE
The Ordinance does not regulate smoking in retail tobacco stores or private residences, unless
the residence is used as a child or health care facility.Notwithstanding this exemption, the owner
or person in control of the business may designate the entire establishment as nonsmoking.
1203.3.5 SMOKING MEDICAL CANNABIS AT DISPENSARIES
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, the inhalation of medical cannabis
through the use of an electronic smoking device inside a dispensary and on the public right of
way within 50 feet of such a Dispensary, by a member of that dispensary, is not prohibited by this
Chapter. (Ord. 7369-NS § 3, 2014)
1203.3.6 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
Set forth in BMC §12.70.110, any person who violates the provisions of this Ordinance shall be
guilty of an infraction and subject to fine.The following subsections describe particular unlawful
activity:
(A) It shall be unlawful for any person who owns, manages, operates or otherwise controls the use
of any premises subject to the restrictions of this Ordinance to fail to comply with its provisions.
(B) It shall be unlawful for any person to smoke in any area where smoking is prohibited by the
provisions of this Ordinance.
1203.4 ENFORCEMENT
The Ordinance states, “any owner, manager, operator or employee of any establishment
controlled by this [Ordinance] shall have the right to inform persons violating this [Ordinance] of
the appropriate provisions thereof.”Similarly, private citizens may “bring legal action” to enforce
this Ordinance.Officers should be responsive to public requests for law enforcement assistance.
Keeping with the Council’s intent, gaining compliance through education and responsible party
cooperation is the preferred method of enforcement.In most cases, advice and a warning should
prove sufficient to resolve the complaint.Enforcement of this Ordinance is not intended to consume
an inordinate amount of an officer’s time and should not be considered a high priority.
In some instances, however, the issuance of a citation may be necessary.For example, citing a
chronic violator who has disregarded repeated warnings may be appropriate in order to abate a
violation and convey the desired public health message.Similarly, a community member reporting
an Ordinance violation may be insistent that a citation be issued.In such cases where the reported
offense is observed by the investigating officer, a citation may be written.

Enforcement of Isolation and Quarantine Orders
1204.1 ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE
The City of Berkeley Public Health Officer has the authority to issue civil orders for the isolation
of persons diagnosed with or under investigation for having an infectious disease, and for the
quarantine of persons who have been exposed to an infectious disease. This Training and
Information Order establishes Berkeley Police Department policy for the enforcement of such
isolation and quarantine orders.
Isolation is defined as "separation of infected persons from other persons for the period of
communicability in such places and under such conditions as will prevent the transmission of
the infectious agent." (17 CCR § 2515.) The Public Health Officer may require strict or modified
isolation of an infected person. (17 CCR §§ 2516-17.)
Quarantine is defined as "the limitation of freedom of movement of persons or animals that
have been exposed to a communicable disease for a period of time equal to the longest usual
incubation period of the disease, in such manner as to prevent effective contact with those not
so exposed." (17 CCR § 2520.) If a disease requires quarantine of persons having contacts in
addition to isolation of the infected person, "the local health officer shall determine the contacts
who are subject to quarantine, specify the place to which they shall be quarantined, and issue
instructions accordingly."
Isolation and quarantine may be enforced pursuant to the order of the Public Health Officer without
a prior court order based on the Health Officer's determination that there is reasonable cause that
a person is infected with or has been exposed to a communicable disease. (Health and Safety
Code § 120130(d); In re Application of Arata (1921) 52 Cal. App. 380, 383.) The Health Officer's
order must inform the isolated or quarantined person of the right to seek administrative review
of the order by the Public Health Division and the right to seek judicial review pursuant to Penal
Code § 1473.
Any person who violates an isolation or quarantine order is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $1,000, or by imprisonment for a term of not more
than 90 days, or by both. (Health and Safety Code § 120295.) Each day of the violation may be
charged a separate offense. (Ibid.)
The Chief of Police may enforce any isolation or quarantine order issued by the Public Health
Officer. (Gov. Code § 41601.) If any person refuses to comply with the Health Officer's order, a
Police Officer or an authorized employee (as defined in Policy 300) may arrest and/or detain the
person to enforce the order. Any arrest of a person for a violation of an isolation or quarantine order
shall be made in accordance with the Use of Force Policy (Policy 300). The isolated or quarantined
person shall be detained at home, in a medical facility, or at some other location consistent with
the requirements of the isolation or quarantine order, as directed by the Public Health Officer. It
may be necessary for a Police Officer or an authorized employee to remain present to ensure
compliance with the terms of the isolation or quarantine order.

Enforcement of Isolation and Quarantine Orders
All Berkeley Police Department members assisting with the enforcement of an isolation or
quarantine order shall comply with infection control procedures to control the risk of transmission
of aerosol transmissible diseases. (8 CCR § 5199(c).)
Tuberculosis Isolation and Quarantine: It should be noted that special procedures apply for the
isolation or quarantine of persons infected with or exposed to tuberculosis. Those procedures
are outside the scope of this policy . Berkeley Police Department members shall direct inquiries
regarding enforcement of an isolation or quarantine order arising from infection with or exposure to
tuberculosis through their chain of command to the Chief of Police or his/her designee, who shall
in turn consult with the Public Health Officer and the City Attorney's Office prior to issuing direction.

Surveillance Use Policy - Body Worn Cameras
1300.1 PURPOSE
This Surveillance Use Policy is issued in compliance and fulfills the requirements of Berkeley
Municipal Code (BMC) Chapter 2.99, and incorporates by reference language from the Berkeley
Police Department Body Worn Camera Policy #425- Body Worn Cameras and adds elements as
required by BMC Chapter 2.99. Guidelines, procedures, and practices for the use of Body Worn
Cameras by members of the Berkeley Police Department while in performance of their duties are
fully set forth in the Berkeley Police Department Law Enforcement Manual Policy 425- Body Worn
Cameras.
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes that video recording of contacts between department
personnel and the public provides an objective record of these events, and that the use of a
recording system complements field personnel in the performance of their duties by providing
a video record of enforcement and investigative field contacts, which can enhance criminal
prosecutions, limit civil liability, increase transparency, and enhance professionalism in the
delivery of police services to the community. A video recording of an event or contact also enables
the delivery of timely, relevant, and appropriate training to maximize safety for both community
members and BPD personnel. (Ref. policy 425.2)
1300.2 AUTHORIZED USE
This policy is not intended to describe every possible situation in which the BWC should be used.
Members shall activate the BWC as required by this policy in (a)-(f) below, and may activate the
BWC at any time the member believes it would be appropriate or valuable to record an incident
within the limits of privacy described herein.
The BWC shall be activated in any of the following situations:
(a) All in-person enforcement and investigative contacts including pedestrian stops and
field interview (FI) situations.
(b) Traffic stops including, but not limited to, traffic violations, stranded motorist assistance
and all crime interdiction stops.
(c) Self-initiated field contacts in which a member would normally notify the
Communications Center.
(d) Any search activity, including the service of search or arrest warrants; probation,
parole, or consent searches where the member is seeking evidence of an offense,
or conducting a safety sweep or community caretaking sweep of the premises. Once
a location has been secured and the member is not interacting with detainees or
arrestees, the member may mute their BWC when conducting a search for evidence.
(e) Any other contact that the member determines has become adversarial after the initial
contact in a situation where the member would not otherwise activate BWC recording.

(f) Transporting any detained or arrested person and where a member facilitates entry
into or out of a vehicle, or any time the member expects to have physical contact with
that person.
At no time is a member expected to jeopardize his or her safety in order to activate a BWC.
The BWC should be activated by members in anticipation of situations described above, and in
any unanticipated, rapidly unfolding situation where activation becomes required, as soon as the
member can do so safely.
Members should activate their BWC when conducting custodial interviews unless there are other
recording devices being used. Members shall document and explain in their report the reason for
not recording custodial interviews, should a BWC be de-activated while conducting a custodial
interview or interrogation. (Ref. policy 425.7)
1300.2.1 PROHIBITED USE
Members are prohibited from using a department-issued BWC for personal use and are prohibited
from making personal copies of recordings.
Members are prohibited from retaining BWC recordings. Members shall not duplicate or distribute
such recordings, except for department business purposes. All such recordings shall be retained
at the Department.
Recordings shall not be used by any member for the purpose of embarrassment, intimidation or
ridicule. (Ref. policy 425.13)
1300.3 DATA COLLECTION
BWC use is limited to enforcement and investigative activities involving members of the public.
The BWC recordings will capture video and audio evidence for use in criminal investigations,
administrative reviews, training, civil litigation, and other proceedings protected by confidentiality
laws and department policy. Improper use or release of BWC recordings may compromise ongoing
criminal and administrative investigations or violate the privacy rights of those recorded and is
prohibited. (Ref. policy 425.3)
1300.4 DATA ACCESS
Members are authorized to review their own BWC video files at any time in furtherance of official
business. Such official business includes, but is not limited to, preparing written reports, prior to
or while providing testimony in a case or being deposed. Members may review recordings as
an evidentiary resource, except as stated in subsection 1300.4.1 below. Pursuant to 1300.2.1,
members shall not retain personal copies of recordings. Members shall not use the fact that a
recording was made as a reason to write a less detailed report. (Ref. policy 425.17)
1300.4.1 OFFICER INVOLVED INCIDENTS RESULTING IN GRAVE BODILY INJURY OR
DEATH
(a) In the event of a critical incident that results in grave bodily injury or death, including an
officer-involved shooting or an in-custody death, the BWC of the involved member(s)
shall be taken from them and secured by a supervisor, commander, or appropriate

investigator, as necessary. The involved member(s) shall not access or obtain their
footage of the incident until such time as the criminal investigator(s) have reviewed
the video files. It will be the responsibility of the investigation team’s supervisor to
coordinate with the involved member’s supervisor to obtain footage of the incident on
behalf of the member.
(b) Personnel uploading secured BWC video files shall not view the files unless
authorized.
(c) No member involved in a critical incident may view any video recordings prior to
an interview by the appropriate criminal investigative unit, and receiving command
approval.
(d) Prior to the conclusion of the criminal interview process, the involved member and/
or the member’s representative will have an opportunity to review the member’s
recording(s). The involved member may choose to provide additional information to
supplement his or her statement by providing a supplemental statement or separate
supplemental document. In no case shall a member alter a report made prior
to reviewing the recording. Where both an original statement and supplemental
statement or document have been produced, both the original statement, without
alteration, and the supplemental statement or document shall be included in the report.
(e) The Department acknowledges that recordings taken during critical incidents obtained
from BWCs do not necessarily reflect the full extent of the nature of the event or the
experience, analysis, training, threat assessment or state of mind of the individual
officers(s) in a given incident. Moreover, the recordings, especially video, have
limitations and may depict events differently than the events recalled by the involved
officer. Specifically, it is understood that the recording device will capture information
that may not have been heard and/or observed by the involved officer and that officers
may see and hear events that are not captured by the camera.
Officers who are involved in any critical incident where video recordings exist depicting
the involved officer, either as a subject officer or witness, shall be provided the following
admonishment to the initial interview or submission of the initial written report:
"In this case, there is video evidence that you will have an opportunity to view. Video evidence
has limitations and may depict the events differently than you recall, and may not depict all of the
events as seen or heard by you. Video has a limited field of view and may not capture events
normally seen by the human eye. The "frame rate” of video may limit the camera's ability to capture
movements normally seen by the human eye. Lighting as seen on the video may be different
than what is seen by the human eye. Videos are a two-dimensional medium and may not capture
depth, distance or positional orientation as well as the human eye. Remember, the video evidence
is intended to assist your memory and ensure that your statement explains your state of mind at
the time of the incident." (Ref. policy 425.17.1)
1300.4.2 SUPERVISORY REVIEW
With the exception of section 1300.4.1 above, supervisors are authorized to review relevant
recordings any time they are reviewing and approving case reports from their subordinates. (Ref.
policy 425.17.2)

1300.4.3 INVESTIGATORY REVIEW
Supervisors are authorized to review relevant recordings any time they are investigating alleged
misconduct or reports of meritorious conduct, or whenever such recordings support review of the
member’s performance. (Ref. policy 425.17.3)
(a) Recorded files may also be reviewed:
1. Upon approval by a supervisor, by any member of the Department who
is participating in conduct of an official investigation, such as a personnel
complaint, an administrative investigation or a criminal investigation.
2. Pursuant to lawful process or by court or District Attorney personnel who are
otherwise authorized to review evidence in a related case.
3. By personnel assigned to investigatory units who are authorized to view any
BWC video file associated to their active investigations, unless otherwise
prohibited by policy.
4. Upon approval by the Chief of Police, Internal Affairs investigators may review
BWC video with a complainant.
5. Pursuant to 1300.9, access to recordings will be granted to the Police Review
Commission Officer and/or Investigator investigating a specific compliant where
BWC evidence files are available, and are not part of any ongoing criminal
investigation of an officer.
(b) Investigators conducting criminal or internal investigations shall:
1. Advise the coordinator to restrict access to the BWC file in criminal or internal
investigations, as necessary.
2. Review the file to determine whether the BWC file is of evidentiary value and
process it in accordance with established protocols.
3. Notify the coordinator to remove the access restriction when the criminal/internal
investigation is closed.
1300.4.4 TEACHING OR LEARNING TOOL
BWC files may also be reviewed by training staff regarding specific incidents where such files may
serve as an internal learning or teaching tool. In the event that videos are intended to be used for
training purposes, the involved officer(s) will first be consulted. If he/she objects to the use of the
video, such objection shall be submitted to the person in charge of training who shall weigh the
value of the video for training against the officer(s) objections and basis for the objection. Should
the person in charge of training refuse to grant the request of the involved officer(s), the matter
shall be heard by the Chief of Police, or his/her designee, prior to utilizing the video. (Ref. policy
425.17.4). Any member(s) of the public that appears in video footage used for outside training
purposes (e.g. if video footage is shown by an authorized member of the Police Department for
training purposes outside of the Berkeley Police Department such as at a conference or other
training), to the extent feasible, will be blurred out or redacted in a manner to protect the privacy
rights of those involved in the incident.

1300.4.5 COB CIVIL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS
BWC recordings may be reviewed and used by City of Berkeley counsel for civil claims and
lawsuits. (Ref. policy 425.17.5)
1300.5 DATA PROTECTION
To assist with identifying and preserving data and recordings, members shall tag and download
recordings in accordance with procedure, and document the existence of the recording in the
related case report. Transfers must occur at the end of the member’s shift, and any time the
member is aware that the storage capacity of the BWC is nearing its limit. In circumstances when
the officer cannot complete this task, the officer’s supervisor shall immediately take custody of the
BWC and be responsible for uploading the data. Officers shall tag each file with the appropriate
case/incident number, provide a descriptive title, and select an appropriate category for each
recording, using the Axon View app or via the Evidence.com site.
Members are prohibited from intentionally erasing, altering, reusing, modifying or tampering with
original audio video recordings.(Ref. policy 425.14)
1300.6 CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS PROTECTION
The Berkeley Police Department’s mission is to safeguard our diverse community through
proactive law enforcement and problem solving, treating all people with dignity and respect. The
Berkeley Police Department recognizes the need to protect its ownership and control over shared
information and to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the public, in accordance with federal and
state law and City of Berkeley rules and regulations. The procedures described within this policy
(Data Access, Data Protection, Data Retention, Public Access and Third Party Data Sharing)
protect against the unauthorized use of BWC data. These policies will ensure the data is not used
in a way that would violate or infringe upon anyone’s civil rights and/or liberties, including but not
limited to potentially disparate or adverse impacts on any communities or groups.
1300.7 DATA RETENTION
The Department shall retain all recordings for a minimum of 60 days. Incidents involving
consensual contacts, and aid to citizens will be retained for six months, and cold reports will be
retained for one year. Recordings of incidents involving use of force by a police officer, detentions,
arrests, or recordings relevant to a formal or informal complaint shall be retained for a minimum
of two years and one month. Recordings relating to court cases and personnel complaints that
are being adjudicated will be manually deleted at the same time other evidence associated with
the case is purged in line with the Department’s evidence retention policy. Any recordings related
to administrative or civil proceedings shall be maintained until such matter is fully adjudicated,
at which time it shall be deleted in line with the Department’s evidence retention policy, and any
applicable orders from the court.
Recordings created by equipment testing or accidental activation may be deleted after 60 days.

1300.8 PUBLIC ACCESS AND THIRD PARTY DATA SHARING
All recordings should be reviewed by the Custodian of Records and the City Attorney’s Office prior
to public release, see General Order R-23 (Release of Public Records and Information). (Ref.
policy 425.18) and Government Code § 6254(f).

Surveillance Use Policy-Fixed Automated
License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
1305.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the capture, storage and use of digital data
obtained through the use of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology. Department
Personnel shall adhere to the requirements of the Surveillance Use-Fixed ALPRs in this policy as
well as the corresponding Use Policy -422.
The policy of the Berkeley Police Department is to utilize ALPR technology to capture and store
digital license plate data and images while recognizing the established privacy rights of the public.
All data and images gathered by the ALPR are for the official use of this department. Because
such data may contain confidential information, it is not open to public review.
The Berkeley Police Department does not permit the sharing of ALPR data gathered by the City
or its contractors/subcontractors for federal immigration enforcement, pursuant to the California
Values Act (Government Code § 7282.5; Government Code § 7284.2 et seq) – these federal
immigration agencies include Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and
Border Patrol (CBP).
1305.2 DEFINITIONS
(a) Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR): A device that uses cameras and computer
technology to compare digital images to lists of known information of interest.
(b) ALPR Operator: Trained Department members who may utilize ALPR system/
equipment. ALPR operators may be assigned to any position within the Department,
and the ALPR Administrator may order the deployment of the ALPR systems for use
in various efforts.
(c) ALPR Administrator: The Investigations Bureau Captain or the Chief's designee,
serves as the ALPR Administrator for the Department.
(d) Hot List: A list of license plates associated with vehicles of interest compiled from one
or more databases including, but not limited to, NCIC, CA DMV, Local BOLO's, etc.
(e) Vehicles of Interest: Including, but not limited to vehicles which are reported as
stolen, display stolen license plates or tags; vehicles linked to missing and/or wanted
persons and vehicles flagged by the Department of Motor Vehicle Administration or
law enforcement agencies.
(f) Detection: Data obtained by an ALPR of an image (such as a license plate) within
public view that was read by the device, including potential images (such as the plate
and description of vehicle on which it was displayed), and information regarding the
location of the ALPR system at the time of the ALPR's read.
(g) Hit Alert from the ALPR system that a scanned license plate number may be in the
National Crime Information Center (NCIC) or other law enforcement database for a

specific reason including, but not limited to, being related to a stolen car, wanted
person, missing person, domestic violation protective order or terrorist-related activity.
1305.3 AUTHORIZED AND PROHIBITED USES
An ALPR shall only be used for official law enforcement business.
Use of an ALPR is restricted to the purposes outlined below. Department members shall not use,
or allow others to use the equipment or database records for any unauthorized purpose (Civil
Code § 1798.90.51; Civil Code § 1798.90.53).
(a) An ALPR shall only be used for official law enforcement business.
(b) An ALPR may be used in conjunction with any routine patrol operation or to support
criminal investigations. Reasonable suspicion or probable cause is not required before
using an ALPR database.
(c) Partial license plates and unique vehicle descriptions reported during crimes may be
entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect vehicles.
(d) No member of this department shall operate ALPR equipment or access ALPR data
without first completing department-approved training.
(e) If feasible, the officer should verify an ALPR response through the California Law
Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) before taking enforcement action
that is based solely on an ALPR alert. Once an alert is received, the operator should
confirm that the observed license plate from the system matches the license plate of
the observed vehicle. Before any law enforcement action is taken because of an ALPR
alert, the alert will be verified through a CLETS inquiry via MDT or through Dispatch.
(f) Members will not take any police action that restricts the freedom of any individual
based solely on an ALPR alert unless it has been validated. Because the ALPR alert
may relate to a vehicle and may not relate to the person operating the vehicle, officers
are reminded that they need to have reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause to
make an enforcement stop of any vehicle. (For example, if a vehicle is entered into the
system because of its association with a wanted individual, Officers should attempt to
visually match the driver to the description of the wanted subject prior to making the
stop or should have another legal basis for making the stop.)
(g) Hot Lists. Designation of hot lists to be utilized by the ALPR system shall be made by
the ALPR Administrator or his/her designee. Hot lists shall be obtained or compiled
from sources as may be consistent with the purposes of the ALPR system set forth
in this Policy. Hot lists utilized by the Department's LPR system may be updated by
agency sources more frequently than the Department may be uploading them and thus
the Department's LPR system will not have access to real time data. Occasionally,
there may be errors in the LPR system's read of a license plate. Therefore, an
alert alone shall not be a basis for police action (other than following the vehicle of
interest). Prior to initiation of a stop of a vehicle or other intervention based on an alert,
Department members shall undertake the following:
1. Verification of status on a Hot List. An officer must receive confirmation, from
a Berkeley Police Department Communications Dispatcher or other department
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. Surveillance Use Policy-Fixed Automated
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department License Plate Readers (ALPRs) - 929Berkeley Police Department
Law Enforcement Manual
Law Enforcement Manual
Surveillance Use Policy-Fixed Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)
computer device, that the license plate is still stolen, wanted, or otherwise of interest
before proceeding (absent exigent circumstances).
2. Visual verification of license plate number. Officers shall visually verify that the license
plate of interest matches identically with the image of the license plate number
captured (read) by the LPR, including both the alphanumeric characters of the license
plate, state of issue, and vehicle descriptors before proceeding. Department members
alerted to the fact that an observed motor vehicle's license plate is entered as a
Hot Plate (hit) in a specific BOLO (be on the lookout) list are required to make a
reasonable effort to confirm that a wanted person is actually in the vehicle and/or that
a reasonable basis exists before a Department member would have a lawful basis to
stop the vehicle.
3. Department members will clear all stops from hot list alerts by indicating the positive
ALPR Hit, i.e., with an arrest or other enforcement action. If it is not obvious in the text
of the call as to the correlation of the ALPR Hit and the arrest, then the Department
member shall update with the Communications Dispatcher and original person and/or
a crime analyst inputting the vehicle in the hot list (hit).
4. General Hot Lists (SVS, SFR, and SLR) will be automatically downloaded into the
ALPR system a minimum of once a day with the most current data overwriting the
old data.
5. All entries and updates of specific Hot Lists within the ALPR system will be
documented by the requesting Department member within the appropriate general
offense report. As such, specific Hot Lists shall be approved by the ALPR
Administrator.
6. Administrator (or his/her designee) before initial entry within the ALPR system. The
updating of such a list within the ALPR system shall thereafter be accomplished
pursuant to the approval of the Department member's immediate supervisor. The hits
from these data sources should be viewed as informational; created solely to bring the
officers attention to specific vehicles that have been associated with criminal activity.
All Hot Plates and suspect information entered into the ALPR system will contain
the following information as a minimum:
o Entering Department member's name
o Related case number.
o Short synopsis describing the nature of the originating call
(a) Login/Log-Out Procedure. To ensure proper operation and facilitate oversight of the
ALPR system, all users will be required to have individual credentials for access and
use of the systems and/or data, which has the ability to be fully audited.
Permitted/Impermissible Uses. The ALPR system, and all data collected, is the property of the
Berkeley Police Department. Department personnel may only access and use the ALPR system
for official and legitimate California law enforcement purposes consistent with this Policy. The
following uses of the ALPR system are specifically prohibited:

1. Invasion of Privacy: Except when done pursuant to a court order such as a search
warrant, is a violation of this Policy to utilize the ALPR to record license plates except
those of vehicles that are exposed to public view (e.g., vehicles on a public road or
street, or that are on private property but whose license plate(s) are visible from a
public road, street, or a place to which members of the public have access, such as
the parking lot of a shop or other business establishment).
2. Harassment or Intimidation: It is a violation of this Policy to use the ALPR system to
harass and/or intimidate any individual or group.
3. Use Based on a Protected Characteristic. It is a violation of this policy to use the LPR
system or associated scan files or hot lists solely because of a person's, or group's
race, gender, religion, political affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
disability, or other classification protected by law.
4. Personal Use: It is a violation of this Policy to use the ALPR system or associated
scan files or hot lists for any personal purpose.
5. First Amendment Rights. It is a violation of this policy to use the LPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists for the purpose or known effect of infringing upon
First Amendment rights.
(a) Anyone who intentionally engages in an impermissible use of the ALPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists shall be subject to administrative sanctions, up
to and including termination, pursuant to and consistent with the relevant collective
bargaining agreements and departmental policies. Partial license plates reported
during crimes may be entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect
vehicles.
(a) Anyone who negligently engages in an impermissible use of the ALPR system or
associated scan files or hot lists may be subject to administrative sanctions, up to
and including termination, pursuant to and consistent with the relevant collective
bargaining agreements and departmental policies. Partial license plates reported
during crimes may be entered into the ALPR system in an attempt to identify suspect
vehicles.
No ALPR operator may access California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System
(CLETS) data unless otherwise authorized to do so. If practicable, the officer should verify an
ALPR response through the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS)
before taking enforcement action that is based solely on an ALPR alert.
1305.4 DATA COLLECTION
The Investigations Division Captain is responsible for ensuring systems and processes are in
place for the proper collection and retention of ALPR data. Data will be transferred from vehicles
to the designated storage in accordance with department procedures. Evidentiary hit data shall
be transferred into the Department's digital evidence repository through secure integration.
All ALPR data downloaded to the ALPR server should be stored for no longer than 30 days, and

1502.18 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: SEIZURE OF PROPERTY
People v. Tran (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1: Under what circumstances may a police officer seize a
digital
device pending an application for a search warrant?
RULE: Law enforcement may seize a digital device to prevent the destruction or loss of evidence
pending
an application for a search warrant.
1502.19 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: DETENTION OF SUSPECT ON FOOT
People v. Flores (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 617: Can a person be detained solely based on the facts
that they are in a high-crime area and fled from law enforcement?
RULE: Flight from a high-crime area is not sufficient, on its own, to establish a reasonable
suspicion to detain.
1502.20 CASE LAW: DETENTION VIA VEHICLE STOP
People v. Tacardon (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 89: Was a suspect detained when an officer made
a U-turn, parked 15-20 feet behind the suspect’s legally parked car, turned his spotlight onto the
suspect’s car, and immediately got out and approached?

RULE: When an officer parks a marked patrol car behind a legally parked car and illuminates the
car with a spotlight, the driver may well feel he or she is “the object of official scrutiny,” but such
directed scrutiny does not amount to a detention.
1502.21 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: REASONABLE SUSPICION FOR VEHICLE
STOPS
Kansas v. Glover (2020) 140 S.Ct. 1183: If an officer runs a license plate and learns that the
registered owner’s driver’s license was suspended or revoked, may the officer stop the vehicle to
confirm that the driver was the registered owner and, therefore, citable?
RULE: If the registered owner’s license of a vehicle has been revoked or suspended, a vehicle
stop is reasonable unless the officer has information (e.g., wrong sex or wrong race) negating the
inference that the owner is the driver.
1502.22 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: VEHICLE SEARCH- MARIJUANA,
PROBABLE CAUSE, AND THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION
People v. Shumake (2019) 45 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1: May officers search a vehicle upon finding
cannabis flower in a closed container in the center console of a vehicle?
RULE: (1) Automobile exception permitting warrantless search applies when there is probable
cause to believe evidence of a crime or contraband may be found; (2) Veh. Code, § 2322 prohibits
possession of loose cannabis flowers “not in a container” while driving a motor vehicle.
2. FACTS: An officer conducted a traffic stop; Def. was driver. Officer noticed a strong smell of
marijuana, both fresh and burnt, coming from his car. The officer asked Def. if he had marijuana,
and he stated that he had “some bud” in the center console. The officer searched the car and
discovered 1.14 grams of “dried flower” marijuana in a closed tube in the center console. Upon
further search, the officer discovered a loaded pistol under the driver’s seat.
3. HELD: Reversed. Vehicle Code, § 23222 prohibits the possession of “loose cannabis flower
not in a container” while driving a motor vehicle. Because Def. possessed cannabis flower in a
closed container, the possession was lawful and could not be relied upon to justify the search.
Absent the discovery of the cannabis, there was no probable cause to search the vehicle under
the automobile exception, and the firearm would not have been inevitably discovered.
1502.23 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: VEHICLE SEARCH- MARIJUANA,
PROBABLE CAUSE, AND THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION
People v. McGee (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 796: Did officers have probable cause to search the
vehicle after observing, in plain view, an open container of marijuana?
RULE: The presence of an unsealed bag of marijuana plainly visible on a passenger’s person
constitutes probable cause to search the vehicle, including containers.
2. FACTS: Officers initiated a traffic stop of the car Def. was driving for expired registration.
After Def. pulled over, one officer approached the driver’s side of the car and encountered Def.,
while his partner approached the passenger’s side and encountered a female passenger. As they

2021 Legislative Update
approached the car, both officers noted the scent of unburned marijuana. When asked about the
scent, Def. denied having any marijuana in the car; however, the officer speaking with the female
passenger saw an unsealed bag of marijuana in her cleavage. The officers searched the vehicle.
On the passenger floorboard was a zipped purse, and inside was a loaded handgun. After Miranda
warnings, Def. (a felon) admitted the gun was his and that he had placed it in the passenger’s
purse when he saw the officers behind his car.
3. HELD: Conviction affirmed. The search of the vehicle, including the passenger’s purse, was
justified pursuant to the automobile exception. While the mere presence of a lawful amount of
marijuana is not sufficient to establish probable cause to search under the automobile exception,
and there must be some additional evidence of illegality, here there was sufficient additional
evidence because the officer observed an open container on the passenger’s person (and
possession of an unsealed or open container of marijuana in a vehicle is still illegal, no
matter the amount). The presence of this contraband provided probable cause to believe the
passenger possessed other open containers, and therefore the officers had probable cause to
search the passenger and the vehicle for further evidence of contraband.
1502.24 CASE LAW: FOURTH AMENDMENT: VEHICLE SEARCH- MARIJUANA,
PROBABLE CAUSE, AND THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION
People v. Lee (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 853: Does the seizure of a small amount of marijuana from
Def.’s person constitute probable cause to search a vehicle? When may law enforcement impound
a vehicle when a driver’s license is suspended?
RULE: The warrantless search of a vehicle is allowed: (1) under the automobile exception when
there is probable cause to believe evidence of a crime or contraband may be found; or (2) during
a vehicle inventory properly conducted in the course of impounding an automobile. A vehicle may
be impounded only if it serves a community caretaking function.
2. FACTS: When Def. failed to produce a license after a traffic stop and exiting the vehicle,
officers conducted a pat-down search and found a small amount of marijuana and cash in Def.’s
pocket. When the officer began to handcuff him, Def. tensed up and leaned back in the car to tell
something to his passenger. The officers learned that Def. was driving on a suspended license.
They handcuffed Def., detained the passenger, and proceeded to search Def.’s car, telling Def.
they were going to impound the vehicle due to his suspended license. During the search, officers
found cocaine, a gun, and indicia of drug sales. Def. was charged with drug-and-weapon-related
offenses and moved to suppress the evidence. The prosecution argued that the search was
justified as an automobile search and a vehicle inventory prior to its impound.
3. HELD: Reversed. The officers lacked probable cause under the automobile exception. Finding a
small (legal) amount of marijuana and money on Def. did not provide a reasonable basis to believe
contraband would be found in the car. There was no evidence that would cause a reasonable
person to believe the Def. had more marijuana than the legal amount he possessed (e.g. no odor,
open container, or signs of illegal sales activity).

Law Enforcement Manual
2021 Legislative Update
The decision to impound the vehicle was not justified because no community caretaking function
was served by impounding the car. The car was parked in or next to an apartment complex. It
was not blocking a roadway, the sidewalk, or a driveway. And the trial court reasonably found the
officer’s primary motive was to investigate, rather than inventory, the car.
• A motive to impound the vehicle was belied by how the search was conducted and the officer’s
repeated questions to Def. about whether there was anything illegal inside the vehicle. The
officer who performed the search did not complete a required San Diego Police Department form
(ARJIS-11) for towing and impound. And he did not assist the officer who ultimately completed
the vehicle inventory (after discovery of the contraband).
• Although the Vehicle Code authorizes law enforcement to impound a car when a person is
found to be driving on a suspended license, “the fact that an inventory search is authorized is not
determinative of the search’s constitutionality.”

Manual published by the California Peace Officers' Association is the main source used for this
summary. All personnel are invited to click on the links within this document and read the various
codes in their entirety for a more detailed explanation. The changes outlined below go into effect
January 1, 2023, unless otherwise indicated.

prioritized ranking for the Police Accountability Board to consider in determining
the order in which to perform its review per the Police Equipment and
Community Safety Ordinance.
M4 Rifle and Associated Ammunition
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The “M4” was developed and produced for the United States government by Colt
Firearms and was based off of the original Armalite Rifle (AR) patent purchased
by Colt in 1959. Although Colt owned the trademarked name of “M4”, a number
of other manufacturers offer M4-like firearms under various model names. The
M4 and its variants fire 5.56×45mm NATO (and .223 Remington) ammunition,
and are a gas-operated, magazine-fed firearm with a barrel length ranging from
11.5” to 16”.
The current Berkeley Police Department (BPD) rifle ammunition used is the .223
Remington, a rimless, bottlenecked rifle cartridge. The round was developed in
1957 by Remington Arms and Fairchild Industries. The .223 Remington is
considered one of the most popular cartridges and is currently used by a wide
range of semi-automatic and manual-action rifles as well as handguns. While the
military uses the similar 5.56x45 NATO cartridge, BPD uses the more common
and often regarded civilian cartridge of .223 Remington for all training and duty
uses.
Currently, BPD uses two different kinds of .223 Remington ammunition: 55 grain
FMJ (full metal jacket) for training purposes and 62 grain soft point for duty
purposes. This is done for several reasons.
1. FMJ ammunition is cheaper to purchase. While many agencies use
the same ammunition for training and duty use, the department
saves a significant amount of money by using FMJ ammunition for
training.
2. The observed performance between the two rounds is negligible for
training purposes. Officers can use the FMJ ammunition in a
training course and see no difference in operation and performance
versus using 62 grain soft point duty ammunition.
3. The 62-grain soft point ammunition has been shown to have less
over penetration and over travel compared to FMJ ammunition.
3 | P ageInternal
This means that rounds fired are less likely to hit unintended
targets.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Department currently owns and maintains 96 rifles.
Quantity of rifle ammunition fluctuates significantly depending on training
attended, including the standard basic police academy, officer assignments, and
yearly mandate training cycles. For example, most police academy recruits are
required to bring approximately 1,000 rounds to the basic POST approved
academy. Most academies have a 16-24-hour rifle training course. The training is
required for all officers who are issued a rifle and mandates between 800 and
1,200 rounds. As such, the inventory at the Berkeley Police Department
fluctuates significantly depending on how many officers are attending state
mandated training and can range from 10,000 round (our current inventory) to
less than 1,000 rounds (our anticipated inventory at the end of December after
scheduled department training in November.)
C. Capability:
The M4 pattern rifle is used only in situations when a potential life-threatening
situation exists. While a pistol is the common firearm used by police in these
dangerous situations, the M4 patterned rifle has numerous advantages over it.
The ability to shoulder the rifle, coupled with the rifle’s lengthened barrel and
ammunition, result in higher accuracy and lessens the chance of officers missing
the intended target. Additionally, due to the design of the rifle’s bullet, the
round is less likely to over penetrate commercial and residential walls should the
officer miss the intended target. The rifle is also easier to use compared to a
pistol because of the bullet’s low recoil. Finally, as the rifle can be adjusted and
customized, it can be configured to accommodate officers of any stature (hand
size, strength, etc.).
The .223 Remington cartridge, depending on the weight of the bullet, 55 grain or
62 grain, travel at approximately 3,000 feet per second and 2,700 feet per second
respectively. The round is highly regarded as having a high degree of consistency
and accuracy, which is why it is the most common rifle round used in Law
Enforcement around the world.
D. Lifespan:
Due to the rifle’s ability to be maintained by department armorers, these rifles
have a relatively long-life span if properly maintained. However, the design has
4 | P ageInternal
changed little in the last 60 years and we can expect new variations and designs
to become the new industry standard in the coming years.
Like all ammunition, if kept cool and dry, ammunition lifespan can exceed ten
years. Due to BPD’s and State mandates on training, the majority of ammunition
is cycled through within a year of purchase.
E. Use:
Used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims of violent
crimes, general public, and officers.
F. How it Works:
The M4 patterned rifle works the same as a majority of all modern firearms.
When the trigger is pressed, a firing pin strikes the primer of a bullet loaded into
the chamber of the rifle. The ignited primer ignites gun powder contained in the
bullet which pushes the bullet down the barrel and out the muzzle. As the bullet
travels down the barrel, gas from the ignited powder also escapes from the
muzzle. Some of that gas is recycled back into the chamber of the firearm which
causes the firearm to cycle its action and load another bullet. From there the
process repeats with each pull of the trigger.
The .223 Remington cartridge is made up of several parts, primarily the primer,
casing, gunpowder, and bullet. The bullet is seated into the front or opening of
the casing. Gunpowder is placed between the bullet and the interior of the
casing and a primer is seated in the rear part of the casing. When the trigger of a
firearm is pulled, it releases the hammer, which strikes the firing pin, driving it
forward. The firing pin collides with the rear of the cartridge, where the primer is
seated, which ignites the primer. The spark from the primer ignites the
gunpowder. Gas converted from the burning powder rapidly expands in the
cartridge. The expanding gas forces the bullet out of the cartridge and down the
barrel with great speed. The rifling in the barrel causes the bullet to spin as it
travels out of the barrel. The bullet's speed and escaping gases produce a "bang."
After the bullet exits the barrel, the spent casing which housed the bullet,
gunpowder, and primer are ejected from the firearm.
(2) Purpose:
The M4 patterned rifle and associated ammunition is intended as a means to safely
stop a lethal threat. While a pistol is the firearm that all officers are minimally
5 | P ageInternal
equipped with, the rifle is an ancillary firearm for situations where increased
distance and accuracy are needed to safely resolve the situation.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Rifle prices, like other firearms, will range depending on current market demand
and availability. While M4 rifles purchased several years ago cost between
$1,000 and $1,200 a piece, current rifles cost between $1,400 and $1,600. It
should be expected that these prices will fluctuate and likely increase over time.
Ammunition costs fluctuate with the costs of components (brass, primers,
gunpowder, and bullets) and supply/demand. Current costs for .223 Remington
range from $0.50 to $0.75 a round for training ammunition (55 grain) and $1.25
to $1.50 a round for duty ammunition (62 grain).
B. Cost of Use:
Cost of use for all firearms should be based on the ammunition used in training
and on duty. This will fluctuate based on whether the rifle is issued to a patrol
officer, a firearms instructor, or a Special Response Team member as each
assignment has different training requirements.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of a firearm are not calculable. It could lead to
the loss of life or serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in
civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See section B. above, these costs are determined based on the rifle’s assignment.
E. Training Costs:
Every officer that is authorized to carry a rifle on duty must attend a 16-hour CA
POST approved rifle instruction course before being authorized to carry the rifle
on duty. This course may be administered by Berkeley Police Firearm Instructors
or by other POST approved agencies. Tuition for the CA POST approved class is
dependent on the hosting agency. If conducted in house the cost only includes
the officer’s hourly wage, range fee, and ammunition costs (all vary). Outside
agencies charge between $25 to $500 depending on the range location and
duration (some classes are 32-hours while POST only requires 16-hours.)
Additionally, all officers issued a rifle receive specific 8-hour rifle training every
two years by POST certified BPD firearm instructors.
6 | P ageInternal
Typical round count for such classes range between 800 rounds and 1200 rounds
per student. Additionally, all officers issued a rifle receive specific 8-hour rifle
training every two years by a BPD firearm instructor which constitutes an
additional 500 or so rounds per officer.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use over time. Traditionally, various
springs and pins need to be replaced every five years and may cost between $3
and $30 per rifle. Other parts such as the barrel and bolt need replaced around
ten years and range between $150 and $300 per rifle.
There are no costs associated with maintenance or storage of ammunition. All
ammunition is stored in a climate-controlled room in the Berkeley Police
Department.
G. Upgrade Costs:
Upgrade costs and Maintenance cost are synonymous due to the consistent
design and lack of changes of the rifle over the last 60 years. Improvements in
technology and new designs may be an additional cost but we can’t predict what
those will be at this time.
Should advancements be made in ammunition manufacturing, those upgrade
costs are unknown at this time.
(4) Impact:
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to preserving and protecting human
life and welfare. The M4 patterned rifle, which fires the .223 Remington cartridge, is
a superior firearm to stop a lethal threat compared to the issued pistols to police
officers, in that officers equipped with this firearm shoot less rounds, fire more
accurately, and are less likely to fire errant rounds. Highly volatile and violent
incidents, such as a hostage situation, can be more safely and efficiently resolved
with a rifle.
The M4 patterned rifle, and the accompanying .223 Remington cartridge it fires, is
intended as a tool to increase the safety and welfare of citizens and officers alike.
The M4 patterned rifle and .223 Remington cartridge, both inanimate objects, have
zero impact on things such as civil rights or civil liberties of the public. Any abuses of
authority or power would be the result of an individual who violates the Berkeley
Police Department’s policies, including state and federal laws.
7 | P ageInternal
(5) Mitigations:
Per Policy 300, “Deadly force may only be used when it is objectively reasonable that
such action is immediately necessary to protect the officer or another person from
imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.
Officers shall not use deadly force if it is objectively reasonable that alternative
techniques will eliminate the imminent danger and ultimately achieve the law
enforcement purpose with less risk of harm to the officer or to other persons.”
(6) Alternatives:
There are no suitable alternatives to the M4 rifle for the intended purpose. The M4
rifle is a law enforcement standard across the US and other countries due to its
reliability, ease of use, ease of maintenance, and increased accuracy over other
options.
There are no suitable alternatives to the .223 Remington cartridge, as the current
BPD M4 rifle is designed for that particular cartridge. The .223 Remington cartridge
is a law enforcement standard across the US and other countries due to its reliability,
availability, and increased accuracy over other options.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
Berkeley Police Department armorers are trained and capable to handle any and all
issues related to the maintenance or repair of the M4 rifles. Additionally, BPD
firearm instructors are fully certified by state and private training institutes to fully
educate and train BPD officers. No third party is required for maintenance, repair, or
instruction.
All ammunition purchased by BPD, like all equipment, is dependent on Third Party
vendors. Vendor stock and availability is outside BPD control or management. Once
ammunition is purchased and in BPD custody there is no additional need for Third
Party assistance.
Penn Arms 40mm Single Launcher
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The 40mm impact projectile was developed as an alternative to the 12-gauge
bean bag round and other more indiscriminate less lethal options. Early 12-gauge
8 | P ageInternal
bean bag round designs had somewhat unpredictable flight patterns and could
cause significant unwanted injury. The 40mm foam baton round was developed
as a direct fire projectile designed to minimize the risk of unintended injuries.
Currently, the Berkeley Police Department utilizes the CTS 4557 foam baton
projectile and the Penn Arms L-140 single shot launcher.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department currently owns and maintains 20 Penn Arms less
lethal launchers.
C. Capability:
The Penn Arms single launcher is capable of firing a single projectile out to a
maximum manufacturer recommended range of 45 meters. The Penn Arms
40mm projectiles are direct fire with a pliable “sponge” tip designed to mold to
the body. The projectiles are about the size of a large egg. Upon impact, the
projectile transfers kinetic energy to the body to gain pain compliance. Large
muscle groups such as the upper legs or lower abdomen are approved target
areas unless a higher level of force is justified. This level of force is considered to
be similar to that of a baton strike.
D. Lifespan:
The manufacturer expected lifespan is about 10 years depending on use and
regular maintenance.
E. Use:
The Penn Arms 40mm single launcher is designed to reduce the potential for a
violent confrontation. Less lethal projectiles are less likely to result in serious
bodily injury or death and can be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly
situation.
F. How it works:
The Penn Arms 40mm single launcher is a double action, break open less lethal
launcher. The launcher is capable of firing a single 40mm projectile. When fired,
the hammer strikes the munition primer which ignites gun powder in the primer
insert. Expelled gases propel the projectile through the rifled barrel. The
projectile has a rear plastic portion called the ogive which catches the barrel
rifling and provides spin. The spin provides a greater degree of accuracy and
eliminates any potential the projectile will tumble when exiting the barrel.
9 | P ageInternal
The projectiles utilized by the Berkeley Police Department are the CTS 4557
40mm sponge baton round. The CTS 4557 has a maximum effective range of 45
meters. The tip of the projectile is a pliable rubber material which molds to the
body upon impact. The projectile travels at an estimated 240 feet per second
which is slower than the FN 303 projectile. However, the larger mass, about 60
grams, creates more kinetic energy upon impact which is similar to that of a
baseball thrown by a pitcher. The additional kinetic energy becomes important
when the suspect has on thick or layered clothing or demonstrates a high pain
tolerance.
The Penn Arms single launcher is a basic design making it easy to operate and
maintain.
(2) Purpose:
The purpose of kinetic energy impact projectiles, commonly referred to as “less
lethal” is to preserve life, minimize the use of force and allow time for de-escalation.
Less lethal projectiles allow the user to maintain a safe distance from a subject who
is armed and/or demonstrates the intent to be violent. The ability to maintain a safe
distance – while still providing a level of control over the subject – allows officers to
employ de-escalation techniques, request additional resources and develop a plan to
safely resolve the situation with the least amount of risk.
Violent or armed confrontations are inherently dangerous to all those involved.
Officers are required to make split second judgments in circumstances that are
tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving. An Officer’s threat perception of a person who
is in close proximity as opposed to a person who is at a distance of 20 yards is
naturally different. A person in close proximity intent on violence has the ability to
immediately utilize personal body weapons, a bludgeoning device or cutting
instrument. The immediacy requires the Officer to react instantly and there is a
greater potential that a higher level of force will be needed.
On the other hand, a person at a distance of 20 yards may not be perceived as
having the immediate ability to violently attack the Officer. The person must first
close the distance before certain weapons can be utilized. This fact may allow the
Officer time to decide the most appropriate course of action, such as the use of a
“less lethal” projectile.
The projectiles are designed to provide a high level of accuracy which minimizes the
risk of unwanted impacts. The ability to apply force from a distance reduces the
10 | P ageInternal
potential for violent confrontation and aides in reducing the level of force needed to
safely resolve a conflict.
Additionally, it has been our experience that a 40mm projectile impact will almost
always resolve a violent confrontation with 1 or 2 applications. The larger projectile
produces more kinetic energy than the FN 303, which may require several
applications to gain compliance.
Since 2015, there have been 31 incidents where Officers utilized less lethal
applications. These applications have potentially prevented higher-level uses of
force.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Less lethal prices, like other equipment, varies depending on market demand and
availability. The most recent Penn Arms purchased by the department cost
$815.00 each.
B. Cost of Use:
Cost for Penn Arms single launcher use should be based on the projectiles used in
training and on duty. This will fluctuate based on department trainings, projectile
availability and events that unfold in the city and surrounding region.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects from improper use of less lethal are not calculable. Improper use
could lead to serious bodily injury or death.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See section B above
E. Training Costs:
Every officer authorized to deploy a less lethal launcher must pass a certification
course administered by a Berkeley Police Department Firearms Instructor. The
certification class consists of classroom, range qualification and scenario
application if the venue allows. This class is largely handled in house thus the cost
only includes staff time, range fees, and projectile costs which all vary.
11 | P ageInternal
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use. Generally, various springs and pins
need to be replaced every 5 years which can cost $3 to $30.
G. Upgrade Costs:
There are no foreseeable upgrade costs. The Penn Arms single launcher has few
working parts and is of a simple design.
(4) Impact:
The main function of a less lethal device is to preserve the sanctity of human life. The
Berkeley Police Department is committed to reducing the potential for violent
confrontations. Less lethal projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in
serious bodily injury or death and can be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly
situation. A less lethal application is an acknowledgment a given situation has the
potential to elevate to lethal force and the Officers determined a less lethal
application is not only objectively reasonable and objectively necessary, but
hopefully the minimal amount of force needed to safely resolve the incident.
The Penn Arms single launcher, with its high level of accuracy can be utilized in a
large violent group confrontation to specifically target those who are committing
acts of violence on other members of the group, involved persons, or law
enforcement personnel. It allows a more immediate action to stop a violent assault,
overcome their resistance, and aid in the attempt to safely take them into custody.
This tool does not require officers to overcome a hostile crowd to stop a violent
assault.
(5) Mitigation:
Per Policy 300, “In all cases where physical force is used, officers shall use a
minimum amount of force that is objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and
proportional to effectively and safely resolve a conflict.” All uses of force require
documentation that is completed by the supervisor in a use of force report and
reviewed by the Chain of Command. Furthermore, all deployments of equipment
outlined in the Police Equipment and Community Safety Ordinance are documented
according to the reporting requirements as mandated in the ordinance.
Per Policy 303, “Officers are not required or compelled to use approved projectiles in
lieu of other reasonable tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of
these projectiles cannot be done safely. Circumstances appropriate for deployment
include, but are not limited to, situations in which: (a) The suspect is armed with a
weapon and the tactical circumstances allow for the safe application of approved
12 | P ageInternal
projectiles. (b) The suspect has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others.
(c) The suspect is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other
dangerous projectiles at people and/or officers. (d) There is probable cause to
believe that the suspect has already committed a crime of violence and is refusing to
comply with lawful orders.”
The Berkeley Police Department also trains a recommended range of 3 to 30 meters.
Berkeley Police Firearm Instructors recommend a minimum standoff of 3 meters to
reduce the potential for unintended injury at a closer distance. The 30-meter
maximum recommended range is intended to reduce the possibility of an
unintended impact area if the suspect moves or the projectile trajectory begins to
deteriorate.
Each officer is trained to aim for large muscle groups, such as the thigh or buttocks
area, and avoid areas that may cause serious injury. The department also equips
each launcher with a red dot optic. The optic greatly increases an officer’s ability to
target approved impact areas.
(6) Alternative:
This is the only piece of less lethal equipment (other than the FN 303) that allows
officers to address a potentially deadly threat from a distance. The TASER allows an
officer to maintain distance but limits the range to about 15 to 25 feet. Furthermore,
the TASER requires two prongs (barbs) to penetrate the subject’s clothing to be
effective and if that is not accomplished the TASER will have no effect. Additionally,
the TASER is not an approved less lethal device for the department.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
The Berkeley Police Department armorers are trained and capable of handling all
issues related to the repair or maintenance of the Penn Arms single launcher.
Additionally, Berkeley Police Department Less Lethal Instructors are fully certified by
state and private training institutes to educate and train BPD officers. No third party
is required for maintenance, repair, or instruction.
Milkor LTL Multi-launcher
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The 40mm impact projectile was developed as an alternative to the 12-gauge
bean bag round and other more indiscriminate less lethal options. Early 12-gauge
13 | P ageInternal
bean bag round designs had somewhat unpredictable flight patterns and could
cause significant unwanted injury. The 40mm foam baton round was developed
as a direct fire projectile designed to minimize the risk of unintended injuries.
Currently, the Berkeley Police Department utilizes the CTS 4557 foam baton
projectile and the Milkor LTL multi-shot launcher.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department currently owns and maintains 2 Milkor LTL less
lethal launchers. One Milkor launcher is assigned to the Berkeley Special
Response Team.
C. Capability:
The Milkor LTL is capable of firing six 40mm projectiles before reloading is
necessary. The Milkor LTL 40mm projectiles are direct fire with a pliable “sponge”
tip designed to mold to the body. The projectiles are about the size of a large egg.
Upon impact, the projectile transfers kinetic energy to the body to gain pain
compliance. Large muscle groups such as the upper legs or lower abdomen are
approved target areas unless a higher level of force is justified. This level of force
is considered to be similar to that of a baton strike.
D. Lifespan:
The manufacturer expected lifespan is about 10 to 15 years depending on use
and regular maintenance.
E. Use:
The Milkor LTL multi-shot launcher is designed to reduce the potential for a
violent confrontation. Less lethal projectiles are less likely to result in serious
bodily injury or death and can be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly
situation.
F. How it works:
The Milkor LTL multi-shot launcher utilizes a spring actuated cylinder allowing it
to fire 6 individual 40mm projectiles. When fired, the hammer strikes the
munition primer which ignites gun powder in the primer insert. Expelled gases
propel the projectile through the rifled barrel. The projectile has a rear plastic
portion called the ogive which catches the barrel rifling and provides spin. The
spin provides a greater degree of accuracy and eliminates any potential the
projectile will tumble when exiting the barrel. The spring assisted cylinder
automatically turns and loads the next projectile.
14 | P ageInternal
The projectiles utilized by the Berkeley Police Department are the CTS 4557
40mm sponge baton round. The CTS 4557 has a maximum effective range of 45
meters. The tip of the projectile is a pliable rubber material which molds to the
body upon impact. The projectile travels at an estimated 240 feet per second
which is slower than FN 303 projectile. However, the larger mass, about 60
grams, creates more kinetic energy upon impact which is similar to that of a
baseball thrown by a pitcher. The additional kinetic energy becomes important
when the suspect has on thick or layered clothing or demonstrates a high pain
tolerance.
The benefit to the Milkor LTL is its ability to provide a quick follow up less lethal
application, if necessary. The Milkor holds 6 projectiles while the Penn Arms
launcher only holds one. Reloading the Penn Arms single launcher can be time
consuming and requires the officer to briefly change focus from the suspect to
the reload procedure. The Milkor LTL on the other hand, allows the officer to
maintain focus on the suspect and assess whether a follow up application is
necessary. This ability is significant when the suspect is advancing, attempting to
flee, or demonstrates a high pain compliance threshold.
(2) Purpose:
The purpose of kinetic energy impact projectiles, commonly referred to as “less
lethal” is to preserve life, minimize the use of force and allow time for de-escalation
attempts. Less lethal projectiles allow the user to maintain a safe distance from a
subject who is armed and/or demonstrates the intent to be violent. The ability to
maintain a safe distance – while still providing a level of control over the subject –
allows officers to employ de-escalation techniques, request additional resources and
develop a plan to safely resolve the situation with the least amount of risk.
Violent confrontations are inherently dangerous to all those involved. Officers are
required to make split second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain
and rapidly evolving. An Officer’s threat perception of a person who is in close
proximity as opposed to a person who is at a distance of 20 yards is naturally
different. A person in close proximity intent on violence has the ability to
immediately utilize personal body weapons, a bludgeoning device or cutting
instrument. The immediacy requires the Officer to react instantly and there is a
greater potential that a higher level of force will be needed.
On the other hand, a person at a distance of 20 yards may not be perceived as
having the immediate ability to violently attack the Officer. The person must first
close the distance before such weapons can be utilized. This may allow the Officer
15 | P ageInternal
time to decide the most appropriate course of action, such as the use of a “less
lethal” projectile.
The “less lethal” projectiles utilized by the Berkeley Police Department are generally
considered discriminate versus indiscriminate uses of force. The projectiles are
designed to provide a high level of accuracy which minimizes the risk of unwanted
impacts. The ability to apply force from a distance reduces the potential for violent
confrontation and aides in reducing the level of force needed to safely resolve a
conflict.
Additionally, it has been our experience that a 40mm projectile impact will generally
resolve the violent confrontation with 1 or 2 applications. The larger projectile
produces more kinetic energy than the FN 303, which may require several
applications to gain compliance.
Since 2015, there have been 31 incidents where Officers utilized less lethal
applications. These applications have potentially prevented higher-level uses of
force.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Less lethal prices, like other equipment, varies depending on market demand and
availability. The most recent Penn Arms purchased by the department cost
$3950.00 each.
B. Cost of Use:
Cost for the Milkor LTL launcher use should be based on the projectiles used in
training and on duty. This will fluctuate based on department trainings, projectile
availability and events that unfold in the city and surrounding region.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects from improper use of less lethal are not calculable. Improper use
could lead to serious bodily injury or death.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See section B above
E. Training Costs:
Every officer authorized to deploy a less lethal launcher must pass a certification
course administered by a Berkeley Police Firearm Instructor. The certification
16 | P ageInternal
class consists of classroom, range qualification and scenario application if the
venue allows. This class is largely handled in house thus the cost only includes the
officer’s hourly wage, range fees, and projectile costs which all vary.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use.
G. Upgrade Costs:
There are no foreseeable upgrade costs.
(4) Impact:
The main function of a less lethal device is to preserve the sanctity of human life. The
Berkeley Police Department is committed to reducing the potential for violent
confrontations. Less lethal projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in
serious bodily injury or death and can be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly
situation. A less lethal application is an acknowledgment a given situation has the
potential to elevate to lethal force and the Officers determined a less lethal
application is not only objectively reasonable and objectively necessary, but also the
minimal amount of force needed to safely resolve the incident.
The Milkor LTL launcher, with its high level of accuracy and 6 projectile capacity, can
be utilized in a large violent group confrontation to specifically target those who are
committing acts of violence on other members of the group, involved persons, or
law enforcement personnel. It allows a more immediate action to stop a violent
assault, overcome their resistance, and aid in the attempt to safely take them into
custody. It also allows officers to prevent a more indiscriminate use of force, such as
entering the group or crowd, to take a subject into custody.
(5) Mitigation:
Per Policy 300, “In all cases where physical force is used, officers shall use a
minimum amount of force that is objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and
proportional to effectively and safely resolve a conflict.” All uses of force require
documentation that is completed by the supervisor in a use of force report and
reviewed by the Chain of Command. Furthermore, all deployments of equipment
outlined in the Police Equipment and Community Safety Ordinance are documented
according to the reporting requirements as mandated in the ordinance.
Per Policy 303, “Officers are not required or compelled to use approved projectiles in
lieu of other reasonable tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of
these projectiles cannot be done safely. The safety of hostages, innocent persons
17 | P ageInternal
and officers takes priority over the safety of subjects engaged in criminal or suicidal
behavior. Circumstances appropriate for deployment include, but are not limited to,
situations in which: (a) The suspect is armed with a weapon and the tactical
circumstances allow for the safe application of approved projectiles. (b) The suspect
has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others. (c) The suspect is engaged
in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other dangerous projectiles at
people and/or officers. (d) There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has
already committed a crime of violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.”
The Berkeley Police Department also trains a recommended range of 3 to 30 meters.
Berkeley Police Firearm Instructors recommend a minimum standoff of 3 meters to
reduce the potential for unintended injury at a closer distance. The 30-meter
maximum recommended range is intended to reduce the possibility of an
unintended impact area if the suspect moves or the projectile trajectory begins to
deteriorate.
Each officer is trained to aim for large muscle groups, such as the thigh or buttocks
area, and avoid areas that may cause serious injury. The department also equips
each launcher with a red dot optic. The optic greatly increases an officer’s ability to
target approved impact areas.
(6) Alternative:
This is the only piece of less lethal equipment (other than the FN 303) that allows
officers to address a potentially deadly threat from a distance. The TASER allows an
officer to maintain distance but limits the range to about 15 to 25 feet. Furthermore,
the TASER requires two prongs (barbs) to penetrate the subject’s clothing to be
effective and if that is not accomplished the TASER will have no effect. Additionally,
the TASER is not an approved less lethal device for the department.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
The Berkeley Police Department armorers are trained and capable of handling most
issues related to the repair or maintenance of the Milkor LTL launcher. In the event
of a catastrophic malfunction, the Milkor LTL will need to be sent to the
manufacturer for repair. To date, there have been no significant repairs needed to
the Milkor LTL. Additionally, Berkeley Police Department Less Lethal Instructors are
fully certified by state and private training institutes to educate and train BPD
officers. No third party is required for regular maintenance, repair, or instruction.

FN 303 and FN Pava Impact Projectile
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The FN 303 was developed in 2003 by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal as a less
lethal option. The FN 303 is based on a concept developed by Monterey Bay
Corporation. The development team consisted of designers and researchers from
two paintball related companies. The FN 303 uses compressed air to propel a .68
caliber projectile similar to that of most manufactured paintball guns.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department currently owns and maintains 8 FN 303 less
lethal launchers.
C. Capability:
The FN 303 is capable of firing 15 projectiles out to a maximum manufacturer
recommended range of 50 meters. The FN 303 projectiles are direct fire and
designed to fragment upon impact to prevent penetration injury. Upon impact,
the projectile transfers kinetic energy to the body to gain pain compliance. Large
muscle groups such as the upper legs or lower abdomen are approved target
areas. This level of force is considered to be similar to that of a baton strike.
D. Lifespan:
The manufacturer expected lifespan is about 10 years depending on use and
regular maintenance.
E. Use:
The FN 303 is designed to reduce the potential for a violent confrontation. Less
lethal projectiles are less likely to result in serious bodily injury or death and can
be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation.
F. How it works:
An air reservoir attaches to the FN 303 through an air hose coupler and provides
pressure through compressed air. When fired, the compressed air drives a piston
that pushes the .68 caliber projectile through the barrel at approximately 280
feet per second. For comparison, the FN projectile is the size of a paintball and
the velocity is the same as a commercially manufactured paintball gun.
The projectiles are 8.5 grams in weight and utilize a polystyrene fin stabilized
body with a non-toxic forward payload to aid in stability and accuracy. The
19 | P ageInternal
projectile will deliver approximately 24-foot pounds of kinetic energy at the
muzzle which is about double the kinetic energy of most paintball guns. Most
paintballs have a mass of 3 grams while the FN 303 projectile has a mass of 8.5
grams which increases the kinetic energy produced.
Available projectiles are impact, impact + non-permanent marking, impact +
permanent marking, and impact + PAVA (0.5% PAVA/Oleoresin Capsicum).
The impact + PAVA projectile is intended to be direct fired at an individual. In
addition to delivering pain through kinetic energy upon impact, the PAVA
projectile will deliver a secondary chemical irritant, which is the Oleoresin
Capsicum (O.C.) payload. Oleoresin Capsicum generally causes irritation/burning
at the application site, irritation to the eyes, and coughing. According to the
National Institute of Health, the effects of O.C. power exposure tend to resolve
on their own within 30 minutes.
Pain is highly subjective and other circumstances, such as heavy clothing, may
render the impact ineffective. The application of a secondary chemical irritant
may assist in gaining compliance and successfully resolving a potentially violent
incident with the minimal amount of force necessary.
(2) Purpose:
The purpose of kinetic energy impact projectiles, commonly referred to as “less
lethal” is to preserve life, minimize the use of force and allow time for de-escalation
attempts. Less lethal projectiles allow the user to maintain a safe distance from a
subject who is armed and/or demonstrates the intent to be violent. The ability to
maintain a safe distance – while still providing a level of control over the subject –
allows officers to employ de-escalation techniques, request additional resources and
develop a plan to safely resolve the situation with the least amount of risk.
Violent confrontations are inherently dangerous to all those involved. Officers are
required to make split second judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain
and rapidly evolving. An Officer’s threat perception of a person who is in close
proximity as opposed to a person who is at a distance of 20 yards is naturally

immediately utilize personal body weapons, a bludgeoning device or cutting
instrument. The immediacy requires the Officer to react instantly and there is a
greater potential that a higher level of force will be needed.
20 | P ageInternal
On the other hand, a person at a distance of 20 yards may not be perceived as
having the immediate ability to violently attack the Officer. The person must first
close the distance before such weapons can be utilized. This may allow the Officer
time to decide the most appropriate course of action, such as the use of a “less

resolve a conflict.
Since 2015, there have been 31 incidents where Officers utilized less lethal
applications. These applications have potentially prevented higher-level uses of
force.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Less lethal prices, like other equipment, varies depending on market demand and
availability. The most recent FN 303s purchased by the department cost $800.00
each.
B. Cost of Use:
Cost for FN 303 use should be based on the projectiles used in training and on
duty. This will fluctuate based on department trainings, projectile availability and
events that unfold in the city and surrounding region.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects from improper use of less lethal are not calculable. Improper use
could lead to serious bodily injury or death. Only trained officers are authorized
to use the FN 303.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See section B above
E. Training Costs:
Every officer authorized to deploy a less lethal launcher must pass a certification
course administered by a Berkeley Police Firearm Instructor. The certification
class consists of classroom, range qualification and scenario application if the
21 | P ageInternal
venue allows. This class is largely handled in house thus the cost only includes the
officer’s hourly wage, range fees, and projectile costs which all vary.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use. Generally, O-rings need to be replaced
every 3000 rounds and cost $30 per kit.
G. Upgrade Costs:
The overall design of the FN 303 has changed little since its initial release in the
early 2000s thus anticipated upgrade costs will be minimal.
(4) Impact:
The main function of a less lethal device is to preserve the sanctity of human life. The
Berkeley Police Department is committed to reducing the potential for violent
confrontations. Less lethal projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in
serious bodily injury or death and can be used to de-escalate a potentially deadly

The Berkeley Police Department also trains a recommended range of 3 to 30 meters.
Berkeley Police Firearm Instructors recommend a minimum standoff of 3 meters to
reduce the potential for unintended injury at a closer distance. The 30-meter
maximum recommended range is intended to reduce the possibility of an
unintended impact area if the suspect moves or the projectile trajectory begins to

approved less lethal device for the Berkeley Police Department.
Unlike the Penn Arms 40mm single shot and the Milkor LTL multi-shot launcher, the
FN 303 is capable of propelling 15 projectiles before a reload is required. The 15
round magazine allows for a quick follow-up application should the situation warrant
with an effective range of over 160 feet; compared to the Penn Arms 40mm single
shot and the Milkor LTL multi-shot launcher’s 100 feet. The FN303’s smaller and
faster projectiles also generally allow for a higher level of accuracy compared to the
40mm foam baton rounds. The FN 303 rounds is also capable of carrying payloads
such as paint or PAVA (Oleoresin capsicum).
23 | P ageInternal
(7) Third Party Dependence:
The Berkeley Police Department armorers are trained and capable of handling
regular maintenance and most repairs. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the
device will be sent to the manufacturer for repair. To date there have been 2 devices
that required manufacturer repair, both of which were under warranty.
Additionally, department firearm instructors are fully certified by state and private
training institutes to educate and train BPD officers. No third party is required for
maintenance, most repairs, or instruction.
OC (oleoresin capsicum) Spray
(1) Description:
A. Background:
For the purposes of this portion of the Impact Statement, OC (Oleoresin capsicum)
will be referred to in the spray form as opposed to the aerosol canister form. First
Defense manufactures different sizes of OC sprays. OC is the chemical agent that is
most widely used amongst Law Enforcement (LE) and the general public. OC has a
pungent and irritating pepper odor. It is classified as an inflammatory agent. Besides
being effective on humans, OC based chemical agents usually work on animals as
well. In a liquid form, OC can appear as a clear, amber, or heavy dark red solution
depending on the manufacturer. It is mixed with several types of solutions which act
as carriers.
B. Quantity:
Qty 23 – First Defense MK-9 OC spray (13- ounces)
Qty 178 – First Defense MK-3 OC spray (3 ounces)
Most of the MK-3 OC sprays are issued to and maintained by individual
officers; however, a small amount of these sprays is stored in a secured
equipment room as spares in case of damage or new personnel issue.
C. Capability:
The First Defense MK-3 OC sprays are standard issued to all police officers and
are worn on the police officers’ belt. It has an effective range of 10-12 feet. The
larger First Defense MK-9 OC sprays are 13 ounces and are used in violent crowd
situations. It has an effect range of 18-20 feet.
24 | P ageInternal
The use of the First Defense OC spray can render a dangerous and violent
situation safe without using a higher level of force.
D. Lifespan:
Aerosol products eventually lose pressure over time. The lifespan of both the MK-
9 and MK-3 OC spray are dependent on how well the pressure in the can is
maintained, but is recommended to be replaced after 5 years.
E. Use:
OC spray may be considered for use to bring under control an individual or
groups of individuals who are engaging in or about to engage in violent behavior.
OC spray should not, however, be used against individuals or group who merely
fail to disperse or do not reasonably appear to present a risk to the safety of
officers or the public.
F. How it Works:
A person subjected to OC can expect heavy tearing due to a burning sensation,
involuntary closing or blinking of the eyes, burning/stinging skin sensation,
redness of the skin, irritation and burning of the nose, runny nose, salivation and
burning sensation of the mouth, cough, gagging sensation, shortness of breath,
temporary paralysis of the larynx (person unable to speak) and nausea (caused by
shock, not the OC itself). A person may also feel disorientated, anxiety, and/or
panic. A complete recovery usually takes place within 45-60 minutes depending
on the level of exposure.
(2) Purpose:
There are a variety of situations where officers may use OC spray such as: self-
defense, overcoming the resistance of a noncompliant individual, effecting an arrest,
preventing escape, violent crowd or riot control, barricade or hostage situations and
dealing with dangerous animals.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The MK-3 OC spray cost approx. $19 per unit and the MK-9 OC spray costs
approx. $60 per unit. The manufacturer is Defense Technology and the Berkeley
Police Department purchase each unit from Galls Police Supply or LC Action
Police Supply. Purchases for these tools are made when inventory gets low which
is typically determined by how many new officers are sworn in, as well as if they
are utilized in dangerous situations.
25 | P ageInternal
B. Cost of Use:
The cost of each usage is unpredictable due to the unknown nature of crime,
timelines of dangerous situations, and number of applications.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of OC spray are not calculable. It could lead to
serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See below cost of training.
E. Training Cost:
Training is conducted in the police academy and in-house by a Police Officer
Standard Training (POST) certified Berkeley Police chemical agent training officer.
The cost of training is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
The majority of the MK-3 OC sprays are either stored within the Police
Department or with each sworn police officer while they conduct official duties.
All MK-9 OC sprays are stored in the basement. There are no additional storage
costs or associated costs to transporting, maintain, or upgrade.
G. Upgrade Costs:
No upgrades exist for this equipment as of this report.
(4) Impact:
The physical effects of being subjected to OC may significantly reduce an individual’s
aggressive behavior. Reports have shown that the use of OC can reduce the amount
of officer and arrestee injuries due to its effectiveness. Chemists assigned to the FBI
Forensic Science Research and Training Center report no long-term health risks
associated with the use of OC. The use of the MK-3 or MK-9 OC spray can render a
dangerous and violent situation safe without using a higher level of force.
(5) Mitigations:
Law Enforcement Officers attend a Police Officer Standard Training (POST) approved
academy before they enter into a Field Training Program and continue their training.
During this academy they are taught about OC, how to deploy it, its effects, and the
decontamination process. They are also subjected to OC to physically feel the effects
themselves. After the academy, each officer is issued a MK-3 OC spray which they
26 | P ageInternal
are to keep on their person while on duty. If deployed and when practical, medical
personnel should be summoned for the affected person(s) per policy 303.
All uses of force require documentation that is completed by the supervisor in a use
of force report and reviewed by the Chain of Command. Furthermore, all
deployments of equipment outlined in the Police Equipment and Community Safety
Ordinance are documented according to the reporting requirements as mandated in
the ordinance.
(6) Alternatives:
Alternatives to utilizing OC sprays are tools such as expandable batons, less lethal
launchers, and/or physical body weapons. The rationale to use OC spray depends on
the circumstances of each individual incident and the individual officer involved in
the incident. As mentioned above, reports have shown that OC spray may
significantly reduce an individual’s aggressive behavior which can minimize the
amount of force necessary to apprehend that subject. Per our Use of Force policy
(Lexipol 300), we shall use the minimal amount of force possible during each
incident, thus making OC spray a valuable option.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
There is no third-party dependence for the First Defense OC spray. Once they are
purchased, they are secured in their designated locations within the Police
Department or with sworn police officers while they conduct official duties.
Chlorobenzylidene Malononitrile and Oleoresin Capsicum
(1) Description:
A. Background:
Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS):
Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) is one of the most commonly used “tear
gases” in the world. It can be liquid, gaseous, or solid substance intended to
produce temporary discomfort through being vaporized or otherwise dispersed
in the air. Law enforcement (LE) agencies have found this agent invaluable when
faced with combative suspects, for crowd/riot control, and for alleviating
barricaded subject situations. LE use it to help control individuals or groups
without the need for a higher level of force. There are four different deployment
methods of chemical agents (Aerosol - most commonly used by police
departments, Fogging, Pyrotechnics, and blast expulsion). All methods of
deployment can be affected by certain environmental and physical conditions
(wind, rain, temperature, distance, and proximity to others). At standard daily
27 | P ageInternal
temperatures and pressures, CS forms a white crystal with a low vapor pressure
and poor solubility in water.
Oleoresin capsicum (OC):
For this portion of the Impact Statement, Oleoresin capsicum (OC) will be
referred to in the aerosol canister form. OC is the chemical agent that is most
widely used amongst Law Enforcement (LE) and the general public. OC has a
pungent and irritating pepper odor. It is classified as an inflammatory agent. OC is
mixed with several types of solutions which act as carriers.
B. Quantity:
Inventory for CS canisters:
Qty 6 – 5230 CS Canisters
Qty 24 – 6230 CS Canisters
Qty 20 – 5230B CS Baffled Canister (flameless)
Qty 17 – 5231 CS Tri-Phaser Canisters
Qty 21 – 4630 CS Muzzle Blast (used with 40 mm less lethal launcher)
Qty 4 – 4530 CS Impact Rounds (used with 40 mm less lethal launcher)
Qty 19 – 4330 CS Barricade Projectile Rounds (used with 40 mm less lethal
launcher)
Inventory for OC canisters:
Qty 54 - 9440 OC Tear Ball
Qty 19 - 5440 OC Flameless
Qty 20 - 6340 OC Vaper
C. Capability:
CS aerosols with microscopic particles which are potent sensory irritants
becoming attached primarily to moist mucous membranes and moist skin.
Common effects are: coughing, increased mucous secretion, difficulty breathing,
skin reactions, and excessive salivation. The onset of symptoms typically occurs
within 20 to 60 seconds, and if the exposed individual is placed in fresh air these
effects generally cease in 10 to 30 minutes.
A person subjected to OC can expect heavy tearing due to a burning sensation,
involuntary closing or blinking of the eyes, stinging skin sensation, redness of the
skin, irritation of the nose, runny nose, salivation, cough, gagging sensation, and
shortness of breath. A person may also experience anxiety and panic. A complete
recovery usually takes place within 45-60 minutes depending on the level of
exposure.
28 | P ageInternal
Both CS and OC canisters can render a dangerous and violent situation safe
without using a higher level of force.
D. Lifespan:
CS and OC canisters expire in approximately 5 years.
E. Use:
Tear gas may be used for crowd control, crowd dispersal or against barricaded
suspects based on the circumstances. Only the Chief of Police may authorize the
delivery and use of tear gas, and only after evaluating all conditions known at the
time and determining that such force reasonably appears justified and necessary.
(2) Purpose:
There are a variety of situations where peace officers may use chemical agents such
as: self-defense, overcoming the resistance of a noncompliant individual, effecting
an arrest, preventing escape, violent crowd or riot control, barricade or hostage
situations and dealing with dangerous animals.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The cost for CS canisters ranges from $20.00 to $39.00 per unit. The cost for OC
canisters ranges from $36.00 to $44.00 per unit. The Berkeley Police Department
prefers the use of the Combined Tactical Systems (CTS) chemical agents and we
purchase them from LC Action Police Supply.
B. Cost of Use:
The cost of each proposed use is unpredictable due to the demand, unknown
nature and timelines of dangerous crowd/riots situations, dangerous barricade
situations, and hostage situations.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of OC and CS are not calculable. It could lead to
serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See below cost of training.
E. Training Cost:
When purchased, each unit is given an expiration date which typically falls within
a 2-3-year range. Every 2-3 years, new chemical agents are purchased to honor
29 | P ageInternal
the expiration dates. The expired agents are then used during annual trainings
thus minimizing the overall cost. Training is conducted by a Police Officer
Standard Training (POST) certified Berkeley Police chemical agent training officer.
The cost of training is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
The majority of agents are stored inside of a marked chemical agent room within
the Police Department, in the Special Response Team vehicle, or in the rescue
Vehicle. There are no additional storage costs. There are no associated costs to
transporting, maintenance, or upgrades.
G. Upgrade Costs:
No upgrades exist for this equipment as of this report.
(4) Impact:
BPD is committed to preserving and protecting human life and welfare. These tools
allow us to fulfill our commitment to our community.
Law Enforcement, under Penal Code 12403.1, is able to lawfully purchase, possess,
or use chemical agents in the discharge of their duties. CS and/or OC canisters have
been prominently used to resolve dangerous barricaded suspect situations and
violent crowd control/riot situations.
Berkeley Police officers are trained to utilize time and distance to de-escalate
dangerous barricaded situations in order to resolve each incident with minimal the
use of force (per Use of Force Policy 300). In some circumstances when all other
options are exhausted, CS and/or OC can be inserted into the structure in which the
barricaded suspect is, denying access to certain areas inside. Unless exigent
circumstances arise, all attempts to evacuate the structure are made prior to any
deployment. When CS and/or OC are deployed into a structure the suspect may be
forced outside allowing the situation to resolve safely with no use further use of
force.
CS and/or OC chemical agents can be utilized to create order in dangerous crowd
control/riot situations that have demonstrated violence or destruction. During these
incidents, typically a clear and direct warning has been given to the crowd to
disperse before the chemical agents are deployed. The ability to disperse crowds
from a distance limits injury to Police Officers as well as damage to critical structures.
30 | P ageInternal
(5) Mitigations:
Regarding the already mentioned impacts, the decision to utilize chemical agents
(unless there are exigent circumstances) flows through the chain of command and
ultimately makes its way to the Chief of Police and the City Manager. If there are
exigent circumstances, the Field Commander makes the decision and then advises
the Chief of Police as soon as practical. All uses of force require documentation that
is completed by the supervisor in a use of force report and reviewed by the Chain of
Command. Furthermore, all deployments of equipment outlined in the Police
Equipment and Community Safety Ordinance are documented according to the
reporting requirements as mandated in the ordinance.
With these procedures incorporated in BPD’s policies, this mitigates many potential
negative impacts. Per Policy 428 – First Amendment Assemblies - The Field
Commander shall determine the type and quantity of chemical agents to be
used. After use of chemical agents, the Field Commander shall re-evaluate the scene
to determine if additional chemical agents are needed. Less-than-lethal munitions
(40 mm CS impact rounds), chemical agents (including OC spray), and/or smoke shall
only be deployed in crowd control situations as outlined in the Use of Force
Policy. For planned events, inventories shall be conducted before and at the
conclusion of the incident. Outside agency inventories shall also be tracked.
In addition to the mitigations in place, the Berkeley Police Special Response Team
also receives annual training on the use of chemical agents, the effects, and the
decontamination process. Per policy 303, when practical, medical personnel should
be summoned for the affected person(s).
(6) Alternatives:
There are no direct alternatives for CS and OC. They are the industry’s leading way to
resolve barricaded suspects while reducing the likelihood of injury to the subject,
community, and officers. Additionally, it is one of the only tools that allows officers
to stop acts of violence or regain order during crowd control/riot situations. They are
very distinct in nature and have direct purposes. The rationale to use CS or OC
depends on the circumstances of each incident. The Berkeley Police Department
shall use the minimal amount of force per our Use of Force Policy 300. The use of CS
or OC allows the police personnel to maintain distance, giving officers more time to
react and avoid a potential need for a higher level of force to safely resolve the
situation.
31 | P ageInternal
(7) Third Party Dependence:
There is no third-party dependence for CS and OC chemical agents. Once they are
purchased, they are secured in their designated areas and stay there until they are
either used during incidents or training.
Remington 700 Rifle
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The Remington 700 is a series of bolt-action rifles designed in 1962 by the
Remington Arms Company. The “700” designator is the generic name for multiple
models of rifles with various parts, barrel lengths, stocks, etc. The Remington 700
rifle has long been used by law enforcement agencies and continues to be an
industry standard for issued equipment. The Berkeley Police Department utilizes
a custom Remington 700 action, chambered in the common .308-caliber round,
with a 20” barrel and an Accuracy International chassis/stock. The rifle also
includes a Nightforce 3-15x magnified optic and bipod.
BPD utilizes Hornady .308-caliber ammunition. This particular ammunition is
specially designed for law enforcement applications due to its increased and
consistent accuracy and performance.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department Special Response Team (SRT) currently
possesses six Remington 700 rifles, all configured in the same manner.
Currently, BPD has approximately 1,800 Hornady .308-caliber rounds. That
quantity of ammunition fluctuates depending on supply from distributors and
training schedules of those trained officers.
C. Capability:
The Remington 700 rifle, with the appropriate ammunition, training, and
practice, is capable of consistent and highly accurate shooting out to a distance of
approximately 500-yards.
The Remington 700 is intended to be used in emergency situations where there is
a high potential for violence, where the need exists to put distance between
officers and a specific individual, such as an armed hostage situation.
32 | P ageInternal
D. Lifespan:
The Remington 700 bolt-action rifles have an expected life span of 10-years if
properly maintained.
E. Use:
Used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims of violent
crimes, general public, and officers.
F. How it Works:
The Remington 700 is a manually operated rifle. It requires the officer to
physically maneuver a handle to expel a spent cartridge and to load another
unspent round of ammunition in order to fire a second round. When the trigger is
pressed, a firing pin strikes the primer of a bullet loaded into the chamber of the
rifle. The ignited primer ignites gun powder contained in the bullet which pushes
the bullet down the barrel and out the muzzle. The officer must then pull a
handle attached to the bolt to the rear, ejecting the spent cartridge. The officer
then pushes the bolt forward, which picks up another bullet from the magazine,
and closes the chamber, making the rifle ready to fire again.
(2) Purpose:
This rifle is to be used in the defense of life or great bodily injury to potential victims
of violent crimes, general public, and officers. This rifle provides police with the
benefit of adding distance to a volatile situation which can increase the safety for
community members and officers. This rifle is an ancillary firearm for situations
where increased distance and accuracy is needed to safely resolve the situation.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The initial cost to purchase this rifle with its associated components is
approximately $10,000 dollars each. Their average life span is 10-years at which
time it will likely need to be replaced.
B. Cost of Use:
Cost of use for all firearms should be based on the ammunition used in training
and on duty. This will fluctuate based on training.
C. Cost of Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects and improper usage of a firearm are not calculable. It could lead
to the loss of life or serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in
civil liabilities.
33 | P ageInternal
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
If this rifle is not cared for or maintained well, then a potential financial adverse
impact would be the premature purchasing of a replacement rifle or replacement
parts. However, authorized and trained Berkeley Police armorers service and
provide regular maintenance of the rifles. The cost of maintenance is staff time.
E. Training Costs:
The cost associated with training is the staff time, range fees, and cost of spent
ammunition. SRT members train once a month and, on average, each member
shoots approximately 50-rounds. Currently, there are only 4 members shooting
at each training day. This equates to approximately 2,400 rounds of ammunition
being fired per year. This does not include special training days or attendance to
training schools/classes. A single box of 20-rounds costs approximately $20-
dollars or $1 dollar per round.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use over time. Firing pins need to be
replaced every 5 to 7 years. The maintenance cost associated with this rifle is
minimal.
There are no costs associated with maintenance or storage of ammunition. All
ammunition is stored in a climate-controlled room in the Berkeley Police
Department.
G. Upgrade Costs:
Upgrade costs and maintenance cost are synonymous due to the consistent
design. Improvements in technology and new designs may be an additional cost
but we can’t predict what those will be at this time.
Should advancements be made in ammunition manufacturing; those upgrade
costs are unknown at this time.
(4) Impact:
The primary purpose of this rifle is to further SRT’s goal of adding time and distance
when dealing with a violent and dangerous individual(s). The rifle may allow SRT
additional time by increasing the distance between law enforcement and the specific
individual, thereby increasing the likelihood of a more peaceful resolution. Like all
tools, it has a time and place for its intended operational efficacy.
34 | P ageInternal
(5) Mitigations:
Mitigating impacts from this tool’s primary purpose is done through regular training.
The training includes accuracy, decision making, scenarios, and various other training
points. All uses of force require documentation that is completed by the supervisor
in a use of force report and reviewed by the Chain of Command. Furthermore, all
deployments of equipment outlined in the Police Equipment and Community Safety
Ordinance are documented according to the reporting requirements as mandated in
the ordinance.
(6) Alternatives:
The Remington 700 rifle is an industry standard tool used to deliver precision
accuracy on an intended target. This tool can deliver accuracy and predictability
through intermediate barriers like glass windows. It can be used at distances greater
than any other tool currently possessed or authorized. No alternate tool or method
would accomplish the same goal.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
These rifles are fairly simple in their design and operation. They do require regular
maintenance which is commonly performed by each individual member. BPD
Armorers are also capable of performing additional maintenance. If an issue arises
which is beyond the scope of our Armorers we would seek professional assistance
from the manufacturer. However, the need for this is very rare.
ReconRobotics Recon Scout XT
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The Recon Scout XT is a throwable micro-robot manufactured by ReconRobotics for use
in law enforcement applications. The Recon Scout XT enables officers to obtain
instantaneous video footage and audio within indoor or outdoor environments.
Designed to withstand repeated drops onto concrete, the Recon Scout XT robot can be
thrown into hazardous situations (hostage rescue, barricaded subjects, natural disasters,
etc.) in order to allow officers to quickly and safely make informed decisions when
seconds count.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department has two Recon Scout XT throwable robots, both
purchased in 2010.
35 | P ageInternal
C. Capability:
The Recon Scout XT robot is designed to be able to crawl over a variety of terrain,
clearing obstacles up to 2″ (5 cm) tall. It could be thrown into hazardous situations,
indoor and outdoor, and provide live audio and video feed back to the controller.
D. Lifespan:
Both Recon Scout XT robots are over 10 years old and ReconRobotics have developed
and manufactured more advanced robots. ReconRobotics have stopped manufacturing
certain parts for the Recon Scout XT, so the lifespan is dependent on what parts need to
be replaced.
E. Use:
The Recon Scout XT robot may be deployed to help police officers safely view potentially
dangerous environments before entering them.
F. How it Works:
The Recon Scout XT robot has a cylindrical body with a finned-wheel at either end of its
body, and is stabilized by a rubber “tail”. It measures approximately 6 ½” wide, and
each wheel is about 5” in diameter (fin to fin) and weights just over one pound (1.2 lbs.).
The Recon Scout XT robot sends digital video and audio back to an Operator Control
Unit (OCU; controller with a screen and joystick), which allows the officer to control the
robot, which provides a live feedback containing audio and visual feeds. The Recon
Scout XT robot does not record audio or video footage; there is no data storage
capability.
(2) Purpose:
The Recon Scout XT robot is intended to safely provide police officers valuable information
during high-risk, rapid evolving situations via real-time audio and video footage. It can be
driven a distance away from the OCU, creating space between the officer and potential
danger, thus decreasing the likelihood of injury to those involved in the event, or even a
violent encounter between police officers and a dangerous subject. This asset furthers our
commitment to the sanctity of life by offering time and distance in critical incidents.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial cost:
The initial cost for the Recon Scout XT robot was about $12,500 per unit (2010 cost).
B. Cost of Use:
There is no “per use” cost of this equipment. The Recon Scout XT is powered by a
rechargeable battery.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Impacts:
36 | P ageInternal
The likelihood of adverse impacts due to the use of the Recon Scout XT robot is low – it is
small, lightweight and is not likely to injure persons or damage personal property when
deployed; however, there is a small chance that the Recon Scout XT robot might cause
damage to personal property when deployed (thrown) into a structure. Due caution is
used when it becomes necessary to throw, rather than place, the robot into a structure.
D. Annual and Ongoing Cost:
There are no ongoing or annual costs associated with the use of the Recon Scout XT
robot. Being that it is battery operated, there is a nominal cost associated with charging
the Recon Scout XT robot’s batteries, and the batteries of the OCU. The Recon Scout XT
robot is fairly simple to operate, thus there is no cost associated with training officers in
its use. There are no costs with transportation or storage of the Recon Scout XT robot.
While there are newer models of this robot available, there does not appear to be any
upgrades available for the Recon Scout XT. The Recon Scout XT robot has been damaged
on occasion, and there are costs associated with repair. But generally, the Recon Scout
XT robot is robust and does not need regular repair.
E. Training Cost:
The Recon Scout XT robot is user friendly and simple to operate. Training is conducted by
Berkeley Police personnel familiar with the operations and procedures of the Recon
Scout XT robot. The cost of training is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
There are no annual or storage costs.
G. Upgrade Costs:
There are no upgrades available at the time of this report.
(4) Impact:
The Recon Scout XT robot is used to safely gather information in situations where it may be
dangerous to expose an officer, or officers, to gather the same information. Putting officers
in such unknown, tense situations has the potential to create violent encounters, or
otherwise place officers in unnecessary peril and danger that might otherwise be avoided
by the use of a tool like the Recon Scout XT robot. The Recon Scout XT robot is not likely to
have a negative impact on the welfare or safety of the public as its role is to gather real-
time information during high-risk incidents such as hostage or potentially life-threatening
situations. The Recon Scout XT robot is likely to improve the welfare and increase the safety
of the public through its ability to gather real-time information and feed it back to police
officers. The Recon Scout XT robot does not have the capability to record or store data.
(5) Mitigations:
The use of the Recon Scout XT robot is limited to sworn police officers, and guided by field
supervisors (Lieutenants and Sergeants). Procedurally, the Recon Scout XT robot is used
when exigent circumstances exist (hostage situation, barricaded subject, natural disaster
37 | P ageInternal
necessitating rescue, etc.) and real-time information is necessary to safely and effectively
resolve the situation. The robot does not record or store data.
(6) Alternatives:
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are an alternative to robots such as the Recon Scout XT
robot. However, the Berkeley City Council has prohibited the Berkeley Police Department
from using UAVs. They are not constrained by obstacles on the ground and provide far
superior perspective and situational awareness; at times, obstacles halt the Recon Scout XT
robot’s movement. There are several other robots on the market, however, the Recon
Scout XT robot is compact, lightweight (weighing in at just over a pound), very
maneuverable, and can easily be carried by an officer. It can also be introduced into
structures by throwing it through any opening – an option not possible with other robot
models.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
The Recon Scout XT robot does not currently rely on a third-party company or vendor for its
use or maintenance. Should maintenance or parts be required beyond the scope of the
members of the Berkeley Police Department, the robot would be sent to ReconRobotics for
service.
Andros Remotec HD-1 Hazardous Duty Robot
(1) Description:
A. Background:

exists and is too hazardous for a bomb technician to approach in person. The Remotec
HD-1 robot is also used to survey an area prior to a bomb technician approaching a
38 | P ageInternal
scene to check for trip wires and ascertain a good approach path. The Remotec HD-1
robot has three cameras and audio monitoring that stream live video and audio back to
the control module; however, it is unable to record and does not have any data storage
capabilities. It has several attachment mounting options as well. The Remotec HD-1
robot also has the ability to carry a variety of tools. Some of the tools are:
1) A spike to break glass and access vehicles or homes with potential explosive
devices inside
2) An X-ray mount in order to remotely X-ray suspected explosive devices.
3) Percussion actuated non-electric disruptors which are smooth barrels that are
filled with water and fired at high speed with a blank shotgun round to open
backpacks, suitcases, and packages from a distance
4) A hook with cutting blades that are used to cut backpack straps, ropes, etc.
5) PAN rounds containing various fills, from sand to slugs, in order to open sturdier
packages made from metal or other hard covers.
6) Electrical connections to connect explosives that can be detonated remotely and
from a safe distance.
D. Lifespan:
The Remotec HD-1 robot has an expected life span of 10 years. It is currently 13 years
old and has begun exhibiting issues. The Remotec HD-1 robot weighs just over 200 lbs.
and has been near multiple explosions over the years and crossed a variety of off-road
terrain
E. Use:
Used to examine and possible destroy hazardous materials such as an explosive device.
F. How it Works:
The Remotec HD-1 robot is piloted by a bomb technician into a hazardous area to
locate, examine, and render suspicious packages and explosive devices safe by utilizing a
variety of attachable tools.
(2) Purpose:
The Remotec HD-1 robot is used as a means to approach hazardous situations where a
potentially lethal threat such as an explosive device exist. The Remotec HD-1 robot allows
for the examination and manipulation of an object or potential explosive device without
unnecessarily putting a bomb technician’s life at risk.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Procured in 2008 for $214,496 including on-site training through a UASI Grant. (64,292-
N.S.)
39 | P ageInternal
B. Cost of Use:
None. The robot is electric and operated through the City’s electricity for charging.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
The Remotec HD-1 robot interacts with inanimate objects. However, should it
encounter a package that explodes, it could potentially destroy the robot and
damage other property.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
There is no annual cost. Maintenance of the Remotec HD-1 robot is conducted by
Berkeley Police Bomb Technicians.
E. Training Costs:
Berkeley Police Bomb Technicians are trained during regular bomb squad training
sessions and maintain their skills through training scenarios. The cost of training is
limited to staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Remotec offers occasional maintenance and upkeep workshops free of charge.
G. Upgrade Costs:
There are no costs for upgrades as the company has stopped manufacturing the robot
and any applicable upgrades.
(4) Impact:
The Remotec HD-1 robot is used by the Berkeley Police Department Bomb Squad as a
means to examine a potentially explosive device in order to keep the community safe. Since
April 2020, the Berkeley Police Department Bomb Squad has responded to 14 incidents. The
impact of the Remotec HD-1 robot has been to reduce and minimize the danger posed by
calls of possible explosive devices to the Berkeley Police Department’s Bomb Technicians.
(5) Mitigations:
The Remotec HD-1 robot is used in situations where a hazardous device exists. In these
situations, the area is always evacuated in order to ensure community safety.
(6) Alternatives:
The Remotec HD-1 robot is 13 years old and there has been significant development in
technology. There are several alternatives that are far superior than our current Remotec
HD-1; Mark V-A1 robot developed by Remotec Andros, Caliber Flex developed by ICOR
Technology, Digital Vanguard-S developed by Med-Eng and T7 and T4 developed by L3Harris
Technologies. These are alternatives that have newer and better technology and capabilities
than the Remotec HD-1 robot.
40 | P ageInternal
(7) Third Party Dependence:
Remotec representatives are the only ones used to diagnose and maintain complex issues
on the robot that cannot be done in-house. Since it is proprietary technology, Remotec may
void warranties on any repairs made by outside vendors or by untrained personnel.
Therefore, all complex issues with the Remotec HD-1 robot must be repaired by Remotec.
Light/Sound Diversionary Device
(1) Description:
A. Background:
Light/Sound Diversionary devices also known as distraction device, flashbang,
light/sound and noise/flash devices have been available for approximately 40
years and are a safe and effective tool for Law Enforcement (LE) to use during
challenging tactical incidents. The device will be referred to a diversionary device
throughout this document.
B. Quantity:
Qty 50 - CTS 7290 Diversionary Device
C. Capability:
When a diversionary device is deployed they create a loud noise, heat and
brilliant light and create an effective diversion. They can create psychological and
physiological effects such as: hearing a loud noise beyond that of everyday living,
seeing a short bright light, and feeling of a change in atmospheric pressure. These
effects may disorient/confuse subjects for a short time giving tactical teams the
ability to apprehend that subject without using a higher level of force.
D. Lifespan:
The lifespan of the CTS 7290 Diversionary Device is 5 years.
E. Use:
The use of a diversionary device is to create a diversion in order to facilitate entry
and enable arrest. Circumstances justifying the use of a diversionary device may
include, but not limited to barricaded subject or hostage situations and high-risk
search warrants services.
F. How it Works:
The main charge of a modern diversionary device typically contains flash powder
which is sometimes called photoflash powder. Upon initiation, this chemical
compound causes the device to deflagrate (not detonate). The powder mixture is
41 | P ageInternal
rapidly changed into gases that expand outward reaching upwards to 3,800 times
the original volume of the charge itself. This process releases the desired effects
of loud noise, bright light and the feeling of atmospheric pressure. Flash powder
is typically made up of an oxidizer and some type of fuel. The oxidizer is needed
to initiate and sustain the flash powder’s rapid combustion. This is required since
sufficient oxygen cannot be obtained from just the surrounding air.
(2) Purpose:
The purpose of a diversionary device is to create a reactionary gap of a person by
temporarily disorienting them. This gap gives tactical teams an opportunity to
apprehend a suspect while using the minimal amount of force possible. They can
also be used to safely invoke a response or redirect the attention of subjects who are
either feigning injury, ignoring police commands or are unresponsive while posing a
threat to the public.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
Diversionary Devices cost approximately $45 per unit and are purchased through
LC Action Police Supply. Purchases for these tools are made when inventory
becomes low, based upon critical incident usage and Special Response Team
trainings that incorporate live devices.
B. Cost of Use:
The cost of each proposed use is unpredictable due to the unknown nature and
timelines of dangerous barricade situations, critical incident, and hostage
situations. The devices may be stored inside of the Police Department, in the
Special Response Team Vehicle, or in the rescue vehicle. There are no additional
storage costs. There are no associated costs for transporting, maintenance,
training, or upgrades.
C. Cost of Potential Advert Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of a diversionary device are not calculable. It
could result in serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in civil
liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
See below training cost.
42 | P ageInternal
E. Training Cost:
Only trained and qualified personnel are permitted to deploy diversionary
devices. These trained Berkeley Police officers are typically members of the
Berkeley Police Department Special Response Team who receive monthly training
which includes training in the deployment of diversionary devices. The cost of
training is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
The majority of diversionary devices are stored inside of a room in the basement
within the Police Department. There are no additional storage costs. There are no
associated costs to transporting, maintenance, or upgrades.
G. Upgrade Costs:
No upgrades exist for this equipment as of this report.
(4) Impact:
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to preserving and protecting human
life and welfare. These tools allow us to fulfill our commitment to our community.
Diversionary Devices may be utilized in many situations to include potentially
dangerous barricaded subject situations, hostage situations, and critical incidents.
Some criteria considered prior to a deployment is dependent upon whether the
suspect is a dangerous felon, causes a life-threatening situation and/or other unique
incidents where it appears to be a reasonable method in which to resolve the
situation. When deployed appropriately these devices can assist in safely
apprehending suspects and resolving high risk critical incidents with minimal or no
injuries to suspects and/or officers.
(5) Mitigations:
Since Diversionary Devices are considered low explosives, there are several protocols
in place to mitigate possible negative results (i.e. minor or major injuries).
Only trained and qualified personnel are permitted to deploy diversionary devices;
typically, members of the Special Response Team who receive constant training
regarding the deployment, effects, and post deployment protocols.
Pre-deployment concerns are typically gathered and evaluated, such as:
• The number of people at a location and the individual location of suspects
within the structure.
43 | P ageInternal
• Evaluation if there are children or elderly people present
• An evaluation of the suspect’s mental and physical conditioning
• Evaluation of the building/room layout
• Possible combustible/flammable substances present
• Lighting conditions
When a diversionary device is deployed, the officer shall utilize a helmet, hearing
protection, eye protection, body armor, and nomex (fire resistive) gloves.
If a diversionary device is used, a supervisor shall be notified, medical
treatment/screening is conducted, and a collection of the deflagrated device is
completed. Documentation utilizing the device serial number is recorded.
Per Policy 351 - Except in extreme emergencies (i.e., life-threatening situations),
flash/sound diversionary devices shall not be used without prior authorization of the
incident commander/on-scene supervisor. Whenever diversionary devices are
carried by personnel in an actual situation or incident, that fact shall be noted in the
after-action report or police report. In the event devices are deployed, the
circumstances surrounding their deployment shall be fully described. The Chief of
Police or his or her designee shall be responsible for reviewing any deployment of
diversionary devices to ensure that policy was followed. Diversionary devices are
registered by serial number with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).
Typically, the police department’s purchase of new devices is reported directly (by
case-lot serial numbers) to ATF by the device manufacturer via ATF Form 5. The
National Firearms Act requires the police department to notify ATF upon the
use/expenditure of diversionary devices. A Special Response Team member shall be
responsible for submitting written notification to ATF when all devices listed on a
single ATF form 5 have been used/expended.
(6) Alternatives:
A possible alternative to a diversionary device (flashbang) is the Tactical Electronic
Distraction Device (T.E.D.D.) which emits 2600 lumen light and high pitched 120
decibel sound to disorientate subjects. This could be a good tool as it is not a low
explosive however it has its negative aspects as well:
44 | P ageInternal
• There is no feeling of atmospheric pressure, limiting the desired
momentary physiological effect.
• A suspect could pick up and throw the device at potential victims and at
police officers. The currently used diversionary devices are too hot to
attempt this.
• In certain circumstances, a suspect could potentially steal the device
during an escape.
• The individual cost per unit is approx. $200 which is much more than a
diversionary device
• This device is significantly less effective in disorienting subjects compared
to a diversionary device.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
There is no third-party dependence for Diversionary Devices with the exception of
communication with ATF of the purchase. Once they are purchased, they are
secured within their designated locations where they are stored until they are either
used during incidents or training.
Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD)
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The Long-Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is a high intensity directional acoustical
array for long range, crystal clear notification system. The use of the LRAD is for
communications.
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department possesses 2 Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD)
speakers. One is an LRAD 450XL and the other is an LRAD 100X.
C. Capability:
Both of these speakers are able to focus sound in directional pattern allowing the
user to make sound audible over distances much greater than conventional
public address speakers. The LRAD 450XL is the larger of the two and designed to
either be used in a fixed location or mounted on a vehicle to make it portable. It
45 | P ageInternal
has a usable range of approximately 1 mile. The LRAD 100X is smaller and more
portable. It can be carried or mounted to a person’s chest for mobility or
mounted to a vehicle. Its range is approximately 1/3 of a mile. Both of these
systems allow for clear long-range communication, they are also able to play
recorded messages.
D. Lifespan:
The lifespan for both LRADs is 25 years.
E. Use:
The LRADs are used to communicate with the community during natural
disasters, crowd management and control situations, or when other forms of
communications are ineffective or inoperable to unequivocally communicate
messages from Police or Fire and safely resolve uncertain situations where
communicating with the public is paramount.
F. How it Works:
The LRADs are essentially a long-range speaker or long-range megaphone and
operates as such.
(2) Purpose:
The LRADs are designed for clear long-range communication. The LRAD’s ability to
communicate over a long distance is far superior to any megaphone or Public
Address (PA) system mounted to a police vehicle. Additionally, LRAD’s may be used
to:
• Communicate lifesaving information to residents during disasters
• Communicate to large crowds during parades, festivals, concerts and
sporting events
• Establish safety zones and perimeters
• Control traffic congestion
• Conduct Special Response Team operations
• Broadcast a dispersal order
• Communicate during hostage and barricaded subject situations
• Announce and serve high risk warrants
• Communicate to protesters
• Communicate to persons threatening suicide who are in an inaccessible
location
• Conduct search and rescue operations
46 | P ageInternal
The ability to communicate with the public in a large area increases the safety of all
members of the public and law enforcement. It allows everyone in a given area to
know what is being communicated, gives more situational awareness to everyone in
a given area and allows people to know where to go or not to go.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The LRAD 450XL and the LRAD 100X were purchased in 2018. The total cost for
both LRADs, rechargeable battery packs and accessories was $49,999.
B. Cost of Use:
There is no cost associated with each use of the LRADs. The systems run on
batteries or can plug into a vehicle.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of the LRADs are not calculable. It could lead to
hearing loss. Additionally, the improper use could result in civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
BPD has not incurred any additional cost to date for this equipment.
E. Training Costs:
Training is conducted by Berkeley Police personnel who are trained in the use
and procedures of the LRAD. The cost to train is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
There are no maintenance or storage costs for this equipment.
G. Upgrade Costs:
No upgrades exist for this equipment as of this report.
(4) Impact:
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to ensuring the safety of our
community. Having the ability to communicate efficiently and effectively in different
situations is crucial in providing potentially life-saving information to the public. The
LRAD provides BPD personnel the ability to communicate long distances to people
that are in a given area, inside structures, or barricaded inside a structure. The LRAD
is very effective any situation involving communicating information to large crowds,
or entire communities.
47 | P ageInternal
(5) Mitigations:
The only potential negative impact of the LRAD’s is that they are capable of
producing a high pitched “deterrent tone” that is designed to disperse a potential
threat. This “deterrent tone” does have the ability to cause hearing damage. BPD
Policy 707 strictly prohibits any member of BPD from using the LRAD as a weapon.
Additionally, the LRAD can only be deployed at the direction of a Watch Commander
or Incident Commander and may only be used by personnel specifically trained in

36” Baton
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The Berkeley Police Department issues a knurled grip, polycarbonate, fixed-length
straight baton for crowd control purposes. The baton is 36” long and 1.25” in
diameter and weighs about 1.64 pounds. Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic, which
means it is durable, resistant to splintering and heat.
B. Quantity:
In 2017, BPD purchased 175 polycarbonate 36” batons to replace aging wood
batons of the same purpose. Additional polycarbonate batons were purchased
over the past four years to ensure all sworn police officers as well as trained
reserve police officers are equipped with the 36” baton. BPD possesses
approximately 195 - 36” polycarbonate batons. Most of these batons are issued to
and maintained by individuals. However, a small amount of these batons is stored
in a secure equipment room as spares in case of damage or new personnel issue.
48 | P ageInternal
C. Capabilities:
The 36” baton is carried in a “baton ring” on an officer’s belt just as any other
baton. It is used as a safety tool and is a means for officers to defend themselves
in certain crowd control or riot situations. Trained officers may employ particular
applications of force with their 36” batons when directed by their chain of
command. The 36” baton is the desirable baton in a crowd control situation as it is
7” longer than the standard 29” baton. The longer baton creates more distance
between the officer and others, which is critical when dealing with violent or
aggressive crowds.
D. Lifespan:
The manufacturer provides a lifetime repair or replacement guarantee.
E. Use:
The 36” baton is a less-lethal force tool and is intended to be used in crowd
control situations in close quarters, where officers may defend an attack, or when
engaging in physical contact with combative or aggressive crowd members. The
36” baton is only used for crowd situations.
F. How it Works:
There are a number of appropriate blocking or striking techniques an officer may
use when force is justified and the decision is made to use the 36” baton to
effectively gain control of a person or situation. The use of the baton requires the
officer to continually monitor and assess effectiveness of any delivered strikes.
The reason this type of force is administered is to stop a person’s attack, threat or
resistance, with the goal to place them under lawful arrest for their actions.
(2) Purpose:
The 36” baton is a less-lethal tool that may be used when a crowd becomes
aggressive, hostile or violent. It is the most effective individual tool of choice when
officers are in formation and engaged in crowd control duties.
When officers are deployed to maintain, disperse, or protect others from a violent
crowd or civil disobedience, it is imperative that they have an adequate safety zone
to protect themselves or others. The 36” baton provides officers additional distance
from a potential threat than the standard issue 29” baton.
When the baton is used to strike a subject, kinetic energy transfer occurs. Kinetic
energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy which an
object has depends upon two variables: the mass of the object and the speed of the
49 | P ageInternal
object. The desired effect is for the officer to apply a baton strike with the necessary
energy to stop the threat as quickly and safely as possible. By targeting the large
muscle areas of the arms or legs with sufficient kinetic energy, motor and sensory
nerves can be affected. When the nerves are affected this will create momentary
muscle dysfunction or pain, which will allow the officer the ability to gain control of
the subject, while minimizing the possibility of long-term injury to the subject.
The head, neck, throat, spine, heart, kidneys and groin should not be intentionally
targeted except when the person’s conduct is creating an immediate threat of
serious bodily injury or death to an officer or any other person as outlined in policy
303 and 300.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The cost of the Monadnock MP36 2004 36” polycarbonate baton with knurled
grip was $53.00 per baton in September 2017. After tax, $10,132.94 was spent
for the purchase of 175 batons. The department placed an additional order for 20
batons in December 2019. It is anticipated that the cost of the baton will
fluctuate a few dollars based on supply and demand over time.
B. Cost of Use:
The only cost associated with use that of ongoing departmental training to
ensure officers are proficient in authorized baton techniques.
C. Costs of Potential Adverse Impacts:
Adverse effects from improper use of the 36” baton cannot be anticipated.
Improper use could lead to serious bodily injury or death. Additionally, the
improper use could result in civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
There is no additional annual or ongoing cost associated with the 36” baton.
E. Training costs:
Training on the applications of the batons are conducted at the police academy.
Police Office Standard Training (POST) requires “arrest and control” training
every 2 years which includes portions of baton training. This training is conducted
in-house by POST certified defensive tactics instructors.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
There are no associated costs to transporting, maintenance, or upgrades.
50 | P ageInternal
G. Upgrade Costs:
No upgrades exist for this equipment as of this report.
(4) Impact:
Per Policy 300, “The Berkeley Police Department’s highest priority is safeguarding
the life, dignity, and liberty of all persons. The Department is committed to
accomplishing this mission with respect and minimal reliance of the use of force by
using rapport-building communication, crisis intervention, and de-escalation tactics
before resorting to force.”
At times, it may become necessary for police officers to use force in crowd control
situations to move a crowd, stop violent behavior, overcome resistance or make a
lawful arrest. Officers have been trained that they must do everything possible to
avoid unnecessary uses of force, and minimize the force that is used, while still
protecting themselves and the public. When deemed necessary, use of the 36” baton
may be used as a tool to strike a person, create a barrier or used in formation in
order to move a crowd in a certain direction. The use of the baton may cause
discomfort, pain, blunt trauma and has the potential to cause serious injury. Their
use is subject to the totality of the circumstances, proper training, department
policy, as well as federal and state law.
Officers who use the 36” baton are trained to continuously assess each situation
where force is used and only use the force that is reasonably necessary and
proportional to respond to the threat or resistance to effectively and safety resolve
the incident.
(5) Mitigations:
Per Policy 300, “In all cases where physical force is used, officers shall use a
minimum amount of force that is objectively reasonable, objectively necessary, and
proportional to effectively and safely resolve a conflict.”
Per Policy 303, “Only officers who have successfully completed department-
approved training in the use of any control device are authorized to carry and use
the device. Control devices may be used when a decision has been made to control,
restrain or arrest a subject who is violent or who demonstrates the intent to be
violent, and the use of the device appears reasonable under the circumstances.
When reasonable, a verbal warning and opportunity to comply should precede the
use of these devices. When using control devices, officers should carefully consider
potential impact areas in order to minimize injuries and unintentional targets.”
51 | P ageInternal
Every officer who carries a 36” baton has been trained how to properly carry the
equipment, it’s intended use, target areas and non-target areas. Large muscle groups
such as the upper legs or lower abdomen are approved target areas and areas to be
avoided at the groin and head. When a baton strike is directed at an intended target
area and the subject moves simultaneously, it is possible for the officer to
unintentionally strike a non-target area. Officers are trained to consider the
placement of baton strikes, and to immediately render medical aid to the subject as
soon as it is safe to do so.
All uses of force require documentation that is completed by the supervisor in a use
of force report and reviewed by the Chain of Command. Furthermore, all
deployments of equipment outlined in the Police Equipment and Community Safety
Ordinance are documented according to the reporting requirements as mandated in
the ordinance.
(6) Alternatives:
The alternatives to the 36” crowd control baton are the 29” standard issue baton
and collapsible 26” Rapid Containment Baton (RCB). The standard issue baton and
RCB are shorter in length and require officers to be closer to the person they are
engaging, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the officer and the person. A longer
baton provides an officer with more distance which creates a small safety zone and
allows the officer time to react and access the situation before making use of force
decisions.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
There is no requirement for a third-party service provider to issue the 36” crowd
control baton. Berkeley Police Department Defensive Tactics Instructors provide in-
house training on the proper use of the baton.
Mobile Command Vehicle
(1) Description:
A. Background
The Berkeley Police Department owns one Mobile Command Vehicle (MCV). Our
MCV is a 2003 Freightliner MT55. This vehicle’s most common use is as a commercial
delivery vehicle. Our 2003 Freightliner MT55 was converted into a MCV by adding
desktop work stations, additional police radios and emergency lighting. The MCV is
30’ long and has a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of approximately 23,000 pounds.
52 | P ageInternal
B. Quantity:
The Berkeley Police Department owns 1 MCV.
C. Capability:
The MCV is a mobile office that provides shelter and may be used as a mobile
command and communication center.
D. Lifespan:
This vehicle is approximately 20 years old and is at the tail end of its serviceable
lifespan. All emergency vehicles need to be completely dependable and vehicles
of this age start to lose dependability as old parts start to fail without warning.
The modern versions of this type of vehicle are typically converted motorhomes.
E. Use:
This vehicle is used as a mobile command post for large scaled events.
F. How it Works:
This vehicle operates and drives like other vehicles.
(2) Purpose:
This vehicle may be used as a mobile command post for any larger scaled events or
as a communications center in the event the communications center in the Public
Safety Building is inoperable. Some examples of large-scale events include Solano
Stroll, Juneteenth, 4th of July, critical incidents or natural disasters.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial cost:
The initial cost of the MCV (2003 Freightliner MT55) was $230,800.
B. Cost of Use:
The cost of use is the cost of fuel from the City Corporation Yard.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of the MCV are not calculable, but is the same as
improper use of any vehicles. The improper use could result in civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
There is no annual or ongoing cost associated with this vehicle. Maintenance of
the vehicle is conducted by the City’s Corporation Yard.
53 | P ageInternal
E. Training Costs:
Training is conducted in-house by Berkeley Police personnel who are trained in
the operation of the vehicle. The training cost is staff time.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
There are no storage costs and maintenance would be conducted by the City of
Berkeley Corporation Yard.
G. Upgrade Cost:
The MCV is almost 20 years old and upgrades would involve replacing different
parts of the vehicle. This work would be conducted by the City of Berkeley’s
Corporation Yard. The cost would be staff time plus the cost of any necessary
parts.
(4) Impact:
The MCV is used as a command post for any large scaled event. It works as a mobile
central location where resources can stage and be deployed from. It provides the
police department with on-site command, supplying a control and communications
hub that is needed for large community events, or critical incidents such as natural
disasters in order to maintain public safety.
(5) Mitigations:
The MCV shall only be operated by trained personnel that have demonstrated
proficiency in the operations of this vehicle per Berkeley Police Department Policy
811.
(6) Alternatives:
The MCV is almost 20 years old. Current MCV from other agencies are large mobile
homes converted into MCVs.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
All maintenance is completed through the Cities Corp Yard so there is no
dependence on a third party.
Barrett Model 99 Rifle
(1) Description:
A. Background:
The Barrett Model 99 rifle is a single shot bolt-action 50-caliber rifle first
54 | P ageInternal
introduced in 1999. It is intended to be used in emergency situations where there
is a high potential for violence.
B. Quantity:
Berkeley Police Department Special Response Team (SRT) currently possess 1
(one) of these rifles and is not looking to purchase any others.
Currently BPD has approximately 100 Summit Ammunition .50-caliber BNG
rounds.
C. Capability:
This rifle is used only in situations where a potential life-threatening situation
exists. The length of the rifle’s barrel coupled with the ammunition result in
precision accuracy. This rifle is capable of disabling any vehicle engine block
because of the large caliber round.
D. Lifespan:
This rifle has been in our possession for almost 15-years and we expect it to last
for an additional 20 years or more considering how in-frequently it’s used.
E. Use:
This rifle is used primarily in emergency situations where a life-threatening
situation exists, necessitating a vehicle to be disabled.
F. How it Works:
This is a bolt-action rifle that fires one round at a time and needs to be reloaded
by hand after each round. The Barrett Model 99 rifle works similar to all modern
bolt-action rifles. When the trigger is pressed, a firing pin strikes the primer of a
bullet loaded into the chamber of the rifle. The ignited primer ignites gun
powder contained in the bullet which pushes the bullet down the barrel and out
the muzzle. The operator pulls the bolt back, ejecting the spent cartridge. The
operator then loads another bullet into the breach, pushes the bolt forward, and
closes the chamber, making the rifle ready to fired again.
(2) Purpose:
The Barrett rifle is a firearm that may be used to stop a vehicle which poses a lethal
threat to the public, or to disable a vehicle which presents a threat to the safety of
another person(s) by its continued use. There are vehicle disabling tools that may
disable vehicles by slowly deflating the tires; however, even with tires deflated a
vehicle has the ability to operate and remain a threat to the public. Furthermore,
55 | P ageInternal
these tools must be hand deployed and, in most circumstances, require officers to
expose themselves to deadly threats. The Barrett rifle creates the ability to
effectively disable vehicles instantaneously from a distance away.
(3) Fiscal Cost:
A. Initial Cost:
The Barrett Model 99 50-caliber rifle has a retail cost of approximately $12,500
dollars. The Department of Justice provided the Barrett rifle to the Berkeley
Police Department on 04/04/2007. There was no initial cost related to BPD taking
possession of it.
B. Cost of Use:
The costs associated with its proposed uses is in the expenditure of its
ammunition. The ammunition has a retail cost of approximately $6 dollars per
bullet; $60 for a box of 10 and $600 for a case of 10 boxes, plus shipping and
handling. We currently possess 100 rounds of BMG ammunition.
C. Cost of Potential Adverse Effects:
Adverse effects of improper use of a firearm are not calculable. It could lead to
the loss of life or serious injury. Additionally, the improper use could result in
civil liabilities.
D. Annual and Ongoing Costs:
The annual cost of the equipment is minimal and includes ammunition
expenditure, cleaning equipment, and possibly replacing the optics at some point
in the future.
E. Training Costs:
The cost associated with training is the staff time, range fees, and cost of spent
ammunition.
F. Maintenance and Storage Costs:
Maintenance costs vary depending on use over time and will vary. There are no
costs associated with maintenance or storage of ammunition. All ammunition is
stored in a climate-controlled room in the Berkeley Police Department.
G. Upgrade Costs:
Improvements in technology and new designs may be an additional cost but we
can’t predict what those will be at this time.
56 | P ageInternal
Should advancements be made in ammunition manufacturing; those upgrade
costs are unknown at this time.
(4) Impact:
The Berkeley Police Department is committed to preserving and protecting human
life and welfare. The Barrett rifle is a firearm the department would primarily use to
stop a vehicle which poses a lethal threat to the public or used to disable a vehicle
that presents a threat to the safety of another person(s) by its continued use.
The Barrett rifle is intended as a tool to increase the safety and welfare of
community members and officers alike.
The Barrett rifle has minimal or no impact on civil rights or civil liberties as it will only
be deployed in very specific situations, by very select members of the SRT. This is not
a piece of equipment that is carried by an officer on routine patrol, and is highly
unlikely that any members of our community would ever see this equipment due to
its very selective use in the most critical of instances.
(5) Mitigations:
Only four BPD members are authorized to utilize this rifle. Authorized members are
trained in its use as well as the very specific and limited circumstances where this
equipment would be utilized.
(6) Alternatives:
There is no other alternative tool or asset available that could accomplish the same
goal of this rifle. An alternative rifle to the Barrett model 99 is a different rifle of
equal capability, such as a Lapua .338 caliber rifle.
(7) Third Party Dependence:
These rifles are simple in their design and operation. They do require regular
maintenance which is performed by an SRT Team Leader. If an issue arises which is
beyond the scope of our Armorers we would seek manufacturer assistance.
However, the need for this is expected to be very rare.

1300 BWC APPENDIX A.pdf
Copyright Lexipol, LLC 2023/11/13, All Rights Reserved. 1300 BWC APPENDIX A.pdf - 986
Published with permission by Berkeley Police Department1300 APPENDIX A
BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
BODY WORN CAMERAS (BWCs)
A. DESCRIPTION
The BWC system consists of four main components: The camera, the docking station, and the
Digital Information Management System (DIMS) and smartphone applications.
The first component, the Axon camera, is a system which incorporates an audio and video
recording device. It is designed to record events in real time for secure storage, retrieval, and
analysis. The camera is to be attached to an officer’s uniform and is powered by an internal
rechargeable battery. The camera features low-light performance, full-shift battery life, a
capture rate of 30 frames per second with no dropped frames, HD video, pre-event buffering,
multi-camera playback, and the ability to automatically categorize video using the police
department’s computer aided dispatch system. An officer can start and stop recording by
pressing a button on the front of the camera. The camera does not contain a screen for footage
review.
The second component of the system is the docking station. Once the Axon camera is placed in
the docking station it recharges the camera’s battery. The dock also triggers the uploading of
data from the camera to a cloud based Digital Information Management System (DIMS) called
Evidence.com. The dock does not directly provide functionality to view, modify or delete video
data stored on Axon cameras.
The third component is the Digital Information Management System called Evidence.com.
Evidence.com streamlines data management and sharing on one secure platform. The evidence
management system is comprehensive, secure, and intuitive to use. The DIMS is located in a
cloud-based data center for security, scalability, and ease of administration. Users can add
1300 BWC APPENDIX A.docx 11300 APPENDIX A
BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
metadata to existing videos such as associated case numbers, incident type, incident
dispositions, etc. to make the videos easier to find. However, the videos themselves cannot be
altered by the user.
The fourth component of the system to be utilized are two Axon mobile applications, which
allow officers to collect and review evidence in the field and more effectively use their BWCs.
The applications use secure Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technology to access the BWC systems and
footage. These applications are compliant with US Department of Justice evidentiary standards,
meaning that they are both secure and are set up in a way that prohibits the altering or
destruction of evidence. The applications are called Axon View and Axon Capture. Axon View
allows users to change their camera settings, view live video, and review and tag recorded
videos while they are stored on the BWC. Recorded videos remain in the BWC’s memory, and
cannon be manipulated or deleted. Axon Capture allows officers to use their city-issued
smartphone’s camera and microphone to take photographs, and record audio and video, and
to upload this data directly to Evidence.com. These applications do not allow users to alter,
manipulate, or edit any of the footage recorded by the BWC. These applications use secure
technology to add value and efficiency to the BWC program.
B. PURPOSE
The primary objective of the BWC system is to document officer contacts, arrests, and critical
incidents. Video footage collected by the BWCs will be used as evidence in both criminal and
administrative investigations. Video footage not relevant to any investigation will be discarded
after a defined retention period.
In instances where the officer might be expected to take law enforcement action of any kind,
the officer is expected to record the encounter for the benefit of both the officer and the
member of the public.
1. The BWC shall be activated in any of the following situations:
i. All in-person enforcement and investigative contacts including pedestrian stops and
field interview (FI) situations.
ii. Traffic stops including, but not limited to, traffic violations, stranded motorist
assistance and all crime interdiction stops.
iii. Self-initiated field contacts in which a member would normally notify the
Communications Center.
iv. Any search activity, including the service of search or arrest warrants; probation,
parole, or consent searches where the member is seeking evidence of an offense, or
conducting a safety sweep or community caretaking sweep of the premises. Once a
location has been secured and the member is not interacting with detainees or
arrestees, the member may mute their BWC when conducting a search for evidence.
1300 BWC APPENDIX A.docx 21300 APPENDIX A
BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
v. Any other contact that the member determines has become adversarial after the
initial contact in a situation where the member would not otherwise activate BWC
recording.
vi. Transporting any detained or arrested person and where a member facilitates entry
into or out of a vehicle, or any time the member expects to have physical contact
with that person.
At no time is an officer expected to jeopardize his or her safety in order to activate a BWC. The
BWC should be activated in anticipation of situations described above, and in any unanticipated,
rapidly unfolding situation where activation becomes required, as soon as the user can do so
safely.
Officers should activate their BWC when conducting custodial interviews unless there are other
recording devices being used. Officers shall document and explain in their report the reason for
not recording custodial interviews, should a BWC be de-activated while conducting a custodial
interview or interrogation.
2. Prohibited uses of the BWC system include:
i. Officers shall not surreptitiously record another department member without a
court order unless lawfully authorized by the Chief of Police, or his/her designee.
ii. Officers are prohibited from using a department-issued BWC for personal use and
are prohibited from making personal copies of recordings created while on duty or
while acting in their official capacity.
iii. Officers are prohibited from retaining BWC recordings.
iv. Officers shall not duplicate or distribute such recordings, except for department
business purposes.
C. LOCATION
Officers may use BWCs anywhere where officers have jurisdiction to operate as sworn officers,
in accordance with BPD policy #425.
D. IMPACT
With the introduction of BWCs, officers record all enforcement contacts with the public. To that
end, an officer could find themselves engaged in their lawful duties in both public and private
areas. Additionally, due to the nature of law enforcement work, an officer may be required to
engage in sensitive conversations with individuals of all ages, including children.
The right to maintain someone's anonymity versus the need to gain information to maintain
public safety is of paramount concern. The Department recognizes that all people have a right
to privacy and is committed to protecting and safeguarding civil rights by adhering to the
1300 BWC APPENDIX A.docx 31300 APPENDIX A
BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
strictest requirements of both state and federal law concerning release of audio/video
recordings.
E. MITIGATION
In order to minimize violations of privacy, BWC policy provides that:
1. Officers should record any incident they feel would be appropriate or valuable to
document. The BWC policy shall require officers to activate the BWC under the criteria
listed above.
2. Officers should not activate the BWC and/or use caution when entering a public locker
room, changing room, restroom, doctor's or attorney's office, or other place where
individuals unrelated to the investigation are present and would have a heightened
expectation of privacy unless the officer is investigating criminal activity or responding to
a call for service.
3. BWC use is limited to enforcement and investigative activates involving members of the
public. The BWC recordings will capture video and audio evidence for use in criminal
investigations, administrative reviews, training, civil litigation, and other proceedings
protected by confidentiality laws and department policy.
4. BWC footage will be retained or released in accordance with applicable state and federal
law. Criminal defendants will have access to relevant BWC footage via the court discovery
process.
5. Officers are prohibited from retaining BWC recordings, Officers shall not duplicate or
distribute such recordings, except for department business purposes. All such recordings
shall be retained at the Department.
6. Officers are prohibited from intentionally erasing, altering, reusing, modifying or
tampering with original audio video recordings. Officers may request restriction and
subsequent deletion of an accidental recording according to the BWC policy.
7. Access to recorded files will be granted for the purposes of review in response to a public
records request, as permitted by law and department policy. Department policy does not
authorize release of investigative files or documents that would constitute an
unwarranted invasions of privacy. Circumstances where this might arise in video include
footage taken inside a home, a medical facility, the scene of a medical emergency, or
where an individual recorded has a “reasonable expectation of privacy
F. DATA TYPES AND SOURCES
BWC use is limited to enforcement and investigative activities involving members of the public.
The BWC recordings will capture video and audio evidence for use in criminal investigations,

BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
The BWC collects video and audio recordings of events occurring in the user’s presence. As each
video is created, the system automatically stamps the video with the current date/time and the
camera user’s identity. The user has the option to add metadata manually to existing recordings
after they are created. Such metadata may include but is not limited to:
1. Category of contact (from Department’s defined list)
2. Disposition of contact (arrest, citation, etc.)
3. Associated case number
G. DATA SECURITY
To assist with identifying and preserving data and recordings, members shall tag and download
recordings in accordance with procedure, and document the existence of the recording in the
related case report. Transfers must occur at the end of the member’s shift, and any time the
member is aware that the storage capacity of the BWC is nearing its limit. In circumstances when
the officer cannot complete this task, the officer’s supervisor shall immediately take custody of
the BWC and be responsible for transferring the data into the digital evidence management
system. Officers shall tag each file with the appropriate case/incident number, provide a
descriptive title, and select an appropriate category for each recording, using the Axon View app
or via the Evidence.com site.
Members are prohibited from intentionally erasing, altering, reusing, modifying or tampering
with original audio video recordings.
Improper use or release of BWC recordings may compromise ongoing criminal and
administrative investigations or violate the privacy rights of those recorded and is prohibited.
The Chief of Police, or his/her designee shall appoint a member of the Department to coordinate
the use and maintenance of BWCs and the storage of recordings, including (Penal Code Section
832.18) (Ref. policy 425.14):
1. Establishing a system for uploading, storing and security of recordings.
2. Designating persons responsible for uploading recorded data.
3. Establishing a maintenance system to ensure availability of BWCs.
4. Establishing a system for tagging and categorizing data according to the type of incident
captured.
5. Establishing a system to prevent tampering, deleting and copying recordings and ensure
chain of custody integrity.
6. Working with the City Attorney’s office to ensure an appropriate retention schedule is
being applied to recordings and associated documentation.
7. Maintaining an audit trail record for all access to evidence files, wherein access
information for each evidence file is logged through use of a secure log-in system. The
Department’s storage system associates an audit trail record with each evidence file,
1300 BWC APPENDIX A.docx 51300 APPENDIX A
BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
thereby logging the date, time, user name, activity and client IP address occurring during
each evidence file access.
H. FISCAL COST
In 2017, the Berkeley City Council approved a resolution authorizing a contract between BPD
and Axon. Axon was chosen after a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process. The
contract will not exceed $1,218,103 and includes the cost of 200 body worn cameras, charging
stations, accessories, software licenses, training and unlimited storage for five years. The
purchase also includes replacement cameras and charging stations during the third and fifth
year of the contract.
There will be an annual cost of approximately $250,000 to the police department's budget for
a staff person to administer the body worn camera program beginning in FY 2019.
I. THIRD PARTY DEPENDENCE AND ACCESS
All BWC data will be uploaded and stored on Axon Cloud Services, Evidence.com. Axon complies
with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set
forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of
personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States
(collectively, “Privacy Shield”). Axon has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it
adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
J. ALTERNATIVES
Officers rely primarily on traditional policing techniques to gather evidence related to criminal
investigations such as speaking to witnesses and suspects, gathering information from
observations, and using standard data aggregation systems. These methods will continue to be
employed as primary investigative tools that will be supplemented by use of BWCs to document
police activity.
BWC technology provides video and audio documentation of policing activity in addition to the
oral and written statements of officers, victims, and witnesses. Alternatives to the use of BWCs
would be vehicle-based cameras and/or not utilizing BWCs. However, BPD sees the use of BWCs
as an integral strategy to strengthen police transparency, prevent and resolve complaints
against the police by civilians, document police-public interaction, and promote the perceived
legitimacy and sense of procedural justice that communities have about their departments.
There is a broad consensus – among community leaders, the ACLU, the Department of Justice,
the Berkeley Police Department, and elected officials – that body-worn cameras can be an
important tool for improving the high-quality public service expected of police officers.

BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT SURVEILLANCE ACQUISITION REPORT - BODY WORN CAMERAS
K. EXPERIENCE OF OTHER ENTITIES
Numerous police agencies have adopted BWCs as a tool to help combat crime, to reduce citizen
complaints and to reduce use of force situations. Many departments have developed their own
usage policies which may include standards for required officer use, supervisory review, storage
and data retention standards, and internal and public access.
A report for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Administration, https://www.bja.gov/bwc/pdfs/14-
005_Report_BODY_WORN_CAMERAS.pdf - pages 6-8, cites a 2013 Rialto, CA study that showed
that the use of BWCs led to a 59 percent decrease in UOF and an 87.5 percent decrease in citizen
complaints. Likewise, the Mesa, AZ report noted in “Impact” Section above also points to large
decreases in UOF and citizen complaints.
The 2017 Police Body Worn Cameras: A Policy Scorecard, https://www.bwcscorecard.org/,
provides an analysis of how scores of different police agencies have employed BWCs through a
defined list of metrics.

From: Captain J. Louis #C2
Subject: Captain’s Instruction: Call-Taking
This Captain’s Instruction on the Call-Taking procedure now includes a section on profiling by proxy. This
instruction is effective immediately pending an update into the Communications Center Operations Manual.
CALL TAKING
SCOPE
The function of the Dispatcher working call taking is to provide 24 hour a day service to the public for information
as well as routine or emergency assistance. Dispatchers shall follow these standardized procedures and
expectations for call processing.
CALL TAKER EXPECTATIONS
1. CONTROLLING THE CALL: Where, What, When, Weapons, Who: The call taker should maintain
control of the call in order to receive the answers to the most important questions in the shortest period
of time.
2. VERIFICATION AND ACCURACY: Verify details that are received through the initial line of
questioning: The call taker will use active listening and repeat back to the caller the information he/she
provided in order to confirm the documented details.
3. COMPASSION AND PATIENCE
a. Help the caller understand what is happening: The call taker will use a firm yet reassuring
tone of voice with the caller, stating that you are going to help and will need to ask a number of
questions in order to do so.
b. Commit the caller to staying on the line and working with you as long as it is safe to do
so: The call taker will state that it is very important for the caller to remain on the line as long as
it is safe to do so, and to provide the best information possible in response to the questions
being asked. The call taker will inform the caller that there will be some moments of silence or
side conversations with other Dispatchers as the details are being entered, they are not being
ignored, nor ending the call, and not to hang up during these periods.
c. Explain what will happen next: The call taker will remain on the line with the caller as long as
practicable to continue information gathering. However, if it is necessary to end the call the call
taker will advise the caller a call for service request has been completed. If the caller asks
when officers might arrive, the call taker may state they cannot estimate the time and there may
be delays due to higher-priority calls or high call volume.
4. PROFESSIONALISM: Speak calmly and clearly and with enough volume for the caller to hear
you. The call taker should project authority, yet portray understanding and empathy through a steady
and reassuring tone. Speak in clear and understandable terms; do not use departmental codes or
jargon.

E-mail: police@cityofberkeley.info Website: http://www.cityofberkeley.info/police5. RESPECT:
a. Do not demonstrate an argumentative demeanor, and do not question the integrity or validity
of the caller or the reported incident. What may appear improbable or unlikely upon first report
may in fact be what has occurred.
b. Do not use sarcasm or diminish the caller’s perceived importance/urgency of the
reported situation. Do not patronize the caller. All callers should be treated with
understanding and dignity, regardless of how well they can articulate or explain what has
occurred and/or how well they are able to cooperate/comply with the call intake process.
PROCEDURE FOR INFORMATION GATHERING
The call taker shall obtain the basic information from the caller using the 5 W’s format (Where, What, When,
Weapons, Who), as well as any secondary questioning necessary to provide pertinent information. When
appropriate, the call taker may ask callers near the end of the call if there is anything they would like to add. All
information must be documented in the narrative window of the CAD mask.
1. WHERE (Location): The call taker will make every attempt to enter an accurate location of where the
Incident occurred into the CAD call mask.
The call taker shall request the exact location of the incident (structure addresses, intersections).
If the specific location is unknown, the call taker shall request landmarks or estimated proximity to
landmarks.
The call taker will tell the caller and any witnesses to remain at their current location (unless determined
unsafe) until officers arrive.
Address Verification. The call taker shall verify all addresses reported. This can be accomplished by
matching the ALI display, repeating the address, and/or enunciating each digit of the address.
2. WHAT (Nature of the Incident): The call taker will question the caller in order to ascertain what
happened.
Determine the appropriate call type.
Ask the caller if there are injuries or if anyone requires medical attention. If medical attention is
required, copy call to Fire, document the nature of the injuries and status of scene security in
the call’s narrative. If there are injuries and no police response is required, the call taker will then
transfer the caller to ACCREC for pre-arrival instructions (ref. EMD policy).
3. WHEN (Time of Occurrence): The call taker will question the caller to ascertain when the incident
occurred. The call taker will determine if the incident is in-progress, just prior, or a cold report.
In Progress: Incidents occurring now or within past 2 minutes
Just Prior: Incidents occurring 2-10 minutes prior or incidents occurring more than 10 minutes prior and
the responsible is still on scene or in the area.
Cold Reports: Incidents occurring more than 10 minutes prior and the responsible is no longer in the
area.
If the call type is a priority 1 or 2 and the incident is in-progress, just prior (10 minutes or less), or if the
suspect is still on scene, the call taker will make the call “ready for dispatch” as soon as practicable
after the incident location is verified and the call type is determined.
4. WEAPONS (First Responder/Citizen Safety Hazards): The call taker will ascertain if there are any
weapons involved or other potential on-scene hazards.
2100 Martin Luther King Jr. Way. Berkeley, CA 94704 Tel: 510.981.5900 TDD: 510.981.5799 Fax: 510.981.5960
E-mail: police@cityofberkeley.info Website: http://www.cityofberkeley.info/policeWeapons: The call taker will ask the caller if any weapons were seen, simulated or threatened.
Intoxicated or Mentally Disturbed Subjects: The call taker will ask secondary questions when a caller
reports a subject behaving erratically or unusually.
The call taker will ask the caller if there are any other on-scene hazards that could potentially harm
responding units.
5. WHO (Descriptions of Involved Subjects): The call taker will attempt to obtain full subject
descriptions using the following questioning sequence:
Race and/or Complexion; Gender; Age (or Approximate); Height, Weight, Hair/Facial (Color, length,
style); Eyes (Glasses); Headwear; Coat; Shirt/Dress; Pants/Shorts/Skirt; Shoes; and Other Distinctive
Features
For in-progress or just prior priority 1 and 2 calls, the call taker will ascertain whether the subject is still in
sight or if they have left the scene. If the subject has left the scene, the call taker will first ask the caller for the
direction of travel, time element and a description of the method of transportation (i.e. foot, vehicle, or bicycle).
The call taker will enter this information as soon as practicable into the narrative.
The following order should be used to document descriptions of transportation methods:
1. Vehicles: The call taker will use the CYMBAL format (Color, Year, Make, Body type, Additional
Characteristics, License plate) to ask the caller for a description of a vehicle. The call taker will also ask
the number of occupants, position of suspect (i.e. Driver, front or rear seat passenger) and direction of
travel.
2. Bus: The call taker will ask the caller the Bus Company, coach number, route number and direction of
travel.
3. BART: The call taker will ask the caller the BART station name, platform information and train
destination information (i.e. Richmond, Fremont, San Francisco) and train direction
4. Bicycle: The call taker will ask the caller the bike color, type, brand (i.e. Black, mountain bike,
Diamondback) and direction of travel.
PROFILING BY PROXY
Bias, racism or profiling by proxy occurs in a call for service when an individual calls the police and makes false
or ill-informed claims about persons they dislike or are biased against. Dispatchers and Officers have a role in
mitigating bias-based calls for service (CFS), and proper handling of these calls is important to maintain and
build trust between the police and the community.
Call takers have a responsibility to do an initial screen and triage of all calls to ensure they are accurately
entered as the correct CFS with the appropriate priority attached. Call takers should ask questions and explore
whether there are concrete, observable behaviors that form the basis of the suspicious activity or crime the RP
is reporting. Calls for service (CFS) should focus on behaviors of involved parties, not appearance. Reports of
suspicious activity require the reporting party (RP) to articulate something criminal or reasonably suspicious
about a person’s behavior.
If a Call Taker believes an RP is making a bias-based call for service, they should:
1. Create a call for service,
2. Enter the details provided by the RP in the call narrative
3. In the Nature of Call field enter: “Supervisor review required” which will ensure that the call is not
ready for dispatch, and
4. Notify the on duty supervisor. Supervisor will review the merits of the call for service and either
approve for dispatching or notify a Watch Commander (or designee)
5. Watch Commander will determine if a response will be provided and/or follow-up up with the RP for
more information.

number, was an instrumentality used in the peace officer’ s presence in violation of
Section 2800.1, 2800.2, 2800.3, or 23103, shall issue a warrant or order authorizing
any peace officer to immediately seize and cause the remo val of the vehicle. The

CAPTAINS INSTRUCTION
Date: February 16, 2023
To: Sworn Personnel
Form: Captain Dan Montgomery #C2
Subject: Livestreaming of Body Worn Cameras
The Berkeley Police Department recognizes that video recording of contacts between
department personnel and the public provides an objective record of these events, and that
the use of a recording system complements field personnel in the performance of their duties
by providing a video record of enforcement and investigative field contacts, which can
enhance criminal prosecutions, limit civil liability, increase transparency, and enhance
professionalism in the delivery of police services to the community. (BPD Policy 425.2)
As Body Worn Camera technology develops, new procedures or rules may become necessary.
One of the new functions of our Axon Body 3 Body Worn Camera (BWC) is that a supervisor
can remotely livestream into another officer’s camera view while the officer is actively
recording. If a camera is not actively recording it cannot be viewed remotely. When a
supervisor remotes into an officer’s camera, the officer is notified in the following ways:
• The BWC will give one short vibration.
• On the digital screen the word “Live” will be visible.
• The camera will give one audible beep. *
• The BWC’s light will change from red to purple. *
(*If the officer has the sound muted and lights off, then the purple light and beep will not
happen.)
A supervisor should only live stream into another officer’s BWC in the following situations:
• Incidents that are pre-planned between the officer and supervisor.
• Incidents where the officer requests a supervisor live stream in.
• Situations where an officer is not responding to their radio.
• Situations deemed exigent by the supervisor.
2100 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Berkeley, CA 94704 Tel: 510.981.5700 TDD: 510.981.5799 Fax: 510.981.5704
E-mail: police@ci.berkeley.ca.us• Situations authorized by the Watch Commander
In no case should livestreaming an officers BWC be used to substitute in person supervision.
Under ideal circumstances, a supervisor should contact the officer and advise them before
remoting into their BWC. In situations where it is not practical to notify the officer, the
supervisor shall notify them that they activated the live stream function as soon as safe to do
so.

CAPTAIN’S INSTRUCTION
Date: February 16, 2023
To: Sworn Personnel
Form: Captain Dan Montgomery #C2
Subject: Livestreaming of Body Worn Cameras
One of the functions of our Axon Body 3 Body Worn Camera (BWC) is that a supervisor can
remotely livestream into another officer’s camera view while the officer is actively recording.
If a camera is not actively recording it cannot be viewed remotely. When a supervisor remotes
into an officer’s camera, the officer is notified in the following ways:
• The BWC will give one short vibration.
• On the digital screen the word “Live” will be visible.
• The camera will give one audible beep. *
• The BWC’s light will change from red to purple. *
(*If the officer has the sound muted and lights off, then the purple light and beep will not
happen.)
A supervisor should only live stream into another officer’s BWC in the following situations:
• Incidents that are pre-planned between the officer and supervisor.
• Incidents where the officer requests a supervisor live stream in.
• Situations where an officer is not responding to their radio.
• Situations deemed exigent by the supervisor.
• Situations authorized by the Watch Commander
In no case should livestreaming an officers BWC be used to substitute in person supervision.
Under ideal circumstances, a supervisor should contact the officer and advise them before
remoting into their BWC. In situations where it is not practical to notify the officer, the
supervisor shall notify them that they activated the live stream function as soon as safe to do
so.

PREFACE
As you read this; somewhere in California, a law enforcement agency is providing mutual aid.
Mutual aid is an everyday occurrence in a state as large and diverse as California. This is the
continuation of a Cal OES decades-long process of “neighbor helping neighbor.” The law
enforcement mutual aid system is an ongoing cooperative effort among law enforcement agencies to
ensure an effective and organized response to a wide range of emergencies. There may be a
misconception that mutual aid is used only during a civil unrest and/or natural disaster; however,
this system has been used successfully for many other situations, including large criminal
investigations, deployment of special teams such as Special Weapons and Tactics Teams, Bomb
Squads, etc.
How will your agency use the mutual aid system? Planning, preparation and operational activities
of law enforcement agencies in support of the mutual aid system must be consistent with each
department’s policies and procedures and must also comply with the Standardized Emergency
Management System (SEMS) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS).
All law enforcement executives, administrators, managers, and field supervisors should familiarize
themselves with this plan and its application. The personnel of the Cal OES Law Enforcement
Branch are available to assist you with planning, training and when necessary, emergency response
coordination. It is important to note that Cal OES does not “own” the mutual aid system. It is a part
of California law enforcement; and those that participate benefit and share in the concept of
“neighbor helping neighbor.”

INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services original Law Enforcement Guide for
Emergency Operations was developed in response to the need for standardization and
uniformity of organization and response on the part of law enforcement agencies involved in
major multi-jurisdictional and multi-agency incidents such as a civil disorder, technological
disaster, or natural disaster.
The revised and expanded 2019 Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations is designed
to be a practical field-oriented guide to assist law enforcement personnel throughout the State of
California with implementation of the Field Level Incident Command System. The intended
primary users of this guide are watch commanders and field supervisors. The guide can also be
an excellent emergency response tool for law enforcement managers, as well as line officers and
deputies.
This updated edition incorporates the concept and statutory requirement of the Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS). Additionally, the Law Enforcement Incident
Command System, as approved by the SEMS Law Enforcement Specialist Committee, is
presented in this publication. Please disregard earlier editions of this guide.
The Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations is organized in a user-friendly format
consisting of overview text, diagrams, organization charts, checklists, forms, and a glossary.
Several sections are suitable for photocopying and distribution to field personnel.
The ultimate goal is to provide practical guidance for California law enforcement agencies in
using the SEMS and ICSS organizational framework for efficient and safe response,
management, and coordination of major emergencies and disasters.

SECTION I
OVERVIEW OF THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)is the emergency management
organization required by California statute, Government Code 8607(a) for emergency response
and disaster management in multi-agency and multi-jurisdiction emergencies. California local
governments mustuse SEMS in emergency response and disaster management to be eligible for
any available disaster reimbursement funding for its personnel related costs provided through
state disaster assistance programs. SEMSincorporates the use of:
The Incident Command System(ICS):Field level emergency management response system
and organization.
Multi/Inter-Agency Coordination:The participation of agencies and disciplines involved at
any level of the SEMS organization working together in a coordinated effort to facilitate
decisions for overall emergency response activities, including the sharing of critical resources
and the prioritization of incidents.
Mutual Aid Systems:Voluntarily provided local government services, resources and facilities
when emergency impacted jurisdiction resources are exhausted or inadequate.
The Operational Area Concept:The management and application of resources of all political
subdivisions (cities and special districts) of a county.
PURPOSE OF SEMS:
SEMS was established to provide an effective and coordinated response to multi-agency and
multi-jurisdictional emergencies in California. By standardizing key components of the
emergency management system, SEMS is intended to:
 Facilitate the flow of information within and between all levels of the system.
 Facilitate interaction and coordination among all responding agencies.
The use of SEMS will improve the processes of mobilization, deployment, tracking, and
demobilization of needed mutual aid resources.
The use of SEMS will reduce the incidence of ineffective coordination and communications,
and avoid duplication of resource ordering in multi-agency and multi-jurisdiction response
actions.
SEMS is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the varied types of disasters that occur in
California and to meet the needs of all emergency responders.
LEVELS OF SEMS:
SEMS provides for five distinct organizational levels of emergency response and disaster
management, which may be activated as necessary:
• Field Response
• Local Government
• Operational Area
• Regional
• StateLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 10
Field Response Level: Emergency response level where personnel and resources carry out
tactical decisions and activities under the command of an appropriate authority in direct
response to an incident or threat.
Local Government Level:The level that includes cities, counties, and special districts. Local
governments manage and coordinate the overall emergency response and recovery activities
within their jurisdiction.
Operational Area Level: An intermediate level of the state's emergency services organization,
which includes the county and all political subdivisions situated within the county. The
operational area manages and/or coordinates information, resources, and priorities among local
governments within the Operational Area and serves as the coordination and communication
link between the local government level and the regional level.
Regional Level: The level that manages and coordinates information and resources among
operational areas within the mutual aid region and between the operational areas and the state
level. This level also coordinates overall state agency support for emergency response activities
within the region.
State Level:The level that manages state resources in response to emergency needs of the other
levels, and manages and coordinates mutual aid among the mutual aid regions and between the
regional level and the state level. State level also serves as the initial coordination and
communication link with the federal response system.
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTERS (EOC),
DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CENTERS (DOC) AND INCIDENT COMMANDER (IC):
SEMS regulations require that upon activation of a Local Government Emergency Operations
Center (EOC), communications and coordination will be established between the Incident
Commander and the response Department's Operations Center (DOC) to the EOC, or directly
between the Incident Commander and the Local Government EOC.
The regulations further require that communications and coordination be established between an
activated Local Government EOC and any state or local emergency response agency having
responsibilities at an incident occurring within that local government's jurisdictional boundary.
ICS field response organizations must establish communications with the local government
level. The jurisdiction's dispatching procedures, communication capabilities, and local policies,
will determine how the field level is linked to the local government level.
In many instances, the ICS field response units will be linked primarily to its DOC having
jurisdictional responsibility for the incident. In such cases, the DOC retains agency-level
authority over their assigned Incident Commander(s). The DOC is then responsible for
coordinating with the Local Government EOC.
EOC
DOC
ICPLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 11
In some incidents, ICS field response organizations may have a direct communications link with
the Local Government EOC when it is activated. The ICS field unit may receive policy direction
from the Local Government EOC in certain circumstances. Whether or not this direct linkage
occurs will depend upon the size of the emergency event, existing policies of the jurisdiction
and the available lines of communication.
ESSENTIAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS:
SEMS has five essential functions adopted from the Incident Command System. The field
response level uses the five primary ICS functions:
 Command
 Operations
 Planning/Intelligence
 Logistics
 Finance/Administration
At the Local Government, Operational Area, Regional and State levels, the term managementis
appropriately substituted for the term command. The titles given the other functions remain the
same at all levels.
The concept of using this structure within the SEMS Field Response organization is based on
the following:
• Develop the form of the organization to match the function or task to be performed.
• Staff only those functional elements that are required to perform the task.
• Observe the recommended span-of-control guidelines.
• Perform the function of any non-activated organizational element at the next highest level.
• Deactivate elements no longer required by the incident.
COMMON FEATURES OF ALL ORGANIZATIONAL/RESPONSE LEVELS:
SEMS has several features based on ICS. The field response level uses functions, principles,
and components of ICS as required in SEMS regulations.
Many of these field response level features also are applicable at local government, operational
area, regional and state levels. In addition, there are other ICS features that have application to
all SEMS levels.
Listed below are the features of ICS,which are applicable to all SEMS levels:
• Organizational Flexibility/Modular Organization
• Organizational Unity and Hierarchy of Command/Management
• Manageable Span of Control
• Personnel Accountability
• Common Terminology
• Compressive Resource Management
• Integrated Communications
• Action PlanningLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

SECTION II
Appyling the Incident Command System
REQUIREMENT TO USE ICS:
SEMS regulations state that where an agency has jurisdictional authority over a multiple-agency
incident,it shall organize the field response using ICS. An incident is defined as an occurrence
or event, human-caused or by natural phenomena, which requires action by emergency response
personnel to prevent or minimize loss of life or damage to property, including natural resources.
In the most rigid sense, ICS within the SEMS Regulations need only be used in incidents, which
require multiple agencies, or multiple jurisdictional involvement whether they are single
discipline (e.g., all fire services or all law enforcement) or multi-discipline. Establishing the ICS
would be required whenever an emergency incident involves more than one response agency.
LAW ENFORCEMENT ICS TRAINING GUIDELINES:
As use of the ICS in the law enforcement profession continues, new training methodsmay be
developed to meet specific needs. At the present time there are two principle training reference
documents that outline the acceptable SEMS/ICS curriculum approved by the Commission on
Peace Officer Standards and Training(POST).
POST requires that a law enforcement agency train its personnel according to the curriculum set
forth in the SEMS Approved Course of Instruction (which providesamulti-discipline SEMS
overview) and the CalOESLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations(which provides
a law enforcement-specific field level ICS guidance). Together,these documents will provide
an agency with information to train and implement ICS for emergency response with the added
benefit of focusing on law enforcement organizational concerns.
Will it be necessary to establish minimum qualifications and certifications for law enforcement
ICS practitioners? No; not at the present time. ICS certification and qualifications are found in
the fire service where ICS has developed over time and this has worked well for them. Within
law enforcement, where training time is in constant competition with response time and calls for
service, the certification and qualification of ICS practitioners maynot be imposed. It is
sufficient for an Agency,to self-certifythat its personnel have received the appropriate level of
SEMS/ICS proficiency training for law enforcement and to effectively implement that training
in an actual incident requiring the use of ICS.

Page 15
ICS IS RECOMMENDED FOR ANY INCIDENT:
As a matter of practice and training,it is of great benefit for agencies to utilize ICS for
managing routineincidents. This practice provides a seamless integration of ICS into larger
emergency operations as the situation evolves.
Typically, incidents begin with a single response discipline but may expand rapidly to multi-
discipline incidents requiring additional resources. One of the dilemmas often confronting field
response agencies has been a "gray area" of when exactly to establish ICS or to continue using
an existing agency emergency response system that does not incorporate ICS principles.
There may be reluctance or hesitancy for an emergency response agency engaged in emergency
operations using its own department's emergency configuration to attempt a transition to form
the Incident Command System. This dilemma may be avoided by adopting ICS as the agency's
sole emergency management organization. ICS is a management system, which can be used
virtually in anyemergency or incident.
A basic premise of ICS use is that in each emergency or incident, regardless of its size, the
principles of ICS apply. The first on-scene emergency responder has single-discipline
management responsibility. If the responder is aware of and follows the primary ICS functions,
then that person and that department are actually using ICS in day-to-day performance.
Initial response to an emerging situation may consist of one or two officers in a patrol car.
Generally, the senior officer assumes the role of the Incident Commander (IC). As IC, this
officer is responsible for the accomplishment of all the applicable functions under the ICS
organization. In a small incident the officer (as IC) may gather information (intelligence),
formulate a plan (planning), request one or two units (logistics), deploy the officers, and resolve
the problem (operations), release the requested units (demobilize), complete required reports
(administration), and perhaps submit a request for overtime (finance).
In a rapidly expanding emergency, the need may increase to hundreds of officers. In such a
scenario,the IC is still responsible for the accomplishment of all applicable ICS functions.
Clearly, the IC cannot do all the functions alone as in a small incident. So, to spread the
workload into manageable components, the IC appoints individual Officers-in-Charge (OIC) to
oversee specific areas of the ICS to ensure effective task completion.
ICS provides numerous functional elements to assist operational and organizational needs. The
organizational levels and ICS elements activated for any particular incident should be limited to
that necessary to mitigate the emergency. The theory is that form(ICS structure) follows
function(getting the job done). A basic ICS concept is any ICS element that is not staffed is the
functional responsibility of the next higher supervising OIC, or ultimately rests with the IC.
For example, in an incident requiring aircraft coordination, the Operations OIC would be
responsible for that coordinating function in the absence of an Air Operations Branch OIC. In a
smaller incident without an Operations OIC, all functions would be assumed by the IC,
including aircraft coordination. The key to ICS is remembering to focus on the functions and,Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 16
where possible, delegate authority to staff essential functions to distribute the workload. ICS
provides a built-in capability for modular development so that the form or shape of the ICS
organization always meets the functional need.

SOLUTIONS TO COMMON PITFALLS IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
 Use the Critical Incident Response Plan and initiate ICS from the onset of the incident.
 Identify key jurisdictional agencies and collocate –utilizing the principles of Unified
Command.
 Establish common communications channels for all incident personnel.
 Utilizethe most competent people in key roles, regardless of rank, and let them do their job.
 Knowyourrole.
 Keep all non-essential personnel away from the Command Post.
 Control the information flow.
 Assign a scribe as soon as practical.
 Critically re-examine assumptions that are part of the decision-making process.
 Return to normal operations as soon as practical.
TRANSITIONAL STEPS:
Some of the important “transitional” stepsthat are necessary in applying ICS in a field
incident environment include:
 Recognize and anticipate the requirement that organizational elements will be activated and
take the necessary steps to delegate the authority to others.
 Establish incident facilities as needed, strategically located, to support operations.
 Establish the use of common terminology for organizational functional elements, position
titles, facilities and resources.
 Rapidly evolve from providing verbalorders and instructions to the development of a
written Incident Action Plan.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 18
DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ICS AND OTHERDISCIPLINES’ ICS:
The Law Enforcement Incident Command System is essentially identical to the “generic”
SEMS Incident Command System. However, minor modifications have been made to
enhancethe needs of law enforcement. Some of the significant distinctions are:
 The term “Officer-In-Charge” (OIC) is used in the law enforcement model to describe
positions of leadership at the Section, Branch, Group,and Unit levels. Under ICSS, the
emphasis ison identifying an individual in charge of a function rather than confusing rank
designations with position titles that infer specific meanings and expectations within
different organizations (“Chief,” “Director,” or “Manager”). In disciplines other than law
enforcement,the term OIC, also may be referred to as Section Chief, Branch Director,
Group Supervisor, Unit Leader, or Team Leader.
 Traditional FIRESCOPE ICS places the staging function under the Operations Section. The
1999 edition of The Redbookpresented a model in which staging was organized under
Logistics. The committee tasked with producing this edition has returned Staging to
Operations, in accordance with the FIRESCOPE model. There are sizeable California law
enforcement agencies that have a history of successful use of ICS in both configurations.
However, with the need for joint, multi-disciplinary operations and common terminology on
a national scale, California law enforcement has seen the need to present a model ICS
structure that more closely conforms with FIRESCOPE, which is not only the original ICS,
but is also the system used and advocated by many federal agencies,as well as the model for
the National Incident Management System (NIMS).
 An incident commander may choose to establish the staging function under the Logistics
Section, based on the incident and the needs of the agency. Regardless of which model is
used by an agency, it is essential to ensure that officers are properly checked-in, equipped
(particularly with appropriate radio communications) andavailable to be deployed by the
Operations Section. This is accomplished by a mandatory check-in procedure, a
comprehensive resource status function,and a Staging Area Manager. The flexibility of ICS
allows an agency to build an organization that fits a specific incident, utilizing the various
organizational components as needed, within the general framework of ICS.
Staging areas under ICSare locations set up at an incident where resources can be placed while
awaiting assignment; not necessarily ready for immediate deployment.
In some law enforcement agencies, staging areas are managed by the Logistics Section OIC.
Under the traditional FIRESCOPEICS, a staging area is where resources are placed for
deploymentwithin three minutes at the direction of the Operations Chief. In this traditional
configuration, the Staging Area Manager reports to the Operations Section Chief
 The “Incident Scribe” (also referred to as the Command Post Scribe) is a position that may
be activated to assist the Incident Commander.
 The “Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force” is an example of resource typingin
ordering law enforcement mutual aid resources.
 “Personnel” as a resource category in law enforcement emergency operations is singularly
the most crucial and important. Therefore,it is necessary to provide oversight within the
Logistics Section commensurate with the anticipated need for personnel ordering,
coordination and preparation for deployment.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

Note: In traditional or generic ICS, ordering personnel is handled by the Supply Unit.
INTEGRATING ICSWITH OTHERDISCIPLINES:
Today,with the variety of disasters and emergencies,ICS is seldom purely a fire suppression or
law enforcement activity. Rather, it is more likely a mix of fire service, law enforcement, public
works, emergency medical, building and safety, school personnel and a host of other possible
disciplines. SEMS/ICS provides a system that is adaptable by all disciplines.
The inherent requirement to implement SEMS/ICS is the need to facilitate emergencyresponse
among varying disciplines by way of a coordinated management system which successfully
integrates law enforcement with fire service, emergency services, public works,and other
response organizations. When considering an ICS response that is exclusively fire or exclusively
law enforcement, the organization works reasonably well because of the consistent make-up of
the responding organizations.
In many cases the Incident Commander will be from the fire fighting discipline. If law
enforcement is collocated with fire service, it is reasonable to assume that the ICS organization
will reflect the distinctions discussed earlier and will not reflect a purely ICSorganization.
When working within a fire-oriented ICS, officers should be mindful of the differences and
make allowances so that the law enforcement function can perform as expeditiously as possible.
Usually law enforcement participation in a fire-oriented ICS will consist of an Agency
Representative with the authority to commit law enforcement resources, or this individual may
become elevated to Deputy Incident Commanderunder a Unified Command structure. There
also may be other law enforcement personnel assigned to a Law Divisionwith groups assigned
to crowd control, traffic, security, and evacuation functions.
Law enforcement personnel assigned as an Agency Representative or collocated with personnel
from other disciplines should, as necessary, relay mission-tasking requests to the appropriate
law enforcement function (such requests may be directed to a Police or Sheriff’s Department
Operations Center). The circumstances may be reversed if there is a law enforcement Incident
Commander. The ICS organization should be flexible enough to absorb discipline-related
idiosyncrasies without causing delays in emergency response operations.
Flexibility by law enforcement personnel also is required to accommodate members of other
disciplines whose day-to-day activities are not geared to emergency response. Although it is
their responsibility to fit into the ICS environment, any assistance and courtesy shown will ease
tensions and facilitate future cooperation.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 20
Under some conditions,there will be representatives of the federal government participating at
the Incident Command Post. In some cases federal agents will be providing federal resources in
a support mode and in other cases involving terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, or national
security, a federal agency (e.g., FBI) becomes theleadFederal Agency, locals remain the lead
local agency.
Refer to the Glossaryof this guide for formal definitions of “Terrorism” and “Weapons of
Mass Destruction.”
Usually local government provides the first response. If a federal agency becomes involved,
typically there will be policy level discussions to determine jurisdictional imperatives and an
orderly transition of authority,if necessary. If such a transition occurs, levels of continued local
involvement will be clearly communicated. The federal government does respect the SEMS/ICS
system; therefore, state and local agencies will continue to function within that structure.
Should an emergency or incident occur where a local agency would like guidance in
implementing ICS, the Law Enforcement Branch of the California Governor’s Office of
Emergency Services will maintain a roster of personnel who are proficient in the use of ICS
and will respond under mutual aid to provide consultation and make recommendations to
facilitate the use of ICSS principles.
Contact the Law Enforcement Branch Duty officer at(916) 845-8700 or (916) 845-8911
REIMBURSEMENT INFORMATION:
Law Enforcement Mutual Aid (LEMA) is typically provided voluntarily as agreed to statewide
in the California Master Mutual Aid Agreement. The California Emergency Services Act,
Article 11, Sections8615 through 8619,outlines circumstances under which mutual aid
provisions are implemented.
For some incidents, extraordinary emergency or disaster response costs may be incurred.
California Emergency Services Act, Section 8690.6 establishes parameters and provides
financial assistance for LEMA cost recovery when the incident or disaster results in a
Governor's State of Emergency Proclamation.
Although financial assistance may not be available in every case, the California Governor’s
Office of Emergency ServicesLaw Enforcement Branch will respond to inquiries from local
law enforcement to facilitate the reimbursement process. Please contact the Law Enforcement
Branch at (916) 845-8700to obtain reimbursement advice and application documents.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

SECTION III
Law Enforcement Incident Command System:
In 1970, Southern California experienced a fire season of disastrous proportion. In a 13 day
period,16 lives were lost, 772 structures were destroyed and 600,000 acres were burned. The
disaster of Southern California provided the impetus for the subsequent development of the
Incident Command System (ICS).
Following the Southern California fires, the U.S.Forest Service issued a formal Research
Development and Application Charter to design an all risks management system that would
assist firefighting agencies in improving effectiveness and coordination in combating multi-
jurisdictional fires. The system was to provide an effective means to deal with emergencies of
any nature.
The five-year design effort led to a program named FIRESCOPE(Firefighting Resources of
Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies), who’smain product turned out to be
the Incident Command System. The origins of the Incident Command System actually can be
traced back to the Military Re-Organization Act of 1920 that brought the entire United States
military under the G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4 organizational system for the management of our total
military efforts.
Today, ICS forms the basis of the National Incident Management System (NIMS)that has been
mandated under the February 28, 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive –5,
Management of Domestic Incidents. In his September 8, 2004,letter to all the U.S. Governors,
Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge stated: “The 9/11 Commission Report recommended
national adoption of the Incident Command System (ICS) to enhance command, control, and
communications capabilities. All federal, state, territory, tribal, and local jurisdictions will be
required to adopt ICS in order to be compliant with the NIMS. In order to receive fiscal year
2006 preparedness funding, the minimum fiscal year 2005 compliance requirements must be
met.”
Because of our efforts here in California with SEMS, we are significantly ahead of this
requirement. Please see: www.fema.gov/nims. ICS has been tried, proven, and highly refined
since its conception. Its effectiveness as an emergency management system is now mandated
throughout the United States.
The Law Enforcement Incident Command System (ICS)provides a management structure and
system for conducting on-site emergency operations. It is applicable to small-scale daily
operational activities as well as major mobilizations. Because of its standardized operational
structure and common terminology, ICS provides a useful and flexible management system that
is particularly adaptable to incidents involving multi-jurisdictional or multi-discipline
responses.
ICS provides the flexibility needed to rapidly activate and establish an organizational format
around those functions that need to be performed.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 23
ICS OperatingRequirements:
The following are operating requirements of the Incident Command System (ICS):
The system provides for the following types of operations:
 Single jurisdiction responsibility with single agency involvement.
 Single jurisdiction responsibility with multi-agency involvement.
 Multi-jurisdiction responsibility with multi-agency involvement.
The system's organizational structure is able to adapt to any emergency to which public safety
would be expected to respond.
 The system is applicable and acceptable to all user agencies.
 The system is able to expand in a rapid manner from an initial response to a major incident.
It is able to reduce its size just as rapidly as the organizational needs of the situation
decrease.
 The system has common elements in organization terminology and procedure,which allows
maximum application. Implementation of the ICS system should cause the least disruption
to existing systems.
 The system is effective in fulfilling all the above requirements and is simple enough to
insure ease of understanding.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 24
The Law Enforcement Incident Command System (ICS):
Management Concepts:
 Common Terminology
 Modular Organization
 Unified Command Structure
 Action Planning
 Manageable Span of Control
 Pre-designatedIncident Facilities
 Comprehensive Resource Management
 Integrated Communications
 Area Command
Common Terminology:
It is essential for any management system that common terminology be established for the
following components: organizational functions, resources, and facilities.
Organizational Functions:
Refers to a standard set of five major pre-designated functions:
 Command
 Operations
 Planning/Intelligence
 Logistics
 Finance/Administration
Resources:
This refers to the combination of personnel and equipment used in tactical operations.
Facilities:
Refers to common identifiers used for those facilities in and around the incident area, which
will be used during the course of the incident. These facilities include the Command Post,
staging areas, etc.
Modular Organization:
The ICS organizational structure develops in a modular fashion based on the nature, size, and
anticipated duration of an incident. The intent of this modular feature is that at each level:
1) only those functional elements that are required to meet current objectives need to be
activated, and 2) that all elements of the organization can be arranged in various ways within
or under the five SEMS essential functions.
The functions of any non-activated element will be the responsibility of the next highest
element in the organization. Each activated element must have a person in charge of it that is
based on job expertise and qualifications. Rank is not necessarily the sole determinant when
filling ICS positions. It is also possible that one OIC may be in charge of more than one
functional element.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 25
The concept of using this structure within the SEMS Field Response organization is based on
the following:
 Develop the form of the organization to match the function(s) to be performed.
 Fill only those organizational elements that are required.
 Stay within recommended span of control guidelines.
 Perform the function of any non-activated organizational element at the next highest level.
 De-activate elements no longer required by the incident.
The designated organizational elements established for use in the Incident Command System
are listed below. How these are applied in ICS will vary slightly from section to section within
the organization.
 Command
 Section
 Branches
 Divisions or Groups
 Units
 Teams,Task Forces (e.g., Mobile Field Force), single resources or other elements are
defined by agency policy.
Within the ICS the first management assignments will be made by the Incident Commander
and will normally be a Section Officer-In-Charge (OIC). The purpose of the Section OIC is to
manage specific functional areas. Section OICs may delegate further management authority for
their areas as required. If the Section OIC realizes the need, other functional branches may be
added within the section. Similarly, each functional Branch OIC will assign further individual
tasks within the branch as needed.
Most law enforcement operations remain at a level that the organization does not expand. It
remains small in most instances, so only activate what is actually needed!
Unified Command Structure:
Unified Command is a procedure that allows all agencies with significant geographical, legal
or functional responsibility over an incident to avoid operational conflicts, economize
resources by collocating at a single Incident Command Post and communicate their operational
goals and strategies to each other during structured planning meetings.
The value of establishing a single Unified Incident Command Post during the initial response
to a multi-jurisdictional or multi-disciplinary incident cannot be over-emphasized. It is
essential to an effective response.
Unified Command is not a committee process. Rather, it is a cooperative process by which
agencies share their objectives and operational plans in a structured process, thereby
facilitating timely communication of accurate information and avoiding operational conflicts.
Agencies do not relinquish their lawful authority, responsibility or jurisdiction and retain
appropriate accountability.
Ideally, for incidents of long duration, a collective set of incident objectives is established and
an integrated Incident Action Plan is developed.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 26
Unified Command is highly flexible. As the incident changes over time with different
disciplines moving into primary roles;the Unified Command structure and personnel
assignments change to meet the need.
Primary Features of a Unified Command:
 A single unified Incident Command Post.
 An integrated planning process and Incident Action Plan.
 Shared operations, planning, logistical and finance/administration functions.
 Coordinated resource ordering.
 Coordinated information released to the news media, community, and others.
Advantages of a Unified Command:
 One set of objectives is developed for the entire incident.
 A collective approach is used to develop strategies to achieve incident goals.
 Information flow and coordination is improved between all jurisdictions and agencies
involved in the incident.
 All agencies with responsibility for the incident have an understanding of joint priorities
and restrictions.
 No agency's authority or legal requirements will be compromised or neglected.
 Each agency is fully aware of the plans, actions and constraints of all others.
 The combined efforts of all agencies are optimized as they perform their respective
assignments under a single Incident Action Plan.
 Duplicative efforts are reduced or eliminated, thus reducing cost and chances for
frustration and conflict.
Collective goals and strategies on major multi-jurisdictional incidents should be in written
format. The goals and strategies will then guide development of the action plan. Under the
Unified Command structure of ICS,the implementation of the action plan is still accomplished
under the direction of the designated Operations OIC.
The Operations OIC will usually be selected from the agency having the most jurisdictional
involvement. All agencies involved with functional responsibilities in the incident and represented
in the Unified Command structure will agree on the selection and designation of the Operations
OIC. Other jurisdictional agencies may be represented as deputies to the Operations OIC.
Action Planning:
An Action Plan is also referred to as "Incident Action Plan, Consolidated Action Plan, or
Operations Plan."
Every incident requires an action plan. Though not always accomplished in a documented
format for small incidents of short duration, a writtenaction plan should be developed and
implemented when:
 Resources from multiple agencies are used.
 Multiple jurisdictions are involved.
 The incident will require a change in shifts of personnel and/or equipment.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 27
The plan should cover all tactical and support activities. The Incident Commander (or Unified
Command) will establish goals and determine strategies for the incident based upon the
requirements of the jurisdiction. Within the Unified Command,the incident objectives must
adequately reflect the policy needs of participating agencies.
Manageable Span of Control:
Safety factors,as well as sound management principles,will dictate span of control
considerations. The span of control should range from three to seven subordinates with a span
of control of five being established as optimal and acceptable, generally.
The type of incident, nature of tasks to be performed, and safety factors are all important
management considerations in determining OIC/subordinate ratio. The changes that occur
during a rapidly developing situation are another consideration in determining span of control.
Planning for change is essential at such times to avoid indiscriminate resources ordering,which
will directly affect span of control effectiveness.
Pre-Designated Incident Facilities:
Certain facilities and locations should be designated in the pre-emergency phase for use during
emergency events. The determination of these facilities and their locations will be based upon
the requirements of the incident and at the direction of the Incident Commander. The Incident
Commander will cause the activation of these facilities as needed at the outbreak of the
emergency event. These facilities may be used as:
 Staging Areas
 Command Posts
 Mass Care Centers
 Evacuation Centers
Comprehensive Resource Management:
Resources may be organized as either single resources or as task forces (e.g., mobile field
force). Strict accountability is absolutely essential and can be accomplished by:
 Establishing mandatory initial check-in procedures.
 Assigning a current status condition.
 Ensuring all changes to resources, locations and status conditions are reported promptly to
the appropriate functional unit.
Check-In Procedures:
ICSS has a simple and effective check-in process for personnel, supplies, and equipment.
Personnel:Most personnel responding to an incident should report to the Staging Area and
check-in with the StagingManager (or the Check-In Recorder assigned to the Staging Area
from the Personnel Unit, if activated). However, when it is not practical to report directly to the
Staging Area, such as the case when units respond directly to field assignments, then it is the
responsibility of the single units or the appropriate OIC to report (usually via radio) all
checked-in personnel under his/her command to the Personnel Unit in the Logistics Section.
Supplies and Equipment:Most supplies and equipment assigned to an incident should be
delivered to the Staging Area and checked-in with the Staging Area Manager (or the
Receiving/Distribution Officer assigned to the Staging Area from the Supply Unit if activated).
However, when it is not practical to report directly to the Staging Area, such as the case whenLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 28
supplies are delivered directly to field assignments, and then it is the responsibility of the
single units or the appropriate OIC receiving the supplies or equipment to report receipt of
supplies and equipment to the Supply Unit in the Logistics Section.
To summarize, personnelcheck-in with the Personnel Unit (Check-In Recorder) at the Staging
Area and supplies and equipment check-in with the Supply Unit (Receiving/Distribution
Officer). If neither of these positions are activated (or if in doubt), then simply report to the
Staging Area Manager for direction.
ICSForm 211 (Check-In List)isdesigned to assist OICs with recording checked-in personnel,
equipment, and supplies.
Integrated Communications:
Communication systems require advanced planning. This planning should include the
development of frequency inventories,which will support tactical and support resources,
frequency sharing agreements, use of synthesized mobile/portable radio equipment, cellular
phones, and the use of available state and federal communications equipment.
Communications should be established at an incident based communications center.
Note: All radio communications should be transmitted in clear text, agency specific codes
should not be used.
Area Command:
As a part of the general guidance related to the SEMS Field Response, it may be appropriate to
consider the use of Area Command.
In ICS, Area Command is an organization that is established primarily to oversee the
management of multiple incidents that are each being handled by an Incident Command
System organization. An Area Command also may be conducted as a Unified Area Command.
The Purpose of an Area Command is to:
 Set overall priorities within the geographical area covered by the Area Command.
 Determine appropriate strategies for use in achieving the priorities.
 Allocate critical resources based on priorities.
 Ensure that incidents are properly managed.
 Ensure that objectives are met, and strategies followed.
Area Command Reporting Relationships: When Area Command is established, Incident
Commander(s) for the incidents under the authority of the Area Command will report to the
Area Commander. The Area Commander is accountable to his/her agency or jurisdictional
executive or administrator. This could be the DOC, EOC,or another location. Itis important to
note that Area Command is a command function of fieldresponse and not an EOC function.
At a minimum, this would include:
 Collect and review incident action plans for all incidents within the area.
 Coordinate priorities and objectives for all incidents within the established area.
 Ensure communication and coordination between all incident commands within the area.
 Collect, review and coordinate incident communication plans.
 Ensure effective span of control.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 29
 Use common terminology as appropriate to the situation.
 Delegate authority and activate organizational elements within the ICS structure as needed
or anticipated.
 Provide for personnel accountability and a safe environment.
Advantages of Using Area Command:
Much of the inter-incident coordination normally required of each IC will be accomplished at
the Area Command level. Using an Area Command allows the Incident Commanders and their
incident management teams to focus attention on their assigned incident.
Area Command sets priorities between incidents and allocates critical resources according to
priorities established by the Agency Executive.
Area Command helps the agency executive by ensuring that agency policies, priorities,
constraints and guidance are being made known to the respective Incident Commanders.
Area Command also reduces the workload of the agency executive, especially if there are
multiple incidents occurring at the same time.
Requirements in Establishing Area Command:
The following requirements apply to either an Area Command or a Unified Area Command:
Incident Commanders covered by the Area Command must be notified that an Area Command
is being established.
The Area Command team should consist of the best qualified personnel with respect to their
functional areas. The functions of Area Command require personnel that have experience in,
and are qualified to oversee, complex incident situations.
The Area Command organization operates under the same basic principles as does the Incident
Command System.
The Area Command organization should always be kept as small as possible.
Area Command organizational positions could consist of:
 Area Commander and, only as necessary:
 Area Command Logistics OIC (Section Chief)
 Area Command Planning/Intelligence OIC (Section Chief)
 Area Command Critical Resources Unit OIC (Leader)
 Area Command Situation Unit OIC (Leader)
 Area Command Public Information Officer
 Area Command Liaison Officer
It is important to remember that Area Command does not in any way replace the incident level
ICS organizations or functions. The above positions, if established, are strictly related to Area
Command operations. Specific duties and responsibilities will be established by the Area
Commander.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 30
Incident Commanders under the designated Area Commander are responsible to, and should be
considered as part of, the overall Area Command organization. They must be provided
adequate and clear delegation of authority.
An Area Command or Unified Area Command should develop an action plan concerning the
priorities, objectives and needs of the Area Command.
The plan should:
 Clearly state agency policy, objectives, and priorities, including priorities for critical
resource allocations.
 Provide an organization with clear lines of authority and communications.
 Identify specific functions to be performed at the Area Command versus those incidents
such as in the area of public information.
Area Command facilities may be co-locatedat department operations centers, EOCs, or other
locations. It is recommended that they not be established in conjunction with an existing
Incident Command Post (ICP).
A training module dedicated to Area Command is included in the SEMS Field Level course
of instruction.
ICS Position Assignment and Responsibilities:
Command Staff:
The Command Staff consists of the Incident Commander, Deputy Incident Commander, Public
Information Officer, Incident Scribe, Safety Officer (when activated), and Liaison Officer.
See organizationchart on page 47.
Incident Commander (IC):
The Incident Commander is responsible for all incident activities including the development of
strategies and tactics and the ordering of and the release of resources. The Incident
Commander has complete authority and responsibility for the conduct of overall operations.
It is operationally imperative that the Incident Commander delegate authority and assignments to
qualified subordinates. This is best accomplished through "mission tasking." Mission tasking
allows the IC to give direction to subordinate OICs in broad parameters without suppressing
initiative of those responsible for the detailed execution of action plans. The authority of the
Incident Commander is exercised to direct and control the work effort of subordinates and
influence the outcome of the coordinated actions.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Establish incident command post.
 Assess the evolving emergency situation and establish priorities of action.
 Assign necessary staff.
 Activate needed ICS elements and selected Section OICs.
 Conduct initial briefing and begin planning and intelligence process.
 Approve all plans, incident action plan, resources orders, media releases, and the
demobilization plan.
 Ensure coordination of staff actions and activities.
 Manage incident operations through the use of an Operations Section OIC.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 31
Deputy Incident Commander:
In large incidents, the Deputy Incident Commander position may be activated. The Deputy
Incident Commander is the principal assistant to the IC and possesses the qualifications and
authority to act on the IC's behalf in his/her absence. The Deputy Incident Commander receives
duty assignments and staff direction from the IC.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Assume interim command of all operational functions in the absence of the IC.
 Verify task completion by functional areas.
 Appoint agency representatives to outside agencies' EOCs.
 Request liaison personnel from outside agencies involved in the emergency.
 Review and ensure completion of all administrative duties, situation reports, logs, journals,
section activities reports.
 Assist the IC as directed.
Public Information Officer (PIO):
The Public Information Officer, a member of the Command Staff, is the sole person
responsible for the formulation and release of information to the media as directed by the IC. In
the Unified Command, though many agencies represented may have a PIO, a single Public
Information Officer for the Unified Command is appointed. All releases are approved by the
Incident Commander or Unified Command Structure.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Establish an information center separate from all other activities when possible.
 Arrange for work space, materials and staffing.
 Prepare initial information summary and maintain file of all subsequent summaries.
 Obtain IC approval for all press releases.
 Releases approved current information to the media and post the releases atthe incident
command post promptly.
 Arrange meetings between incident personnel and the media.
 Provide media escort services for media and VIPs.
 Observe all constraints on news releases imposed by the IC.
 Maintain a unit log.
Incident Scribe:
The activation of this position is at the discretion of the Incident Commander. The functions of
this position generally are conducted by the Planning/Intelligence Section when activated. At
the direction of the Incident Commander, the Incident Scribe shall record information from all
incident message forms with reference to time, message, and action taken.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Maintain and periodically distribute a situation report.
 Gather incident-related information from other sections for entry into the Command Post
Log.
 Refer newsworthy information to the Public Information Officer.
 Ensure all messages are appropriately routed.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 32
Safety Officer:
The Safety Officer reports directly to the IC. This position is mandatedby CalOSHA for all
hazardous materials incidents. For other incidents,when activated, the Safety Officer is
responsible for monitoring and assessing hazardous and unsafe situations and developing
measures for assuring personnel safety. The Safety Officer has the authority to stop all unsafe
activity on an incident that is deemed to be outside the scope of the incident action plan.
At major disasters or at particularly traumatic events, the Safety Officer typically coordinates
the response and deployment of Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) personnel. It
should be noted that CISM is a professional psychological function and should not be
attempted at a layperson level without professional guidance. Nevertheless, CISM is an
important health issue for response personnel and planning efforts should include provisions
for its implementation.
Liaison Officer:
The Liaison Officer is a member of the Command Staff and is the point of contact for assisting
agency representatives. This may include representatives from other law enforcement agencies,
fire services, emergency medical providers, Red Cross, Public Works, Coroner's Office, Health
Services, etc. The Liaison Officer will be from the agency having jurisdictional responsibility
for the emergency.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Obtain a briefing from the Incident Commander.
 Provide a point of contact for assisting mutual aid agency representatives.
 Identify agency representatives from each agency including the Communications link and
their location.
 Respond to requests from incident personnel for their inter-organizationalcontacts.
 Monitor the incident operations to identify what might be potential inter-organizational
problems.
 Provide information and maintain a liaison with other Government and Law Enforcement
agencies.
 Maintain a unit log.
Agency Representatives:
An individual is assigned from an assisting agency that has the delegated authority to make
decisions affecting that agency's participation in emergency operations. Upon arriving at the
designated staging area,the Agency Representative reports to the Liaison Officer. Each
responding agency should assign only one representative to the incident.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Ensure that all agency resources have checked-in.
 Obtain situation briefing from the Liaison Officer.
 Establish a working location and notifyagency personnel that the Agency Representative
position has been filled.
 Attend planning meetings as required.
 Provide input regarding the use of agency resources.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 33
Operations Section:
The Operations Section holds the responsibility for the coordinated tactical response of the
incident. This may include, but is not limited to, the deployment of personnel in response to a
civil disorder, coordinated response to an evacuation, support of fire services, coordinated
response to rescue operations, etc.
Operations Section OIC:
The Operations Officer, also identified as the Operations Officer-In-Charge (OIC), is
responsible for the implementation and management of all operational plans and supervises the
Operations Section. The Operations Section OIC activates and supervises the organizational
elements of the response in accordance with the Incident Action Plan and directs its
implementation. The Operations Section OIC also coordinates unit tactics with other staff
members, requests or releases resources, makes situational changes to the plan as necessary
and reports such changes to the Incident Commander.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Obtain a briefing from the IC.
 Exercise direction and control over on-going operational activities in accordance with the
incident action plan.
 Supervise and direct section personnel.

check-in accounting and to secure proper support for food, lodging, supplies, etc.
 Advise the IC on all developments and changes in the tactical situation.
 Maintain a unit log.
Operations Dispatcher:
The Operations Dispatcher functions under the control of the Operations OIC. The dispatcher
manages and controls all tactical radio and data frequencies used in support of the emergency
incident. In major disasters or complex emergency events, a supervising dispatcher may be
activated.
Duties and responsibilities:
 Dispatch field units as directed by the Operations OIC.
 Maintain unit designation board depicting status and availability of field operations staff.
 Coordinate activities of the unit and with other agency dispatchers.
 Maintain a unit log.
Branch:
The Branch OIC functions within the Operations Section. The Operations Section OIC will
assign specific portions of the incident action plan to the Branch OIC for implementation. The
Branch OIC retains authority and control of resources assigned to accomplish tasks. Routine
status on conditions and progress are provided to the Operations OIC.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 34
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Review assignments with subordinate staff and modify where appropriate.
 Attend planning meetings when requested.
 Assign specific tasks to mission group OICs.
 Provide timely information to the Field Operations OIC on situation changes, rescues,
plans modifications and hazards.
 Maintain a unit log.
Group/Division:
The Group (or Division) OIC functions within the Operations Section. "Groups" are activated
upon identified need in the incident action plan for a specific function(i.e., Perimeter Control
Group, Security Group, Traffic Control Group, and Evacuation Group). "Divisions" are
activated to coordinate operations in a specific geographicarea.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Implementation of assigned portions of the action plan.
 Task assignments within the group or division.
 Progress and situation reports to the Branch OIC or the Operations Section OIC.
 Maintain a unit log.
Mobile Field Force:
The Mobile Field Force is a type of specialized "Task Force." It is similar to the concept of a
"Strike Team" in the fire service. The Mobile Field Force OIC functions within the Operations
Section. When activated it is responsible for specific tactical assignments. Assignments may
include: traffic/crowd control, site evacuations and security; reports progress on mission
assignments to the next higher OIC level.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Reviews assignment with subordinates.
 Makes essential changes to plans.
 Coordinates with adjacent task forces and units.
 Reports situation and resources status to next higher level.
 Maintains a unit log.
Staging Officer:
The Staging Officer, also referred to as the Staging Area Manager, under the direction of the
Operations OIC is responsible for maintaining a location where personnel and equipment can
be staged to support an incident.
Duties and Responsibilities:
 Obtain a briefing from the Operations OIC.
 Establish a staging area layout.
 Determine any support needs for equipment, feeding, sanitation and security.
 Coordinate with the Personnel Unit (Check-In Recorder) and the Supply Unit
(Receiving/Distribution Officer) so that arriving resources (personnel, supplies, and
equipment) can easily find the check-in and stand-by locations. If these positions are not
staffed, then the Staging Officer is responsible for the check-in process at the Staging Area
and making resource status reports to the Resources Unit.
 Request maintenance service for equipment at the staging area as appropriate.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 35
 Arrange for storage facilities for impounded vehicles.
 Supervise the parking and safeguarding of law enforcement personnel's private vehicles,
which may be parked at or near the staging area.

 Ensure a clean up of the staging area.
 Assess any damage to the staging area property/facilities.
 Remove all equipment and supplies from within the staging area.
 Maintain a unit log.
Air Operations Branch:
Decision to Activate: The Air Operations Branch may be activated whenever aircraft are
deployed on an incident requiring mission assignment coordination, establishment of helispots
or a helibase, or to address any aviation safety concerns requiring full time attention. Only
persons knowledgeable in aircraft operations and aviation procedures should be assigned to
the leadership positions within the Air Operations Branch. Refer to "Air Operations Checklist"
in the Annex Section of this guide.
The Air Operations Branch OIC reports to the Operations Section OIC. The Air Operations
Branch OIC, who is ground based, is primarily responsible for input to the air operations
portion ofthe Incident Action Plan. The plan will reflect agency restrictions that have an
impact on the operational capability or utilization of resources (e.g., night flying, hours per
pilot). After the plan is approved, the Air Operations Branch is responsible for implementing
its strategic aspects -those that relate to the overall strategy as opposed to those that pertain to
tactical operations. Specific tactical activities are normally performed by the Air Mission
Group OIC working with ground and air resources. Additionally, the Air Operations Branch
OIC is responsible for providing logistical support to aircraft operation on the incident.
Air Mission Group:
The Air Mission Group OIC is primarily responsible for the coordination of aircraft operations
when fixed and/or rotary-wing aircraft are operating on an incident. The Air Mission Group
OIC reports to the Air Operations Branch OIC.
Aviation Support Group:
The Aviation Support Group OIC is primarily responsible for supporting and managing
helibase and helispot operations and maintaining liaison with fixed-wing air bases. This
includes providing (1) fuel and other supplies, (2) maintenance and repair of aircraft, (3)
keeping records of aircraft activity, and (4) providing enforcement of safety regulations.
Helicopters during landing and take-off and while on the ground are under the control of the
Aviation Support Group's Helibase or Helispot Managers. The Aviation Support Group OIC
reports to the Air Operations Branch OIC.
Planning/Intelligence Section:
ThePlanning/Intelligence Section collects, evaluates, processes, and disseminates information
for use at the incident. Additionally, the Planning/Intelligence Section reviews and develops
incident intelligence information to assist in development of contingency plans for the Incident
Commander. The section also prepares briefings for the Incident Commander and the
Emergency Operations Center's staff related to new or updated intelligence information.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

enforcement resources from within the Operational Area. This includes the response of law
enforcement resources from unaffected municipalities, local CHP and other state agencies, as
well as his/her own resources, to assist the affected chief of police.
Regional Mutual Aid
Should the emergency situation be of such magnitude as to requireresources of more than one
Operational Area, the Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator will request
resources from other Operational Areas within the region.
Statewide Mutual Aid
If the combined resources of a region are insufficient to cope with the emergency situation, the
Regional Coordinator may request additional assistance through the State Law Enforcement
Mutual Aid Coordinator. Assistance from regions statewide will then be mobilized.
Day-to-Day Mutual Aid
During the course of normal, everyday law enforcement, smaller incidents occur that may
require immediate assistance from adjoining or nearby agencies. Officers from nearby
jurisdictions may respond to emergency broadcasts on their own initiative (departmental policy
permitting) without a formal mutual aid request.
Planned Events
Planned or permitted events are not mutual aid incidents for planning purposes. As a matter of
responsible planning, the event planners should meet with local law enforcement to ensure the
public safety is protected. Policing costs are frequently recovered through event revenues and
this should be considered during the planning process. The mutual aid system is not intended to
providereimbursement to various law enforcement agencies that may provide services under
contract.
Even with adequate planning, an unforeseen emergency may occur at a planned event that
results in a mutual aid response.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 56
Fifty Percent Guideline
No jurisdiction is required to unnecessarily deplete itsown personnel, equipment and service
capabilities to furnish mutual aid resources. When requested to provide mutual aid, it is
generally accepted that a reasonable response will consist of up to 50% of available on-duty
uniformed personnel.
Mission Numbers
When mutual aid resources are assigned from beyond the boundaries of the requesting
Operational Area,the Law Enforcement Branch of the California Governor’s Office of
Emergency Serviceswill issue a Mission Number to track resource movement. Mission
Numbers do not assure reimbursement of response costs; they track and document the mutual
aid response.
Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force, Defined
Emergency operations’ planning isbest achieved in advance, anticipating needs that mayarise
during emergencies. One of the tools that haveproven successful is the formation of the Mutual
Aid Response Mobile Field Force. A Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is a regionally-
organized, trained and equipped group of officers and supervisors, from a coalition of
independent agencies that may be deployed,as needed,to mitigate potential or real problems.
Development
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force concept has been developed to provide an
efficient and effective method for assembling and deploying a platoon-size, tactical force for
mutual aid missions within the state of California. Similar to the development of the fire
service's concept of a Strike Team, the Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is a specified
combination of single resources assembled for a particular tactical need, with common
communications and a leader.
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force concept is based upon the initial work of several
law enforcement agencies within California. In 1993, considerable effort toward improving the
Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Response Plan was undertaken. The recommendation of the plan
was that municipal law enforcement agencies within specified geographical areas form mutual
aid response mobile field forces for law enforcement mutual aid situations affecting areasboth
within and outside the impacted jurisdiction.
As a result of that suggestion, consensuswas reached to commit participating departments' staff
resources to develop the concept ofand proposalfor multi-agency Mobile Field Forces(MFF).
This law enforcement emergency response coalition formally established the joint-agency
Mobile Field Force configuration, protocols, and standards. Since its inception, mobile field
forces have been deployed successfully on numerous major incidents.
In 1997, the SEMS Law Enforcement Specialist Committee, under the guidance of the
CaliforniaGovernor’s Office of EmergencyServices, refined and adopted the Mobile Field
Force concept for statewide application. The operating, administrative, and fiscal guidelines
presented in this text areprovided as the recommended State guidance for the formation and
operation of a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 57
Operating Guidelines
Call-Outs/Activation:
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force should be made available for response pursuant
to mutual aid agreements in the event of a natural disaster, civil unrest, or other major incidents,
when:
All available resources in the affected jurisdiction have been reasonablydepleted; and,
The normal delivery of police services has been significantly disrupted.
Utilizing the law enforcement mutual aid system, the request should be made to the Mobile
Field Force OIC who should have the rank and commensurate authority to activate the Mobile
Field Force.
Responses to regions outside the area of contributing agencies should be coordinated by the
regional mutual aid coordinator identified by the California Governor’s Office of Emergency
Services.
Member agency participation in the Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is a cooperative
agreement and is not bound by any contractual considerations.
Activation Protocol:
In the event of a Mobile Field Force activation request, contact should be made in the following
order:
Notification to the Operational Area Mutual Aid Coordinator.
Concerned agency Incident Commander, or Department Executive, who will notify their agency
Mobile Field Force commander.
 The Mobile Field Force OIC will contact the Watch Commander at each of the participating
agencies and advise of the Mobile Field Force activation. The Watch Commander should be
advised of the assembly point for the Mobile Field Force, the expected duration of the
activation, and any other pertinent information.
 The Watch Commander of every participating agency will contact and provide the agreed
number of personnel. Efforts should be made to assign personnel who have trained with the
Mobile Field Force. If that is not possible, the Watch Commander will assign other
personnel to meet that agency commitment.
After Action Reports:
After Action Reports should be completed by the Mobile Field Force OIC and forwarded to the
Incident Commander as soon as possible following an event for which the Mobile Field Force
was activated. After action reports,should be forwarded to the Chief Executive Officer of the
contributing agencyand the Regional Mutual Aid Coordinator. The contents of the After Action
Report willtypically include:
 Synopsis of Events
 Personnel Deployed and Hours Worked
 Arrests (if any)
 Expenditures/Reimbursements
 Significant Problems Encountered
 Recommendations for ImprovementsLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 58
Communications:
Some member agencies may not have compatible radio frequencies. A workable
communicationsplan will be necessary at the time of the formation of the Mutual Aid Response
Mobile Field Force. Common communication ability is essential to the tactical success of a
Mobile Field Force.
Mobile Field Force Kits:
Pursuant to the Mobile Field Force Concept, participating agencies should collectively assemble
mobile field force kits,which will be basic to all responses. The kits will contain sufficient and
appropriate equipment for each Mobile Field Force. Mobile Field Force OICs will facilitate the
assembly and warehousing of the field force kits. See the standardized equipment lists in this
section.
Training:
Appropriate training is crucial to the maintenance of an effective Mobile Field Force. Training
should be provided prior to activation of the Mobile Field Force and should be conducted on a
regular and frequent basis.
Every effort should be made to schedule training in conjunction with the normal working hours
of personnel assigned to the Mobile Field Force. This training can be POST certified.
Administrative Guidelines
Use of Force:
Individual officers are bound by use of force policies of their employing agency. However, use
of less-lethal devices(e.g., chemical agents, Tasers, ARWEN, Sting balls, or Stun bags)should
be used decisively when the situation dictates.
Firearms:
Every officer assigned to a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force shall carry a firearm in
accordance with their employing agency’s policies and procedures. Minimum departmental
standards for qualification must be met.
Officer-Involved Shootings:
The investigation of officer-involved shootings should be the primary responsibility of the
jurisdiction in which the incident occurred. Appropriate staff personnel from the involved
officer(s) department may assist or conduct cooperative independent and/or joint investigations.
On-Duty Motor Vehicle Accidents:
If an officer assigned to a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is involved in a traffic
collision while on duty, a detailed report will be completed by the jurisdictional agency. Copies
will be forwarded to the officer's agency and the Mobile Field Force OIC for further review and
necessary action.
Injuries Sustained On-Duty:
When an officer assigned to a Mutual Aid Mobile Field Force is injured on duty, the respective
agency policy for on-duty injuries should be followed. To expedite immediate medical
attention, every officer assigned to a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force should supply
his/herMobile Field Force OIC with a packet containing the applicable forms and processing
instructions.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 59
Citizen Complaints:
Any complaint from an individual alleging misconduct by personnel assigned to a Mutual Aid
Response Mobile Field Force will be directed to the Mobile Field Force OIC for immediate
assignment and investigation. All complaints will be reviewed by the Mobile Field Force OIC.
The Mobile Field Force OIC should immediately notify the involved officer's respective agency
andfacilitate any subsequent investigation thoroughly.
It should be the policy of the Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Forces to receive, record, and
properly investigate all citizen complaints against assigned personnel without exception. All
findings should be forwarded to the involved officer’s respective agency head.
Fiscal Guidelines
Payroll:
All officers, when assigned to a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force, will be paid by their
respective agency. It is the responsibility of the Mobile Field Force OIC to ensure that personnel
record keeping has been coordinated with the Logistics Section (Personnel Branch) and the
Finance/Administration Section (Time Unit).
Illness:
If an officer becomes ill while assigned to a Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force, sick time
will be utilized in accordance with the respective agency’s policy and procedure. Reporting of
sick time will be made to the Mobile Field Force OIC who will notify the involved officer's
agency.
Overtime:
If necessary,all overtime beyond normal shift hours should be approved in advance by the
Mobile Field Force OIC. All assigned personnel should respond to call-outs as deemed
necessary by the Mobile Field Force OIC.
Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force Organization
Configuration (State Standard):
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force (Platoon) consists of four12-person squads, with
an OIC (minimum rank of Lieutenant) and Deputy OIC (minimum rank of Sergeant), each with
a driver. The minimum total personnel are 52.
Rarely can one department staff an entire Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force. Most often,
the Mobile Field Force will consist of a coalition of personnel from several law enforcement
agencies within an operational area.
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force can be augmented with additional personnel,
vehicles, or equipment depending on the mission.
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force configuration described here is considered to be
the State standard for mutual aid ordering purposes. This configuration has been established to
create a reference or "baseline" standard for ordering, providing, and/or receiving law
enforcement personnel in a mutual aid situation.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 60
Although law enforcement agencies are not required to configure or define their daily
operations utilizing the State standard configuration, it is recommended that agencies use the
agreed upon standard terminology and organizational structure for requesting or providing
mutual aid. Any deviation from the established standards should be identified at the time of
ordering so as to facilitate efficient planning, logistical support, and deployment of resources.
For example, if a jurisdiction needs a Mobile Field Force for civil unrest purposes, the
requesting agency needs to identify that purpose at the time of ordering. This will help to ensure
that the Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is properly configured, and brings with it
appropriate resources such as prisoner vans, counter-snipers, and less-lethal munitions.
In another instance, a requesting jurisdiction may need a Mobile Field Force for perimeter and
traffic control around a huge wildland fire. In this case, it would be more advantageous to have
two officers per vehicle in order to cover the largest possible area. Since the standard
configuration is four officers per vehicle, the requesting agency should identify the need for
deviation in the standard configuration at time of the initial request.
By establishing a standard Mobile Field Force configuration, ICSoverhead teams can accurately
plan for deploy, and support the logistical needs of mutual aid resources (i.e., how many people
to feed and how many vehicles to stage and fuel).
Mobile Field Force Capability:
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force can be configured for a variety of mutual aid
response needs, including civil unrest and large scale natural or human-caused disasters.
The Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force is capable of performing the following functions:
• Provide 12 4-person mobile patrols within an assigned area of responsibility.
• Provide approximately 20 traffic control posts.
• Provide approximately 12 roadblocks under civil disturbance conditions.
• Provide security for critical facilities.
• Provide 4 squad-sized crowd control elements with the ability to deploychemical agents
while not maintaining security of its own vehicles.
• Provide 3 squad-sized crowd control elements with the ability to deploy chemical agents
while maintaining security of its own vehicles.
• Civil disturbance control.
• Limited first-aid capability.
• If implemented, mass arrest capability.
• If implemented, limited counter-sniper capability.
In orderto be fully effective in civil disturbance operations, a Mobile Field Force may be
augmented with two prisoner transportation vans. A male/female deputy/officer team assigned
to each van would be beneficial forprisoner search and transportation.
NOTE: The Incident Commander should describe the Mobile Field Force's intended mission at
the time it is requested, so that appropriate logistical support may be supplied at the time of
deployment.
Personnel Commitment:
The personnel commitment from contributing agencies will need to be agreed upon in advance
of the formation of the Mobile Field Force.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 61
Duration of Deployment:
Duration of initial deployment may vary. Typically during extended operations, 12-hour shifts
(on-station)would be implemented. Therefore, travel time should be taken into account in all
cases. Mental and physical fatigueis a critical factor and should be considered by the Incident
Commander when developing deployment schedules.

The following section describes the duties and responsibilities of each member as well as the
standard configuration of the Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force.
StandardMobile Field Force Personnel:
The Mobile Field Force normally is led by a Lieutenant (OIC). The second in command is the
Mobile Field Force Sergeant (Deputy OIC). Normally the Mobile Field Force consists of four
(12-person) squads, each commanded by a Squad Sergeant, and specified support personnel.
This configuration can be modified by the Incident Commander to meet specific requirements
of the situation. The standard State Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force will normally
consist of 52 personnel, in a total of 14 patrol vehicles (general purpose), organized as follows:
Mobile Field Force OIC (Lieutenant) -Commands the Mobile Field Force in the field. Once
given a mission, the OICestablishes the method to accomplish the mission. In developing the
plan, the OIC must remain within the policies established by the Incident Commander's Incident
Action Plan.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 62
Mobile Field Force Deputy OIC (Sergeant) -Is usually delegated the responsibility of
equipment issuance and recovery by the Mobile Field Force OIC. For maximum personnel
control, two squads can be assigned to the Mobile Field Force OIC and two squads can be
assigned to the Mobile Field Force Deputy OIC.
Squad Sergeants-Acting under the direction of the Mobile Field Force OIC, the Squad
Sergeant is responsible for the supervision of the 11 deputies/officers in thesquad. The Sergeant
should be assisted by two experienced deputies/officers as Car Commanders.
Car Commanders-The Squad Sergeant should select an experienced officer/deputy to act as
Car Commander for the other two cars in thesquad. The Car Commander assists the Squad
Sergeant in the direction of the squad.
Officers/Deputies-Perform line functions as directed by their Squad Sergeants or Car
Commanders.
Linebackers-Each squad should have two trained deputies/officers whowill give the squads
the ability to deploy less-lethal devices and chemical agents. In squad formation, these
deputies/officers should normally fill the position of linebackers and be equipped to deploy such
devices and agents.
OptionalMobile Field Force Personnel:
The following personnel can be added to a Mobile Field Force based on mission requirements:
Video Camera-Two individuals should be trained and equipped with video camera
capabilities. Although this is an optional position, it is highly recommended that this position
be staffed.
Counter-Sniper -Staffing of this function is discretionary based uponagency policy
concerning counter-sniper tactics. Two officer/deputy personnel should be trained in the use of
an appropriate shoulder weapon (rifle). It is recommended that one officer/deputy be assigned to
the Mobile Field Force OIC and the second officer/deputy be assigned to the Mobile Field Force
Deputy OIC. Deployment of the rifles should be a specific responsibility of the Mobile Field
Force OIC. The counter-sniper's purpose is to provide longer range fire capability for sniper
situations, pending the arrival of a Special Weapons Team.
Prisoner Transportation Team-Two vans with two deputies/officers each. A male/female
officer/deputy teamassigned to each van would facilitate prisoner search and transportation.
Mutual Aid Response Mobile Field Force MemberEquipment
Each member of the Mobile Field Force should be equipped as follows:
 Department Authorized Handgun and Ammunition
 Complete Field Officer Equipment Belt (Sam Browne)
 Helmet with Face Shield
 Baton or Approved Impact Weapon

MUTUAL AID ESSENTIALS
Guidelines for RequestingMutual Aid:
 Identify numbers and types of mutual aid resources to be requested.
 Identify specific missions for mutual aid responder tasking.
 Advise responders what equipment they should bring.
 Establish an assembly area for responding resources.
 Identify communications channels compatible with command and control of field resources.
 Designate a liaison officer to facilitate a coordinated assimilation of responding mutual aid
resources.
 Prepare a situation briefing for responders, including maps as appropriate.
 Provide logistical support such as food, lodging, rest intervals,and equipment maintenance
as appropriate, formutual aid personnel.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 65
Guidelines for ReceivingMutual Aid:
 Properly equip responding personnel.
 Assign a supervisor whenever possible to maintain unit integrity.
 Complete response rosters.
 Dispatch personnel to the staging area.
 Provide relief for assigned personnel at protracted events.
 Maintain records of arrival and departure times, rank, timekeeping, mileage, damage or
injury, and expended resources of those responding.

To better deal with and react to organized civil disobedience groups, the standard 12
person squad may be supplemented with four additional personnel. The four additional
officers will take the positions of “Gas Officer”, “Less Lethal” and two “Spotters”. This
frees the linebackers to properly support the skirmish line and perform “Arrest/Rescue”
missions.

SECTION V
INCIDENT ACTION PLAN(OPERATIONS PLAN):
The Incident Action Plan (IAP) may also be referred to as an "Action Plan" or "Consolidated
Action Plan." The Incident Action Plan developed at the field response level contains
objectives reflecting the overall incident strategy, and specific tactical actions and supporting
information for the next operational period. The plan may be verbal or written.
It is important that all incidents have some form of Incident Action Plan. The plan is developed
around a time period called an "Operational Period." It sets forth the objectives to be achieved
and describes the strategy, tactics, resources and other support necessary to achieve the
objectives within the designated operational period.
Incident Action Plans will vary in content and form depending upon the nature and size of the
incident. ICS provides for the use of a systematic planning process and provides forms as well
as formats for developing the Incident Action Plan (see ICSForms).
A small incident doesnot require an elaborate Incident Action Plan. Most short-term, single-
agency incidents do not require written Action Plans. Listed below are general guidelines for
determining when written plans should be developed:
 Two or more jurisdictions are involved.
 The incident continues into another Operational Period.
 A number of organizational elements have been activated.
 Written plans are required by agency policy.
For incidents operating under a Unified Command, the Incident Action Plan should be written.
This provides all agencies with a clear set of objectives, actions and assignments, and ensures a
unified focus of effort. SEMS requires that agencies operating under a Unified Command,
develop and implement a singular common Incident Action Plan.
INCIDENT ACTION PLANNING ANDOPERATIONS PLANNING:
It is important to define the relationship between these two processes to ensure uniformity and
inter-agency coordination,particularly in events or incidents involving multiple agencies and
disciplines.
It is common for law enforcement agencies to planfor scheduled events or anticipated
incidents. Such events could be annual parades, sporting events, concerts or festivals.
Operations planning can also occur based on intelligence reports thatindicate a strong
likelihood that an incident will take place such as a demonstration or civil unrest.
Although the most common use of Operations Plans are for known or anticipated events or
incidents, they also may be developed during an incident response. For this to occur, the
Incident Commander must understand thoroughly the agency's priorities and overall objectives
for the incident. This information should be obtained from the current Incident Action Plan.
An "agency specific" Operations Plan is particularly valuable in Unified Command incidents,
where multiple agencies are operating under a single Incident Action Plan. The Operations Plan
can focus on policies and procedures specific to individual agencies responsible for a designated
mission or objective(s).Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 69
It is important to note that fully developed Incident Action Plans are used by many agencies as
an "Operations Plan." In these instances,a separate Operations Planning document is not
necessary. Incident Action Plans,which follow SEMS guidance,may include the following
planning areas:
• Overall Objectives andPriorities
• Incident Objectives
• Organization Chart
• Assignment Lists
• Resources Plan
• Communications Plan
• Medical Plan
• Facilities Traffic Plan
• Safety Plan
• Demobilization Plan
Note:The contents of the Action Plan will vary based on the scope of the incident.
These specific areas provide direction and guidance for the command and supervisory structure
and their corresponding field units. It is important to note that ICSForms should be used, as
required, for the completion of the Incident Action Plan.
Overall Objectives: These are initial operational objectives, which can either be established by
agency executives and implemented by the Incident Commander, or established and
implemented on-scene by the Incident Commander. Typically they are broad in scope and based
on early situation reports emanating from the incident. An example of an overall objective for
law enforcement could be, "To ensure the safety and security of the affected population." USE
ICSFORM 202
Incident Objectives: Incident objectives are more specific in nature and are intended to provide
tasking for individual field units. Incident objectives are outcomes of Action Planning Meetings
held on-scene. Action Planning Meetings are convened by the Incident Commander who provides
the command structure with the overall objective for the incident and then identifies and assigns,
in conjunction with the command structure, specific incident objectives to appropriate field units.
Action Planning Meetings can take place at established ICPs or initially around a patrol vehicle
on-scene. Meetings should be brief and concise. An example of an incident objective could be,
"To evacuate all residents in Sector #3 within 5 blocks of the river before 6PM today." Another
example might be, "To set up and maintain security checkpoints along River Drive at Elm, Maple,
and Spruce Avenues until 6PM tomorrow." USE ICSFORM 202
Organization Chart: If the Action Plan is written, it should include an Organization Chart,which
identifies the Incident Command elements activated for the incident or event. It is traditionally
structured hierarchically and includes the Incident Commander, Command Staff, General Staff
sections, and activated branches, groups, task forces, or units. USE ICSFORM 207
Assignment Lists: Field assignment lists may be developed initially by the Incident
Commander, Section OICs or Group/Unit OICs. They are lists of personnel assigned to specific
positions within the Incident Command. Assignment lists may also be developed to identify
branch personnel tactically deployed at specific sites. Once developed, all assignment lists
should be maintained by the Personnel Branch in Logistics. USE ICSFORM 204Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 70
Resources Plan: A brief description of resources required to perform each Incident Objective. The
Resources Plan may also include details on staging area locations, resources staged and status of key
resources ordered. The Resources Plan is prepared by the Logistics Section in close coordination with
the Operations Section OIC, Branch OICs and Mobile Field Force OICs. USE ICSFORM 215
Communications Plan: Briefly describes logistical procedures for issuance, use, maintenance, and
check-in of communications equipment. It also lists primary and secondary or tactical frequencies
to be used. This plan is usually developed by the Communications Unit in Logistics andis included
in the operations briefing for incident personnel prior to deployment. USE ICSFORM 204
Medical Plan: Briefly describes procedures for first aid or other medical treatment for
personnel assigned to the incident in the event of injury or illness. This plan is usually
developed by the Medical Unit in Logistics. These procedures are included in the operations
briefing for incident personnel prior to deployment. USE ICSFORM 201
Facilities Traffic Plan: Briefly describes traffic patterns in and out of the Incident Command
Post. Patterns must be based on the physical layout of facilities in and around the ICP. This plan
also must consider traffic patterns for staging if the Staging Area is collocated with the ICP.
Usually this plan is developed by the Facilities Unit in the Logistics Section. It is included in the
operations briefing for incident personnel prior to deployment. NO SPECIFIC FORM -Attach
Facilities Traffic Plan to ICSFORM 202
Safety Plan: A brief updateon existing or potential safety hazards associated with the incident.
The Safety Plan focuses on reducing hazards through the use of proper procedures and
encourages supervisors to be vigilant in detecting and correcting unsafe conditions. In most
incidents a Safety Officer prepares the Safety Plan with the approval of the Incident
Commander and ensures that pertinent information is included in operations briefings for
incident personnel. In some law enforcement incidents, the Safety Functionmay be assigned to
an Operations or Logistics OIC. While it is recognized that most law enforcement field
operations may be hazardous in nature, the safety function can reduce unsafe conditions through
the use of proper procedures and awareness. NO SPECIFIC FORM -Attach Safety Plan to ICS
FORM 202
Demobilization Plan: Outlines the specific procedures for demobilization of incident
personnel. The Demobilization Plan is prepared by the Demobilization Unit assigned to
Planning/Intelligence. Close coordination is required with Operations and Logistics to
determine current and projected staffing needs as the incident progresses. Timing is a critical
part of the demobilization process. NO SPECIFIC FORM
ELEMENTS OF A COMPLETED WRITTEN INCIDENT ACTION PLAN
A completed written Incident Action Plan typically consists of the following:
• ICSFORM 202 "Incident Objectives"
• ICSFORM 203 "Organization Assignments"
• ICSFORM 204 "Division/Unit Assignments"
• Support Material such as:
o Maps
o Communications Plan
o Medical Plan
o Traffic Plan

Page 71
COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS PLANS
As previously indicated, law enforcement agencies may desire to utilize operations plansthat
are more "specific" to internal policies and procedures. In these situations,it is important that
operations plans are based on common action planning objectives, thus ensuring consistency
and coordination between all agencies and disciplines involved in the response.
While there are several acceptable formats for developing agency-specific operation plans, this
guide illustrates one model presently in use by some agencies. This format utilizes the "five-
paragraph" concept described as follows:
Situation:
Providea brief description of the situation. Describe the incident or event thatrequires
intervention. Include any aggravating or mitigating factors. Describe the organization of
supporting agencies, both law enforcement and others,involved in the operation.
This component should be a brief overview of the circumstances. If more detailed information is
desired it should be included in a separate annex,usually an "Intelligence Annex.”
Generally, this paragraph establishes the Who, What, Where, When and Why of the problem. A
clearly articulated situation paragraph is critical to the development of the rest of the plan, and
essential to provide situation briefings to the executives who are responsible for determining the
posture of the organization relative to the event.
Mission:
The mission is determined by the Incident Commander after receiving a situation briefing. The
statement should define clearly the goal of the department in as concise a manner as possible. If
there is more than one mission involved, there must be a priority established and stated.
The most effective mission statements do not involve a significant departure from normal
department operational concepts. The mission statement is critical because it provides the
foundation and focus for all subsequent planning.
Concept of Operations:
This paragraph is best described as the written intent of the Incident Commander relative to the
conduct of the operation. It is best when it projects the event in chronological order from the
briefing through critique and demobilization. Specific mission assignments are not made in this
paragraph. For example, the establishment of traffic control posts must be discussed;however,
the unit assigned to staff those posts is not designated here.
The following topics are critical to the operation and demand full explanation in this section:
 Arrest Policy

Execution:
This paragraph is used to make specific assignments to all units involved in the operation. Each
element must be identified and assigned a specific mission in the operation. Failure to make
these assignments leads to confusion and can often mean that an element is not committed at a
critical time, causingthe entire mission to fail.
A subparagraph entitled “Coordinating Instructions” may be included if any areas requiring
coordination are needed. Examples may include instructions for communications orbriefings
and assignments for supporting and/or mutual aid units.
The execution paragraph is often a complex and difficulttask. The planner must ensure that
there is no duplication of assignments,no conflicting assignments, and still ensure that all
essential tasks are completed.
The figure above is an example of an event matrix that has proven effective in the completion of
the execution paragraph. It is used in addition to the written instructions and provides a quick
reference to assignments and serves as a check to ensure that there is no duplication of effort in
the execution phase.
Completing the matrix is fairly simple, with significant events related to the operation being
listed in chronological order across the top boxes (one event per box) and the involved units
listed in the boxes along the left side of the matrix. A note is made in the intersecting boxes as
events are assigned to units (refer to example). This note may be a timeor simply a check mark
if the event is not time-critical. Each row and column must have some notation upon completion
of the matrix, or is left blank if an event has not been assigned, or a unit has no assignment.
During the conduct of operations, questions arise relating to events or assignments for units.
Rather than having to find the answers in the narrative portion of the plan,the Incident
Commander, or his designee, may use the matrix to find the answer.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 73
Administrative Instructions:
This paragraph addresses any administrative announcements that are necessary to make the
operation work. For large operations, a separate logistics annex or plan may be produced.
However,for smaller operations logistics questions are addressed within this paragraph.
The following topics are typical to this paragraph:
• Reporting Instructions
• Uniform Requirements
• Timekeeping/Fiscal Reporting
• Medical Support
• Communication Issues
• Feeding of Personnel
• Location of Incident Facilities
The five paragraph operations plan discussed above has been effective in all types of operations
for many years. It is easyto produce and provides a thorough plan fromwhich to conduct
operations. Once the plan is written, it must be approved by the Incident Commanderor
superior, briefed to all concerned personnel, and disseminated in a timely manner.
SUMMARY:
A comprehensive Incident Action Plan is an important component of a successful and effective
incident response. The Incident Commander must ensure that the initial planning meeting is
convened as soon as possible, and that the incident planning process is initiated and maintained
by the Planning/Intelligence OIC.
If an agency specific Operations Planis utilized, it should be consistent with overall incident
objectives identified in the Incident Action Plan.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

SECTION VI
COMMUNICATIONS
COMMUNICATIONS:
Radio communications are an essential component of any emergency response. The challenge
of multi-agency and multi-discipline response is difficult, but may be addressed through use of
tactical communications planning and interoperable interfaces. Several mutual aid frequencies
are available for on-scene use and coordination. Planning and usage of these frequencies is
essential to ensure units or levels are able to communicate. Proper communications planning
identifies those units or sections thatneed to communicate directly, and those which do not.
Current interoperability standards allow different frequencies on different bands the ability to be
linked and transmit directly.
The following is an excerpt from the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Radio System
Plan. Critical response sections are provided for emergency operations. Refer to the Plan for
complete guidelines, eligibility and application procedures.
CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID RADIO SYSTEM (CLEMARS):
CLEMARS is the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Radio System. It is an extension of
the law enforcement mutual aid concept and is provided and managed by the California
Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES). The purpose of the system is to enhance
the ability for law enforcement agencies to communicate on common frequencies during
emergencies and other special operations.
Examples of situations wherein use of CLEMARS would be an asset include:
 An interagency team operation designed to serve a search or arrest warrant.
 An emergency call requiring two or more units from the same agency to coordinate response
to a crime in progress.
 A mutual aid response team, assigned to assist a neighboring jurisdiction.
 Law enforcement operations conducted at a parade, concert,or other special event involving
one or more law enforcement agencies.
 Operations required in response to a major disaster, involving units from several assisting
agencies that come from outside the impacted area.
 A transient law enforcement unit enroute to an out-of-town court appearance comes upon an
injury collision and requires a local dispatch center within range to relay an assistance
request.
NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID RADIO SYSTEM (NALEMARS):
There is a nationwide counterpart to CLEMARS, known as NALEMARS. This system, the
National Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Radio System consists of one channel, set aside by the
FCC as a mutual aid intercommunication channel, similar to our channels here in California.
The NALEMARS frequency is 155.475 MHz. NALEMARS is one of the California CLEMARS
channels. The application process for authorization is the same as that involved in the other
CLEMARS channels.
Note that NALEMARS may not be used for administrative or secondary communications. It is
only to be used in emergency or urgent situations.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 75
OPERATING PROCEDURES:
CLEMARSchannels should be considered an open “party line,” to the extent that only one user
in a given area can use the system at any one time. As a result, careful attention must be paid to
operating procedures. Improper procedures often involve “covering” another agency’s radio
transmission. This isnot only illegal—it can endanger peace officer safety. For this reason,
careful adherence to these procedures is mandatory.
General Operations:
Agencies generally have an established radio procedure. The same communications “style”
applies to CLEMARS. When using the system, units identify the unit or station they wish to
speak with, and then identify them. The message(s) transmitted must be official, as in use of all
other police radio systems. At the end of the message sequence, the units switch back to their
home radio channel. Note that the channel must be identified per FCC regulations, usually by
the base station.
Identification:
Mobile units must use their agency-assigned unit designator during transmissions. These should
not be shortened, but should include the entire set of letters and/or numbers. For example, a unit
that has an agency-assigned call sign of “Sheriff’s 48 Sam” should identify using those very
words. “Sam by” is insufficient identification. Likewise, “21 to 62” would be incorrect, if the
units’ true designators were “6 Paul 21” and “5 Tom 62.”
An exception would be during interagency operations. In this case, units should add
identification to indicate their agency as well, i.e. “Shasta 5201.”
Base stations should identify by using their agency name, along with any other usual identifier.
For example, “Control” would not be sufficient identification, and would constitute a violation
of proper procedure. More appropriate would be “Visalia Control,”“Tulare Sheriff’s Control,”
etc. Again, base stations must also use the FCC call sign shown on their CLEMARS license.
Monitor First:
As users must switch to CLEMARS before transmitting, the operator or officer may not be
aware of other personnel already using the channel. As such, it is a requirement that personnel
monitor the channel prior to transmitting, to minimize the possibility of interference with
communications in progress.
Use of Radio Codes:
While there are a few radio codes that almost everyone in law enforcement would understand,
many agencies utilize codes that are incompatible with those used in neighboring agencies.
While “Code 33” in one agency means “emergency traffic,” an agency a few miles away uses
the same radio code to mean “no warrants, past record not checked.” As such, operations on
CLEMARS are to be in “clear text,” avoiding the use of radio codes that could cause confusion,
and potentially jeopardize officer safety.
Encryption:
The use of any CLEMARS channel for transmission of any encoded, encrypted, digital, or
scrambled message is prohibited.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

SYSTEM PRIORITES:
The CLEMARS Plan establishes four priority levels for use of the system. In each case, traffic
of a higher priority level must be given use of the channel, with agencies utilizing it for lower
priority traffic yielding the frequency immediately.
 Priority 1 Disaster and extreme emergency operations for mutual aid and interagency
communications.
 Priority 2 Emergency or urgent operations involving imminent danger to the safety of
life or property.
 Priority 3 Special event control activities, generally of a preplanned nature, and
generally involving joint participation of two or more agencies.
 Priority 3a Drills, tests and exercises.
 Priority 4 Single agency secondary communications.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 77
Agencies must inform other area user agencies when they are involved in high priority usage of
CLEMARS channels. A broadcast should be made on CLEMARS as to restrictions on their use
of the channel. Additional notifications might take any of three forms:
1. CLETS message to adjoining CLEMARS users.
2. Notification via CLERS (point-to-point radio system).
3. Telephone calls to area frequent users.
 In all cases where a CLETS message is sent, a courtesy copy to mnemonic
“OES0” (CalOESat Mather) is appreciated.
 Consider use of the CLETS User Group Notification System.
 This system has been modernized and upgraded in many areas of the state for use as a
dispatcher’s “hotline” net.
COMMON OPERATING VIOLATIONS:
CLEMARS/NALEMARS FREQUENCIES
 FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND AND OBEY PRIORITIES
The CLEMARS Plan details four levels of priority operation. Some users fail to observe these
rules.
 USE AS A PRIMARY DISPATCH OR INQUIRY CHANNEL
Use for these types of transmissions is restricted to short-term situations. Such use on a day-to-
day basis is not consistent with CLEMARS operating philosophy.
 FAILURE TO IDENTIFY
FCC regulations and the CLEMARS Plan require units to use their full agency Unit designator
and stations to use their FCC call-sign.
 FAILURE TO USE UNIVERSAL CODES OR CLEAR TEXT
Each agency has different interpretations of radio codes. Avoid use of all but the most common
codes.
 FAILURE TO MONITOR PRIOR TO TRANSMITTING
When switching to CLEMARS/NALEMARS, monitor before transmitting to avoid covering other
units that may also be using the channel.
 USE OF SCRAMBLING
Scrambling is not permitted on CLEMARS channels.
 IMPROPER USE OF CODED SQUELCH
The CLEMARS Plan details appropriate use of tone or digital coded squelch.
 POOR OPERATION PROCEDURES
Officer safety could be hindered by use of the channels for unauthorized or unprofessional
transmissions.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

FIRST RESPONDER RESPONSIBILITIES; FIRST RESPONDER Checklist:
Upon arrival at a critical incident, the first responding officers mustorganize and take command
of the scene. Their duties can include such critical tasks as: establishing on-scene command,
formulating an action plan, broadcastinga situation assessment, setting up a command post
location, requesting necessary personnel and equipment, appointing others to control activities,
assigning missions, gathering intelligence, and delegating other tasks as necessary to establish
control andproviding a Staging Area for responding personnel.
To accomplish these tasks, the first responder should assume command responsibility until
properly relieved by an officer of higher rank.
To assist the first responders and all the following resources and staff, CalOEShas published a
manual entitled The Critical Incident Response Plan for First Responders, by Lt. John Kane
(ret.) of the Sacramento Police Department.
The main purpose of this manual is to give the first responder a user friendly four-step plan that
can control a wide variety of Critical Incidents from a barricaded gunman to natural and human
causeddisasters. The four-steps are:
LIE –Locate, Isolate, Evacuate.
MCI –Assess for a Mass Casualty Incident.
CHECKLIST –Use the Emergency Action Checklist.
ICS –Use the Incident Command System to best organize the Event.
Each step is explained in detail, along with a host of other important topics, such as:
Evacuations v. Rescues, Crisis Media Relations and Role of the Fire Department in Emergency
Operations.
The Critical Incident Response Plan for First Responders manual has been designed to
complimentthe California Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations in order to
providethe First Responder an operational plan that can be applied under stressful conditions
ensuring positivecontrol of a wide variety of Critical Incidents.
A series of Checklists hasbeen developed specific to the initial stages of different kinds of
Critical Incidents:
Situation Assessment:
A situation assessment is information developed by the first officer at the scene of an
emergency. It isbasic intelligence conveyedto the communication center, and elements
concerned with the control of the event. Situation assessments should be updated as the event
evolves. The initial situation assessment should include:
 Type of emergency
 Location of emergency
 Type of structure/vehicles involved
 Size of area involved
 Number of additional officers required
 Incident Command Post location
 Staging Area locations
 Ingress/Egress routes for emergency vehiclesLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 82
 Assistance required (e.g., ambulance, fire, public utility)
 Number and type of casualties/injuries
Once the situation assessment has been completed, the first responder (as Incident
Commander) can direct attention to control measures related to the event. These would include:
 Establishinga journal/log for recording major activities.
 Establishinga communication link with the communications center.
 Requestingpersonnel and equipment resources needed for the control of the event.
 Assigningpersonnel to staff ICS functions:
 Operations
 Planning/Intelligence
 Logistics
 Finance/Administration
Developingand implementingan operations planthat may include:
 Perimeter control provisions
 Interior patrol provisions
 Evacuation procedures
 Liaison with other emergency agencies
 Traffic control plans
 Mobilization of on-duty personnel
 Mutual Aid contingencies
An agency's role at the scene of disasters and other emergencies may be to support the local fire
department or other emergencyresponse force. The first responder (Incident Commander) can
be of assistance by providing the following:
 A liaison officer to the Fire Commander or other Command Staff
 Control of emergency vehicle ingress/egressroutes
 Perimeter traffic control
 Evacuation, if necessaryLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 83
INCIDENT COMMAND POSTChecklist:
This checklist assists the first responder and field supervisors in establishing an Incident
Command Post (ICP). The guidelines are flexible and can be modified to deal with specific field
situations. The purpose of an Incident Command Post is to:
□ Establish a facility that is located strategically to command the overall operation ofthe
emergency.
□ Maintain centralized and systematized communication.
□ Logistically monitor and regulate personnel and equipment needs.
□ Acquire, analyze and properly distribute intelligence and other relevant information.
□ Coordinate activities with associated agencies.
Incident Command Post (ICP) Selection Factors:
□ Strategically, but safely located.
□ Accessible to responding personnel.
□ Defensible against crowds, snipers, fire bombs, etc.
□ Sufficient space for responding personnel and equipment.
□ Accessible to restroom facilities.
□ Have communication capabilities or access to telephones, radio, television, microwave, etc.
□ Accessible toelectricity and water service.
□ Contain structures for personnel briefing and protection against weather.
□ Storage space and area for vehicles available.
Potential Command Post Sites:
□ Schools/Universities
□ Parks
□ Large parking lots
□ Water/Power facilities
□ Churches
□ Military armory
Establish Command Post:
□ Notify communications, Commander/Chief, and responding units of Command Post
location and staging area if at another location.
□ Request sufficient personnel for Command Post.
□ Identify routes to Command Post/Staging Area.
□ Appoint Command Post staff, as needed:
□ Radio Operator
□ Command Post Scribe

□ Identify radio frequency to be used.
□ Identify and isolate Command Post area with ropes or barrier tape.
□ Identify an area for Public Information Officer to coordinate news media activities.
□ Maintain open lines with communication center.
□ Keep all concerned personnel briefed as to status of problem.
□ Notify other concerned agencies:
□ Hospitals
□ Public Agencies
□ Other jurisdictions requiring informationLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 85
AIR OPERATIONSChecklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the Incident Commander (or Operations OIC) in determining
when and how to integrate aircraft operations into incident emergency response operations.
These guidelines are flexible and can be modified to deal with specific field situations.
Typical Aircraft Missions:
□ Standard Law Enforcement -reconnaissance, surveillance, suspect searches, direction and
control
□ Tactical Law Enforcement -SWAT rappelling platform, insertion and extraction,
intelligence gathering
□ Medical Evacuation -transport and insertion of emergency medical teams, extraction and
transport of litter patients and other injured persons
□ Search and Rescue (SAR) -search patterns, medical evacuation, ground team insertions and
extractions, equipment and supply drops
□ Fire Control -retardant drops, reconnaissance, fire crew insertions and extractions, heavy
equipment transport
□ Major Disasters -reconnaissance, situation and damage assessment, logistical support
□ Other Applications -communications relay, airborne command and control, photo mapping,
video aerial platform, searchlight illumination
Aircraft Limitations:
□ Weather -Obscured weather such as fog and rain may preclude air operations. Warm, moist
air, above 90 degrees with no or low wind conditions (especially at high altitudes) can
severely limit rotor performance. Extremely high or gusty winds can damage helicopters,
preclude rotor turn-up, and prevent flying near buildings or mountains.
□ Visual Flight Rules -Helicopters generally fly under Visual Flight Rules (VFR),which
require continual visual contact with the ground from a safe altitude.
□ Night Operations -Operations during darkness with limited or no horizon are potentially
dangerous and can place aircraft and crew in jeopardy. Night operations should not be
attempted without special equipment and training.
□ Altitude and Temperature -High altitude and/or high temperatures reduce rotor
performance and lifting capability. Expert aviation advice should be sought.
□ Operating Conditions -Helicopters generally should not be operated near soft dust, gravel
or sand. This may result in engine damage or loss of visual contact with the ground. Salt
water spray should also be avoided.
□ Small Arms Fire -Helicopters are vulnerable to small arms fire.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 86
Decision to Activate an Air Operations Branch:
The Air Operations Branch may be staffed whenever aircraft are deployed on an incident
requiring mission assignment coordination, establishment of helispots or a helibase, or to
address any aviation safety concerns requiring full time attention. If air operations are to be
conducted in conjunction with incident command post operations, then safety must be a primary
consideration. To ensure safe air operations are maintained it is recommended strongly that only
persons knowledgeable in aircraft operations and aviation procedures be assigned to leadership
positions within the Air Operations Branch.
Air Operations Branch Organization:
Air Operations
Branch
Air Mission Aviation
Group Support Group
Helibase
Helicopter Fixed Wing
Coordinator Coordinator
Helispot
Air Operations Branch:
The Air Operations Branch OIC, who is ground based, is primarily responsible for input to the
air operations portion of the Incident Action Plan. The plan will reflect agency restrictions that
have an impact on the operational capability or utilization of resources (e.g., night flying, hours
per pilot). After the plan is approved, the Air Operations Branch is responsible for
implementing its strategic aspects -those that relate to the overall strategy as opposed to those
that pertain to tactical operations. Specific tactical activities normally are performed by the Air
Mission Group OIC working with ground and air resources. Additionally, the Air Operations
Branch OIC is responsible for providing logistical support to aircraft operation on the incident.
Duties and Responsibilities –Air Operations Branch OIC:
 Obtain briefing from Operation OIC.
 Organize preliminary air operations.
 As appropriate, request declaration (or cancellation) of restricted air space area (Federal Air
Regulation 91.137).
 Participate in preparation of the Incident Action Plan.
 Perform operational planning for air operations.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 87
 Determine coordination procedures and communication for use by air organization with
ground Branches, Divisions or Groups.
 Supervise all Air Operations Branch activities associated with the incident.
 Establish procedures for emergency reassignment of aircraft.
 Schedule approved flights of non-incident aircraft in the restricted air space area.
 Inform the Air Mission Group OIC of the air traffic situation external to the incident.
 Consider requests for non-tactical use of incident aircraft.
 Resolve conflicts concerning non-incident aircraft.
 Coordinate with Federal Aviation Agency (FAA).
 Update air operations plans.
 Report to the Operations Section OIC on air operations activities.
 Assure approved crash-rescue, refueling, and maintenance support through Logistics for
extended operations.
 Report special incident/accidents.
 Arrange for an accident investigation team when warranted.
 Participate in safety/procedural meetings with other agencies pilots and air personnel in
multi-agency incident.
 Maintain unit log.
Air Mission Group:
The Air Mission Group OIC is primarily responsible for the coordination of aircraft operations
when fixed and/or rotary-wing aircraft are operating on an incident. The Air Mission Group
OIC reports to the Air Operations Branch OIC.
Duties and Responsibilities –Air Mission Group OIC:
□ Check-in and receive incident assignment.
□ Determine what aircraft (fixed wing and helicopters) are operating within area of
assignment.
□ Obtain briefing from Air Operations Branch OIC or Operations Section OIC.
□ Manage air activities based upon Incident Action Plan.
□ Establish and maintain communications with the Air Operations Branch, Fixed Wing and
Helicopter Coordinators, Aviation Support Group, and Support bases.
□ Coordinate approved flights in restricted air space area.
□ Obtain information about air traffic external to the incident.
□ Receive and document reports of non-incident aircraft violating restricted air space area.
□ Inform Air Operations Branch OIC of tactical recommendations affecting the air operations
portion of the Incident Action Plan.
□ Report on air operations activities to the Air Operations Branch OIC.
□ Coordinate the use of assigned ground to air and air-to-air communications frequencies with
Communications Unit and local agency dispatch center.
Aviation Support Group:
The Aviation Support Group OIC is responsible primarily for supporting and managing helibase
and helispot operations and maintaining liaison with fixed-wing air bases. This includes
providing (1) fuel and other supplies, (2) maintenance and repair of aircraft, (3) keeping records
of aircraft activity, and (4) providing enforcement of safety regulations. Helicopters,during
landing, take-off,and while on the ground,are under the control of the Aviation Support
Group's Helibase or Helispot Managers. The Aviation Support Group OIC reports to the Air
Operations Branch OIC.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 88
Duties and Responsibilities –Aviation Support Group OIC:
□ Obtain briefing from Air Operations Branch OIC or Operations Section OIC.
□ Obtain copy of the Incident Action Plan from the Air Operations Branch OIC.
□ Participate in Air Operations Branch OIC planning activities.
□ Inform Air OperationsBranch OIC of group activities.
□ Identify resources/supplies dispatched for Aviation Support Group.
□ Request special air support items from appropriate sources through Logistics Section.
□ Identify helibase and helispot locations (from Incident Action Plan) or from Air Operations
Branch OIC.
□ Determine need for assignment or personnel and equipment at each helibase and helispot.
□ Coordinate special requests for air logistics.
□ Maintain coordination with airbases supporting the incident.
□ Coordinate activities with Air Operations Branch OIC.
□ Obtain assigned ground-to-air frequency for helibase operations from Communications Unit
Leader or Communications Plan.
□ Inform Air Operations Branch OIC of capability to provide night-flying service.
□ Ensure compliance with each agency's operations checklist for day and night operations.
□ Ensure dust abatement procedures are implemented at helibase and helispots.
□ Provide crash-rescue service for helibase and helispots.
□ Maintain unit log.
Aviation Mutual Aid:
Generally, air operations in support of an incident are conducted at the local level within an
Operational Area (OA), which is the county.
If an OA exhausts its resources (including commercial) and it becomes necessary to request
aviation assets in support of a law enforcement mission from outside the OA, the request should
be directed by the local sheriff to the Regional Law Enforcement Coordinator. Exception:
During search and rescue incidents,the OA may contact CalOESdirectly to expedite response
for life safety purposes.(See CalOESpublication "Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan, SAR
Annex" for details.)
The Law Enforcement Branch of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Servicesmay endorse the
Regional Coordinator's loan of aviation assets from outside the requesting OA by assigning a
mission number. This does not result in reimbursement of costs! It may;however, facilitate
cost recovery should funds later become available.
If a disaster is widespread resulting in activation of the State Operations Center (SOC) to
coordinate simultaneous incidents in multiple OA’s or Regions, the SOC will activate its Air
Operations Branch to facilitate state and federal aviation mutual aid.
Helibase:
This is themain location for parking, fueling, maintenance, and loading of helicopters operating
in support of an incident. It is usually located at or near the incident base.
Helispot:
This is anydesignated location where a helicopter can take off and land safely. Some helispots
may be used for loading of supplies, equipment, or personnel.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 89
Helipad:
The specially designed and designated location, where a helicopter can take off and land safely
on a physical structure such as a building or ship.
Helicopter Landing Zone (LZ)
A generic term that can be applied to a helibase, helispot, or helipad.
Helicopter Landing Zone Considerations
Law enforcement helicopters may land at civil airports, heliports, and private heliports with
prior permission. Sparsely populated areas also may serve as landing sites depending on land-
use restrictions. Except as stated, a helicopter may not land in a densely populated area unless
an emergency exists. These restrictions do not preclude hovering at low altitudes to assist in
law enforcement operations. When planning for a landing zone, consider the following:
□ Establish a minimum landing area of 100 feet by 100 feet that is a level surface, free of
debris and overhead obstructions (such as power lines).
□ Choose an LZ that will not disrupt operations in the surrounding area (e.g., tents, map
boards, feeding areas, briefing areas)
□ Secure all loose items or potentially loose items.
□ Maintain clear ingress and egress to the landing location.
□ Ground personnel operating an LZ, or in the immediate area, should wear eye and ear
protection.
□ Steep aircraft approach angles are undesirable. Evaluate the height of adjacent obstacles to
minimize risks.
□ Try to avoid establishing an LZ near a body of water.
□ Do not establish an LZ within 1000 feet of a school unless an immediate emergency exists.
□ Night use of an LZ requires appropriate lighting. Plan ahead.
□ Rooftop helipad weight limitations may preclude landing larger aircraft on buildings.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

FIREChecklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the field supervisor in the initial stages of a fire. These
guidelines are flexible and can be modified to deal with specific field situations. Generally, the
Incident Commander will be from the fire service and law enforcement will assume a support
role.
Situation Assessment:
Ensure that a Situation Assessment has been prepared by field units and has been communicated
to the communications center. It should contain:
□ Location of emergency
□ Size of involved area, actual and potential
□ Apparent direction of the fire
□ Type of area (e.g., business, residential, hillside, etc.)
□ Ingress/egress routes for emergency vehicles
□ Additional law enforcement personnel needed
□ Location of staging area
□ Location and radio designation of Command Post
Liaison:
Establish liaison with fire command.
Deploy Personnel To:
□ Maintain ingress and egress routes for emergency vehicles.
□ Establish perimeter control, keeping unauthorized vehicles and pedestrians out of involved
area.
□ Establish anti-looting security patrols for evacuated areas within the perimeter.
□ Conduct an evacuation,if required.
□ Relieve (demobilize) personnel as activity is reduced.
□ Maintain a unit log.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations

WEAPONSOF MASS DESTRUCTION (WMD) ATTACK, POST BLAST EVENT AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS(HAZMAT)Checklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the first responder or incident commander in the initial stages
of the response to an act of terrorism whereina chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
weapon and/or an explosive were the mechanism of attack. These guidelines are flexible and
can be modified to suit specific situations. A WMD attack is, first and foremost, a HAZMAT
release. In fact, the intentional nature of such an act may not be immediately clear. Generally,
during the initial stages of an incident, fire suppression, rescue, and emergency medical services
dominate the incident operations. Therefore, during early stages of an event, the fire service is
the lead agency. As the scene stabilizes, and a criminal act is suspected, the incident command
will shift to law enforcement. The items listed in the checklist should be prioritized according to
the requirements of each specific incident.
Immediate Considerations:
Establish the Incident Command System and Unified Command as required.
SAFETY:
□ Consider secondary devices/releases.
□ Approach from uphill, upstream and upwind (monitor wind direction changes).
□ Do not drive through, or otherwise enter, any possible contaminated area.
□ Be aware of and avoid self-contamination.
□ Do not eat, drink, or smoke near the area.
□ Do not use flares —request barricades for traffic blocks.
□ Be alert for damaged utilities (electric lines, natural gas, etc.) structures in danger of
collapse/falling debris, hazardous substances, including un-detonated explosive material
from the initial explosion.
□ Utilize Personal Protective Equipment per training,as necessary.
ISOLATE:
□ Establish a perimeter at a radius from the seat of the explosion equal to one and one half
times the distance to the farthest debris for explosions where a hazardous materials release
has been ruled out.
□ Establish a perimeter at a radius of 1000 feet for a hazardous materials or unknown release.
□ Establish area to contain and identify uninjured witnesses.
□ Keep all non-essential personnel away from scene.
□ Establish an area to contain contaminated people for decontamination.
NOTIFY:
□ Incoming responders of ingress/egress routes
□ County HealthOfficer/Department
□ Local hospitals,if mass casualties are involved
□ Bomb Team (Technicians)
□ Hazardous Materials Team
□ Investigative Unit
□ Utility companies
□ Coroner, as necessary
□ FBI (if terrorism or weapons of mass destruction are suspected)
□ Public Information Officer
□ CalOESon all incidents
□ CHP,if state highwayand/or unincorporated roadway
□ Administering agency
□ Request National Guard Civil Support Team through the Mutual Aid System.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 93
Special Considerations:
□ Establish Incident Command to include liaison with fire, medical, and other necessary agencies.
□ Maintain log of activities.
□ Establish Incident Command Post in a location far enough outside of the perimeter that it
will not have to be moved for any reason.
□ Establish Incident Command Post Security.
□ Establish Staging Area(s).
□ Notify all incoming units of the staging area location.
□ Establish staging area security.
□ Assist injured victims.
□ Request/facilitate necessary fire suppression.

□ Document initial response.
□ Establish and preserve ingress and egress routes for emergency vehicles.
□ Protect evidence.
Situation Assessment:
□ Type of explosive/release, type of premises, vehicles involved.
□ Location of incident, size of involved area.
□ Direction of fluid, vapor or debris travel.
□ Weather conditions,wind direction, speed, and any expected changes.
□ Property and/or vehicle owner’s name.
□ Contents (NFPA 701 signage, placards, UN numbers), color of smoke and any odors.
□ Name of substance,if known.
□ Determine health hazards.
□ Symptoms of injured persons, and number of people involved.
□ Degree of danger at site, potential danger to surrounding area, city, and emergency crews.
Evacuation:
□ Give situation estimate to Incident Commander.
□ Decision to evacuate should be made by Incident Commander (see 409.5PC).
□ Develop plan to evacuate.
□ Refer to evacuation checklist for further information.
Contaminated Personnel:
□ Isolate from non-contaminated personnel.
□ Follow established hazardous materials decontamination procedures.
Note:Some hazardous materials react with water. Seek the advice of a qualified hazardous
materials technician/specialist.
Investigation:
□ Interviewing and identification of witnesses and/or possible suspects should begin as soon
as practical.
□ Evidence should not be disturbed until it can be evaluated and collected by a properly
trained and equipped Crime Scene Technician.
□ Collect information for incident reporting.
□ Investigations may be jointly conducted with other involved agencies.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 94
AMBER ALERT CRITERIAChecklist:
All four criteria must be met before an AMBER alert may be requested:
□ Is this a confirmed abduction?
□ Is the child 17 years of age or younger?
□ Is the person in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death?
□ Is there information available to provide to the general public,which could assist in the safe
recovery of the victim?
GUIDANCE:
The initial four hours after an abduction occurs are the most critical for putting out an AMBER
alert; however, this does not constitute a maximum time limit for issuing an alert. Respond to
any disappearance of a child as an abduction case until further information is developed.
Some examples that tend to qualify for broadcast:
□ A child is taken from home.
□ A vehicle was stolen or carjacked and a child was left inside the vehicle.
□ A child is taken by an adult without parental consent.
□ The childhas been reported missing, there is evidence of foul play and law enforcement
believes the childwas kidnapped.
Examples that do not meet the preceding criteria:
□ Children that have run away from home.
□ Missing children involved in child custody disputes (parental kidnapping), unless bodily
harm to the child is feared.
□ The child is over the age of 17 and not mentally or physically impaired.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 95
NON-FAMILYAbductionChecklist:
The Initial Investigation:
□ Assign an Officer to victim’s residence with the ability to record and “trace” all incoming
calls. Consider establishing a separate telephone line or cellular telephone for agency use.
□ Conduct neighborhood/vehicle canvass.
□ Compile a list of known sex offenders in the region.
□ Develop profile on possible abductor.
□ Consider using polygraphs for parents and other key individuals.
□ In cases of infant abduction, investigate claims of home births in that area.
□ Fully load NCIC Missing Person File (involuntary category) with complete descriptive,
medical, and dental information.
□ Utilize NLETS and other information systems to alert local, state, regional and federal Law
Enforcement agencies.
□ Provide support for family through nonprofit missing children’s organization.
The OngoingInvestigation:
□ Reviewall reports and transcripts of interviews.
□ Revisit the crime scene.
□ Review all potential witness/suspect information obtained in the initial investigation and
consider background checks on anyone identified in the investigation.
□ Review all photographs and videos.
□ Reexamine all physical evidence collected.
□ Review child protective agency records for reports of abuse on child.
□ Develop time lines and other visual exhibits.
□ Re-interview key individuals.
□ Interview delivery personnel: employees of gas, water, electric, and cable companies; taxi
drivers; post office personnel; garbage handlers; etc.
□ Critique results of the on-going investigation with appropriate investigative resources.
□ Arrange for periodic media coverage.
□ Contact CHP-Emergency Notification & Tactical Alert Center (ENTAC) (916) 657-8287.
□ Contact NCMEC, (800) THE-LOST (843-5678)for photo dissemination, age-progression,
and other case assistance.
□ Update NCIC Missing Person File information necessary.
Recovery/Case Closure:
□ Arrange for a comprehensive physical examination of the victim.
□ Conduct a careful interview of the child, document the results of the interview, and involve
all appropriate agencies.
□ Provide effective reunification techniques.
□ Cancel alarms and remove case from NCIC and other information systems.
□ Perform constructive post-case critique.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 96
AIRCRAFT CRASHChecklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the first responders with the initial response to an aircraft
crash. It is recommended that Unified Commandbe established to ensure a coordinated
response with other involved agencies. Local law enforcement generally will nothave an
investigative responsibility for aircraft crashes, but will provide perimeter control, site security,
evidence protection, and facilitate response with the fire service, medical-rescue, and federal
authorities that have investigative responsibility.
Situation Assessment:
Ensure that a situation estimate has been obtained, that it has been shared with the
communication center,and that it contains the following information:
□ Location of accident.
□ Type of structure involved.
□ Type of aircraft involved: military or civilian, passenger or cargo, helicopter or jet, private
or commercial.
□ Class of aircraft: single engine or multiple.
□ Estimated toll of injured and dead.
□ Additional assistance needed: police, fire, medical, military, etc.
□ Location of Command Post and Staging Area.
□ Best available ingress/egress routes for emergency personnel and vehicles.
Special Considerations:
□ Approach from up wind.
□ Do not approach on same path as aircraft.
□ Avoid breathing smoke, possible toxic materials.
□ Potential for fire/explosions.
□ Military aircraft may contain weapons, ammunition, ejection seats.
□ No smoking or flares.
□ Crash site security and adequate perimeter control to keep unauthorized persons from the
scene.
□ Traffic control, crowd control, perimeter control (keep a 2,000 foot clearance).
□ Evacuation (at least 2,000 feet upwind).
Crash Site Management:
□ Establish Command Post.
□ Restrict air traffic over scene.
□ Establish liaison with incident commander.
□ Identify all witnesses, obtain following data:
□ Time of crash.
□ Location of witnesses at time of crash.
□ Weather at time of crash.
□ Aircraft direction in flight.
□ Aircraft fire in flight.
□ Explosion prior to crash.
□ Location of objects falling from aircraft prior to crash.
□ Impact angle and position of survivors.
□ Anything removed from scene and by whom.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 97
Deceased or injured victims may be displaced by impact. Conduct a thorough, wide search for
survivors and other evidence, and take both video and photographs of the scene,if possible.
Ensure all crash debris is protected, but do not disturb wreckage, evidence, human remains, or
personal property unless advised to do so by the investigator in charge or the coroner in charge.
Subsequent Situation Assessment:
□ Aircraft identification numbers, owner(s) of involved aircraft and structures
□ Identification of pilot(s)
□ Property damage
□ Location of deceased and known survivors
Notification:
□ Military,if applicable
□ National Transportation Safety Board
□ Federal Aviation Administration
□ All necessary fire/rescue services
□ Hospitals of potential influx of patients
□ County CoronerLaw Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 98
EARTHQUAKEChecklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the field supervisor with the initial response to an earthquake.
Immediate Considerations:
□ Initiate a roll call of all units.
□ Initiate a check of "Critical Facilities" and confirm their status (Non-uniformed officers in
unmarked vehicles are recommended.) Checks to include:
□ High occupancy structures (depends on time of day).
□ Damage to roads, critical emergency facilities (police stations, fire stations, and
hospitals), refineries, dams, etc. (Note: every jurisdiction should have a pre-established
list of critical facilities.)
□ Initiate a critical facilities log that indicates which facilities have been checked and their
disposition.
□ Direct field units to initiate a general area survey after completing their critical facility
checks.
Accurate Situation Assessment is essential in an earthquake:
A quick evaluation of the situation must be made so that appropriate decisions can be made to
coordinate response efforts. Situation reports can be sent to local or regional Emergency
Operations Centers (EOC) so that appropriate emergency resources can be obtained and safely
deployed to the areas with the most critical need.
Specifics to look for:
□ Utility Disruptions
□ Flooding
□ Fire
□ Hazmat Spills or Plumes
□ Collapsed Buildings
□ Casualties (Injuries vs. Fatalities)
□ Damaged Roadways andBridges
Deploy Personnel To:
□ Conduct evacuations, if required.
□ Assist in establishing evacuation centers and directing people to them.
□ Establish ingress/egress routes for emergency vehicles.
□ Maintain perimeter control to keep unauthorized people and vehicles out of the involved
area (size of area depends on magnitude of the earthquake,which may be beyond your
resources and require mutual aid).
□ Direct traffic around major damaged sites.
□ Provide emergency information to residents of area.
□ Determine operability of telephone, water, gas, electricity, public transportation, and other
systems serving residents of the area.
Special Considerations:
Contrary to other emergencies, after an earthquake, watch commanders should consider
remaining at their stations to facilitate the damage assessment process until the extent of
damage and casualties are known and have been communicated to the EOC.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 99
Field officers generally should notbecome involved in rescue operations unless such incidents
are immediately life threatening and rescue can be accomplished rapidly. Officers must fulfill
their primary functions of observing, estimating, and communicating the overall situation
assessment. This is best accomplished by non-uniformed officers in unmarked vehicles.
Ultimately,this approach will save numerous lives in a major disaster, instead of the few that
each officer could personally rescue.

CIVIL UNREST/DISORDERChecklist:
This checklist is intended to assist the Incident Commander and field supervisors with initial
response to a riot or crowd/looting situation. Law enforcement agencies should concentrate on
the basic law enforcement mission of protecting life and property. This should be done in rapid,
firm, fair and impartial manner, using the minimum force necessary to accomplish the mission.
Tactical Objectives:
□ ESTABLISH: An Incident Command Post and Staging Area.
□ ISOLATE: Prevent the growth of the disorder. Cordon off the area. Deny access to those
not involved.
□ CONTAIN: Confine the disorder to the smallest area possible.
□ DISPERSE: Make arrests,if appropriate.
Situation Assessment:
□ Location of emergency
□ Number of participants
□ Activities of participants (looting, burning, blocking traffic, passive demonstration, etc.)
□ Direction of movement
□ Additional law enforcement personnel required
□ Access to Incident Command Post/Staging Area by responding personnel
Initial Response:
□ Assemble responding personnel into squads and Mobile Field Forces (MFF).
□ Assign a Public Information Officer to work with the media.
□ Brief the Squad/MFF leaders as soon as possible.
□ Establish Tactical Missions (e.g., crowd control, traffic control, site security, etc.).
□ Request Air Support (e.g., a police helicopter for observation and assistance in coordinating
tactical missions).
Liaison:
□ Establish liaison with the Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator and CalOES.
Other Considerations:
□ Know location of emergency medical services.
□ Maintain an operations log.
□ Determine the capabilities for less than lethal and chemical agents for each squad.
□ Utilize a tactical andcommand radio frequency.
□ Use serialized flex cuffs.
□ Use a video camcorder.
□ Arrange for the response of a field booking team.
□ Arrange for transportation of suspects from field booking area to detention facility.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 101
Helpful Hints:
□ Individualaction should be avoided (e.g., maintain squad formation integrity).
□ Simple formations (e.g., Squad Skirmish Line/Wedge or Arrest Circles) need minimal
explanation and/or coordination.
□ Passive demonstrators ---Don’t get involved until you have sufficient personnel.
□ Use standby time for scouting (gathering information and analyzing intelligence).
After Dispersal:
□ Establish a continuing highly visible law enforcement presence.
□ Use mobile units to respond to problems (squad size is the smallest recommended
maneuverable tactical element).
□ Arrange for relief and feeding of personnel.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 102
QUARANTINEInformation:
This information is presented to provide guidance for law enforcement personnel in the
assistance of Public Health Officials during times of medical emergency.
Public Health Officials at the State and local levels have the legal authority to impose
Quarantine and Isolation, or request a voluntary Containment of the public to assist in the
control of a communicable disease. It is possible that Public Health Officials may request law
enforcement to assist in these efforts.
Definitions: In order of severity:
Isolation (Most Severe)Isolation applies to persons with symptoms of a communicable
disease. They may be isolated at a hospital, home,or in another facility, in order to limit the
spread of the disease. Isolation can be either strict or modified depending upon the type of
disease and the conditions imposed by the Public Health Officer. Patients remain in isolation
until their status is changed by Public Health Officials.
Quarantine (Severe) Quarantine applies to persons who may have been exposed to a
communicable disease but are not yet ill. They are asked to remain at home or another location
and not interact with others in order to limit the spread of the disease.
Containment (Least Severe)Containment is an attempt to separate potentially contaminated
persons voluntarily. This may simply be accomplished by directing exposed persons to a
decontamination area or to health professionals. Public Health Officials may raise containment
to an Isolation or Quarantine status.
The following is a list of California Health and Safety Codes that allow state and local Public
Health Officials the authority to impose Quarantines and Isolations or request a voluntary
Containment. Additional codes within this list allow law enforcement to enforce the
Quarantines, Isolations and Containments.
These are examples of the most pertinent state codes, followed by information regarding
Federal Health procedures. The definitions are a summation of each code and are not complete.
For complete definitions and additional local authorities,one should consultwith their
departmentforlegal guidance.
Officers should be aware of the fact that all codes and statues pertaining to Quarantine,
Isolation or voluntary containment are Misdemeanors.

afflicted with any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease to willfully expose himself
or herself to another person. It also makes it a misdemeanor for a person to willfully expose a
person afflicted with the disease to someone else.
CA Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2516 Instructions for Strict or Modified Isolation
For cases of disease requiring strict isolation, Title 17, California Code of Regulations Section
2516 requires that the health officer give instructions to the patient and members of the
household defining the area in which the patient is to be isolated, the isolation technique to be
followed and the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. It requires that these
measures be followed. The isolation techniques will depend upon the disease.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 104
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE:
The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has statutory responsibility for
preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases in the United
States.
Under its delegated authority, the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, works to fulfill
this responsibility through a variety of activities, including the operation of Quarantine Stations
at ports of entry, establishment of standards for medical examination of persons destined for the
United States, and administration of interstate and foreign quarantine regulations, which govern
the international and interstate movement of persons, animals, and cargo.
Just as in the State of California, violation of these statutes is considered a Misdemeanor.
The legal foundation for these activities is found in Titles 8 and 42 of the US Code and relevant
supporting regulations. The main regulations to restrict potential communicable diseases from
entering the United States or from moving interstate are:
US CODE, Title 42, Section 70.2 –Measures in the event of inadequate local control.
Whenever the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines that the
measures taken by health authorities of any state or possession (including political subdivisions
thereof) are insufficient to prevent the spread of any of the communicable diseases from such
state or possession to any other state or possession, he/she may take such measures to prevent
such spread of the diseases as he/she deems reasonably necessary, including inspection,
fumigation,disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of animals or articles
believed to be sources of infection.
US CODE, Title 42, Section264. –Regulations to control communicable diseases
(a) Promulgation and enforcement by Surgeon General
The Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary, is authorized to make and enforce
such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission,
or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or
from one state or possession into any other state or possession. For purposes of carrying out
and enforcing such regulations, the Surgeon General may provide for such inspection,
fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles
found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human
beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary.
(b) Apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals
Regulations prescribed under this section shall not provide for the apprehension, detention,
or conditional release of individuals except for the purpose of preventing the introduction,
transmission, or spread of such communicable diseases as may be specified from time to
time in Executive orders of the President upon the recommendation of the National
Advisory Health Council and the Surgeon General.Law Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations
Page 105
(c) Application of regulations to persons entering from foreign countries
Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, regulations prescribed under this
section, insofar as they provide for the apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional
release of individuals, shall be applicable only to individuals coming into a state or
possession from a foreign country or a possession.
(d) Apprehension and examination of persons reasonably believed to be infected
On recommendation of the National Advisory Health Council, regulations prescribed under
this section may provide for the apprehension and examination of any individual reasonably
believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a communicable stage and
(1) to be moving or about to move from a State to another State; or
(2) to be a probable source of infection to individuals who, while infected with such disease
in a communicable stage, will be moving from a State to another State. Such regulations
may provide that if upon examination any such individual is found to be infected, he
may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary. For
purposes of this subsection, the term ‘’atate’’includes, in addition to the several states,
only the District of Columbia.
US CODE, Title 42, Section271. –Penalties for violation of quarantine laws
(a) Penalties for persons violating quarantine laws
(b) Penalties for vessels violating quarantine laws
(c) Remittance or mitigation of forfeitures
US CODE, Title 42, Section 70.5 –Certain communicable diseasesandspecial requirements.
The following provisions are applicable with respect to any person who is in the communicable
period of cholera, plague, smallpox, typhus or yellow fever, or who, having been exposed to any
such disease, is in the incubation period thereof:
(a) Requirements relating to travelers.
(b) Requirements relating to operation of conveyances.

SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) RESOURCES
Statutory Authority: In the State of California, the statutory authority and responsibility for
SAR operations resides with the County Sheriff (California Government Code Section 26614).
Refer to the California Emergency Management Agencypublication: Law Enforcement Mutual
Aid Plan, SAR Annex(commonly referred to as the “Green Book”)for additional information
on Search and Rescue Mutual Aid.
Variety of SAR Personnel and Resources: Search and Rescue personnel and resources vary
considerably within the State of California. There are a variety of generic and specialty rescue
teams available for mutual aid purposes consisting of both volunteers and paid professionals, or
a combination thereof. The most common SAR unit composition in California typically consists
of well-trained civilian volunteers (Registered Disaster Service Workers) affiliated with a
County Sheriff’s Department having a sworn-member as the unit supervisor or liaison.
Additionally;the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, Law Enforcement
Branch can access a variety of State and Federal Search and Rescue resources.
Ordering SAR Mutual Aid Resources: Due to the large variation in SAR team sizes,
capabilities,and resources, it is crucial that the agency requesting SAR mutual aid clearly define
the specific mission, anticipated duration, and the terrain and environmental characteristics.

Tracking/TrailingDogsare trained to follow the path that a lost person has taken. These dogs
require a properly preserved scent guide (i.e., a scent article like a sock or glove) and are not
distracted by other people in the area. These dogs work on long lead (leashes). Trailing dogs
most frequently work trails that are several days old. Trailing dogs can be useful in determining
Point Last Seen (PLS) and in establishing the probable boundaries of a search area.
Air Scent/Area Search Dogsare trained to alert to human scent in the area. Although not
required, scent guides can be of assistance to area search dogs. Area search dogs work most
frequently off-lead (no leashes) and can cover large areas. Area dogs are useful in hasty
searches and in determining Probability of Detection (POD) by “clearing”an area or by
detecting an area where the subject has been.
Search dogs also may be certified in the following specialty areas:
Avalanche Dogis a search dog trained and experienced in locating victims of an avalanche.
CadaverDogis a search dog trained and experienced in locating cadavers or human remains.

several “Litter Tenders”(usually one tender for the vertical environment and six tenders for
transportation over ground terrain or to assist as “Haulers”in the vertical environment), “Relief
Litter Tenders”(minimum of six), one “Belayer,”one “Rope Handler”(to assist the Belayer),
two to four “Trail Scouts”(to clear the trail), and one or two EMTs to render patient care while
enroute.
Note:A wilderness litter carry operation is demanding, difficult, time consuming,and labor
intensive. It should be considered the evacuation method of last resort. However, adverse
weather, unsuitable landing zones, steep terrain, or wilderness area restrictions on mechanized
vehicles may require the use of a Litter Team.
SAR –Medical Team: A SAR team of certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT)
specially trained and equipped to provide emergency medical care (minimum BLS-level) to
patients in the wilderness environment. Some SAR Medical Teams may be staffed with
paramedics, nurses, and/or doctors who can provide ALS patient care.

Hate Crimes (i.e. crimes motivated by bias) convey a message of terror and exclusion, not just
to the immediate victims but to entire communities. They often target victims who are least able
to defend themselves. They cause trauma that is more extreme and longer lasting than similar
crimes committed for other motivations. They can spark retaliatory crimes, escalating the cycle of
crime and violence. If not addressed professionally and thoroughly they may undermine public
confidence in law enforcement.
The 2018 California State Auditor’s Report, titled “Hate Crimes in California,” found that
California law enforcement has not taken adequate action to identify, report, and respond to
hate crimes. The report found that agencies did not properly identify some hate crimes, and
underreported or misreported hate crimes as well. The report also noted that hate crimes are on
the rise in California, increasing in both 2015 and 2016.
California Penal Code (CPC) 422.87 added new language and requirements to any newly created
or updated agency hate crimes policy. Effective January 1, 2019, any local law enforcement agency
that updates an existing hate crimes policy, or adopts a new one, shall include the content of the
model policy framework provided in this document as well as any revisions or additions to the
model policy in the future.
These guidelines are the primary elements that law enforcement executives are now required to
incorporate into their hate crimes policy if an agency creates a new hate crimes policy or updates
an existing one. The guidelines are designed for department-wide application and are intended to
reflect a values-driven “top-down” process. They are intended to assist with the development and
delivery of training and ensure proper identification, investigation, and reporting of hate crimes
within each agency’s jurisdiction.TABLE OF CONTENTS

4 CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAININGMODEL POLICY FRAMEWORK
Purpose
This model policy framework is designed to assist in identifying and handling crimes motivated by hate
or other bias toward individuals and groups with legally defined protected characteristics, to define
appropriate steps for assisting victims, and to provide a guide to conducting related investigations. It
outlines the general policy framework for prevention, response, accessing assistance, victim assistance
and follow up, and reporting as related to law enforcement’s role in handling hate crimes. It also serves as
a declaration that hate crimes are taken seriously and demonstrates how law enforcement agencies may
best use its resources to investigate and solve an offense, in addition to building community trust and
increasing police legitimacy.
Policy
It is the policy of this agency to safeguard the rights of all individuals irrespective of their disability,
gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and/or association with a person or
group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Any acts or threats of violence,
property damage, harassment, intimidation, or other crimes motivated by hate or bias should be viewed
very seriously and given high priority.
This agency will employ necessary resources and vigorous law enforcement action to identify and arrest
hate crime perpetrators. Also, recognizing the particular fears and distress typically suffered by victims,
the potential for reprisal and escalation of violence, and the far-reaching negative consequences of
these crimes on the community, this agency should attend to the security and related concerns of the
immediate victims and their families as feasible.
The agency policy shall include a requirement that all officers be familiar with the policy and carry
out the policy at all times unless directed by the chief, sheriff, director, or other chief executive of the
law enforcement agency or other command-level officer to whom the chief executive officer formally
delegates this responsibility.
The agency policy shall provide a specific procedure for transmitting and periodically retransmitting the
policy and any related orders to all officers, including a simple and immediate way for officers to access
the policy in the field when needed.
Response, Victim Assistance and Follow-up
Initial response
First responding officers should know the role of all department personnel as they relate to the agency’s
investigation of hate crimes and/or incidents. Responding officers should evaluate the need for additional
assistance, and working with supervision and/or investigations, access needed assistance if applicable.
Responding officers should ensure the crime scene is properly protected, preserved and processed.
At the scene of a suspected hate or bias crimes, officers should take preliminary actions deemed
necessary, to include, but not limited to, the following:
1. Use agency checklist (per CPC 422.87) to assist in the investigation of any hate crime (see appendix,

MODEL POLICY FRAMEWORK 9Training
All staff, including dispatch, desk personnel, volunteers, records, support staff, officers, supervisors, and
managers shall be properly trained on the department’s hate crimes policy. The agency will follow all
legislatively mandated training requirements.
POST offers training and video courses to assist law enforcement in the identification, investigation,
documentation and reporting of hate crimes. These courses provide officers with information and skills
necessary to effectively identify, investigate, document and report hate crimes. Various training programs
include the history and definitions of hate crimes, recognition of hate groups, international terrorism,
legal considerations, victims’ considerations, initial response duties, victim interviewing and care, suspect
identification and interrogation, evidence identification, report writing, the role of law enforcement,
investigative strategies, intelligence collection, supervisory roles, community relations, media relations
and local program training development, and other topics such as proper use of computer systems and
methods for reporting. POST also maintains an extensive array of training videos on applicable topics
such as working with those with mental illness and intellectual disabilities, hate crimes, and working with
minority communities.
For more information on POST training opportunities and available videos, visit the POST website at
www.post.ca.gov. In conjunction with POST training opportunities, trainers may utilize other state and
federal agencies that offer training courses, such as the U.S. Department of Justice.
Planning and Prevention
The general underreporting of hate crimes is an identified issue in California. Underreporting is caused
by victims not reporting hate crimes or hate incidents due to a number of factors, including fear of
reprisal and the belief that law enforcement will not properly investigate them. A report by the State
Auditor in 2018 determined that California law enforcement has not taken adequate action to identify,
report and respond to hate crimes. There is also an extreme underreporting of anti-disability and anti-
gender hate crimes. The agency’s plan to remedy this underreporting shall be inserted into the policy
(emphasis added).
In order to facilitate the recommendations contained within this policy, it is strongly recommended
that agencies build and strengthen relationships with the community, engage in dialogue, and provide
education to the community about this policy. Agency personnel are also encouraged to learn about
the inherent issues concerning their communities in relation to hate crimes. Assigned personnel should
perform the following:
1. Meet with residents in target communities to allay fears; emphasize the agency’s concern over this
and related incidents; reduce the potential for counter-violence; and provide safety, security, and
crime prevention information. Cultural diversity education and immersion programs (if available)
could facilitate this process.
2. Provide direct and referral assistance to the victim and his/her family.
3. Conduct public meetings on hate crime threats and violence in general.
4. Establish relationships with formal community-based organizations and leaders.
5. Expand, where appropriate, preventive programs such as hate, bias, and crime reduction seminars
for school children.
10 CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING6. Review the Attorney General’s latest opinion on hate crime statistics and targets in order to prepare
and plan for future crimes, specifically for Arab/Middle Eastern and Islamic communities.2
7. Provide orientation of and with communities of specific targeted victims such as immigrants,
Muslims, Arabs, LGBTQ, Black or African-American, Jewish, Sikh, disabled persons, etc.
Hate crimes are not only a crime against the targeted victim(s) but also have impacts on the victim’s
family and community. Working constructively with segments of this larger community after such crimes
is essential to help reduce fears, stem possible retaliation, prevent additional hate crimes, and encourage
any other previously victimized individuals to step forward and report such crimes. This is particularly
important if an upward trend has been identified in these crimes.
Although hate incidents are not criminal events, they can be indicators of, or precursors to, hate crimes.
Most California law enforcement agencies do not track hate incidents. It is recommended that hate
incidents be investigated and documented, if directed by policy, as part of the overall planning to prevent
hate crime.
Tracking social media is also another identified area to find indicators of, or precursors to, hate crimes. It
is recommended that agencies assign personnel to find, evaluate and monitor public social media sources
to identify possible suspects in reported hate crimes, or to determine suspects or suspect groups in future
hate crimes or hate incidents affecting the identified individuals, groups or communities that may be
victimized, and planned hate-based events.
Release of Information
Agencies should have procedure and/or policy on public disclosure of hate crimes. Establishing a
relationship with stakeholders, before any incident occurs, to develop a network and protocol for
disclosure would assist greatly in any disclosure.
The benefit of public disclosure of hate crime incidents includes:
1. Dissemination of correct information.
2. Assurance to affected communities or groups that the matter is being properly and promptly
investigated.
3. The ability to request information regarding the commission of the crime(s) from the victimized
community.
Agencies should provide the supervisor, public information officer, or designee with information that
can be responsibly reported to the media. When appropriate, the law enforcement media spokesperson
should reiterate that the hate crimes will not be tolerated, will be taken seriously, and will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.
Agencies are encouraged to consider the following when releasing information to the public regarding
hate crimes and hate incidents that have been reported within the jurisdiction:
2As described in CPC 13519.6(b)(8)
MODEL POLICY FRAMEWORK 111. Informing community organizations in a timely manner when a community group has been the
target of a hate crime.
2. Informing the community of the impact of these crimes on the victim, the victim’s family, and the
community, and the assistance and compensation available to victims.
3. Informing the community regarding hate crime law and the legal rights of, and the remedies
available to, victims of hate crimes.
4. Providing the community with on-going information regarding hate crime and/or hate incidents (if
policy requires it).
Reporting
The agency policy shall require development of a procedure for data collection, documentation, and
mandated reporting requirements. The agency shall:
1. Ensure that hate crimes are properly investigated, documented and reported.
2. During documentation, ensure hate crimes are flagged properly to allow for required reporting
to the California Department of Justice. This is typically indicated by the title/penal code section
identifying the report as a hate crime. Some agencies have added a check box specifically indicating a
hate crime that could, if required by the agency policy, require a secondary review by an investigator/
detective, supervisor or other identified party. It is the agency executive’s responsibility to determine
the form of documentation and type of indicators on crime reports.
3. The agency head or their designee (identified in the agency policy) should make a final
determination as to whether the incident should be classified as a hate crime by the agency.
4. Agencies shall develop procedures to comply with legally mandated reporting, including the
California Department of Justice, pursuant to CPC 13023.

limited to, hatred, animosity, resentment, revulsion, contempt, unreasonable fear, paranoia, callousness,
thrill-seeking, desire for social dominance, desire for social bonding with those of one’s “own kind,” or a
perception of the vulnerability of the victim due to the victim being perceived as being weak, worthless,
or fair game because of a protected characteristic, including, but not limited to, disability or gender.
Disability Bias
In recognizing suspected disability-bias hate crimes, officers should consider whether there is any
indication that the perpetrator was motivated by hostility or other bias, occasioned by factors such as,
but not limited to, dislike of persons who arouse fear or guilt, a perception that persons with disabilities
are inferior and therefore “deserving victims,” a fear of persons whose visible traits are perceived as
being disturbing to others, or resentment of those who need, demand, or receive alternative educational,
physical, or social accommodations.
In recognizing suspected disability-bias hate crimes, officers should consider whether there is any
indication that the perpetrator perceived the victim to be vulnerable and, if so, if this perception is
grounded, in whole or in part, in anti-disability bias. This includes, but is not limited to, if a perpetrator
targets a person with a particular perceived disability while avoiding other vulnerable-appearing persons
such as inebriated persons or persons with perceived disabilities different than those of the victim, those
circumstances could be evidence that the perpetrator’s motivations included bias against persons with the
perceived disability of the victim and that the crime must be reported as a suspected hate crime and not a
mere crime of opportunity.
Disability
Disability includes mental disability and physical disability as defined in GC 12926, regardless of
whether those disabilities are temporary, permanent, congenital or acquired by heredity, accident, injury,
advanced age or illness.
Gender
Gender means sex and includes a person gender identity and gender expression. Gender expression
means a person’s gender-related appearance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically associated with
the persons assigned sex at birth. A person’s gender identity and gender related appearance and behavior,
whether or not stereotypically associated with the person’s assigned sex at birth.
In Whole or In Part
“In whole or in part because of” means that the bias motivation must be a cause in fact of the offense
whether or not other causes also exist. When multiple concurrent motives exist, the prohibited bias must
be a substantial factor in bringing about the particular result. There is no requirement that the bias be a
main factor, or that crime would not have been committed but for the actual or perceived characteristic.
Nationality
Nationality includes citizenship, country of origin, and national origin.

Office of the City Manager
CONSENT CALENDAR
April 25, 2017
To: Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council
From: Dee Williams-Ridley, City Manager
Submitted by: Gil Dong, Fire Chief
Subject: 2016 Emergency Operations Plan
RECOMMENDATION
Adopt a Resolution adopting the 2016 Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), authorizing
the City Manager to revise any Annexes, Appendices and/or Attachments to the EOP,
and rescinding Resolution No. 58,659-N.S.
FISCAL IMPACTS OF RECOMMENDATION
No immediate impacts. The 2016 EOP establishes processes for Citywide fiscal
coordination during emergency response. These processes will help the City to maintain
maximum eligibility for financial assistance from State/federal government during
disaster response and recovery.
CURRENT SITUATION AND ITS EFFECTS
The 2016 Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) establishes the foundation for Berkeley’s
response to and short-term recovery from emergencies, disasters, incidents and events.
The EOP is scalable in order to address incidents that develop into emergencies,
planned events, and incidents, emergencies, or disasters that occur without warning.
The EOP utilizes an all-hazards planning approach, and is flexible enough to use for all
natural and manmade emergencies/events to which Berkeley is exposed, including
earthquake, Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fire, and terrorism.
The scope of this EOP is not tactical, nor does it focus on incident command at the field
level. Rather, the EOP addresses overall support and coordination of Berkeley’s
response to an emergency/event.
The EOP incorporates and complies with the principles and requirements found in laws,
regulations and guidelines of the federal, State of California, County of Alameda, and
City of Berkeley government. It is intended to conform to the requirements of the
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), the California State
Emergency Plan, and the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and to be
consistent with federal emergency planning concepts such as the National Response
Framework.

2016 Emergency Operations Plan CONSENT CALENDAR
April 25, 2017
EOP Structure
The Base Plan (Exhibit A) forms the foundation of the EOP. The Base Plan outlines the
authorities, structures and responsibilities of the Policy Level, departments and the
Emergency Operations Center (EOC). It describes the City’s coordination with County,
regional, State and federal entities, as well as external Berkeley partners.
In addition to this Base Plan, staff and partners will develop Functional Annexes and
Hazard-Specific Appendices to this EOP:
 Functional Annexes will detail the operations involved in particular Emergency
Support Functions (see Base Plan Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support
Functions);
 Hazard-Specific Appendices (see Base Plan Attachment 2: List of Functional
Annexes and Hazard-Specific Appendices) will detail particular response
requirements and challenges involved in response to specific hazard events.
Hazard-Specific Appendices will build on both the Base Plan and the 2014 Local
Hazard Mitigation Plan, which describes potential hazards, and maps hazard
exposure areas, and indicates hazards’ potential severity, frequency, and affected
population estimates.
BACKGROUND
The City of Berkeley’s most currently adopted citywide emergency response plan is the
Multi-Hazard Functional Plan (MHFP). The City Council adopted the MHFP on
September 24, 1996. Since then, the State of California has determined that the MHFP
format does not meet Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
requirements.
Since MHFP adoption in 1996, City staff has been continually developing, testing and
revising citywide emergency response plans. In 2015, the Office of Emergency Services
embarked on a concerted effort to finalize this 2016 EOP using current emergency
management concepts and requirements and bring it to the City Council for formal
adoption.
On September 2, 2016, the City of Berkeley Disaster Council convened to discuss the
2016 EOP. The Disaster Council is comprised of staff and external partner
representatives who are responsible for implementing Berkeley’s disaster response.
The Disaster Council recommends that the City Council adopt the 2016 EOP.
On December 7, 2016, the Disaster and Fire Safety Commission (DFSC) convened to
discuss the 2016 EOP. The DFSC recommended that the City Council adopt the 2016
EOP. Vote: (7 Ayes: Flasher, Jones, Legg, Grimes, Couzin, Degenkolb, Golomb; 0
Noes; 2 Absent.)

2016 Emergency Operations Plan CONSENT CALENDAR
April 25, 2017
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
Broadly speaking, the three priorities used in emergency response are protection of life,
property, and environment. Adopting the 2016 EOP will formalize these priorities on a
Citywide basis. This will in turn help the City to respond more effectively to emergencies
with negative environmental impacts.
RATIONALE FOR RECOMMENDATION
The City’s currently-adopted citywide emergency response plan is the MHFP, which
was adopted in 1996 and no longer meets State requirements for such plans. The 2016
Emergency Operations Plan meets local, State and federal requirements. Both the
Disaster Council and the Disaster and Fire Safety Commission have recommended that
the City Council adopt the 2016 EOP.
ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS CONSIDERED
Do not adopt the 2016 EOP and continue to remain out of compliance with State and
federal requirements for citywide emergency response plans.

disasters, incidents and planned events; and
WHEREAS, the 2016 EOP utilizes an all-hazards planning approach, and incorporates
and complies with the principles and requirements found in laws, regulations and
guidelines of the federal, State of California, County of Alameda, and City of Berkeley
government; and
WHEREAS, the City of Berkeley Disaster Council and the Disaster and Fire Safety
Commission recommend that the City Council adopt the 2016 EOP.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Council of the City of Berkeley that the
2016 Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) attached hereto as Exhibit A, is hereby adopted.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the City Manager is authorized to revise the Annexes,
Appendices, and/or Attachments to the EOP to maintain accurate and up-to-date
supporting information to the EOP, and that the City Manager shall inform the City Council
of such revisions.

Section 1: Introduction
1.1 Overview
1.1.1 Berkeley’s Emergency Management Program and Multi-Agency
Coordination System
The City of Berkeley’s Emergency Management Program coordinates the City’s actions to
mitigate, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from any emergency, disaster, or
event. The program encompasses all City organizations, agencies, departments, entities,
and individuals responsible for emergency management activities.
Berkeley’s Multi-Agency Coordination (MAC) System is the element of Berkeley’s Emergency
Management Program focused on response to and short-term recovery from emergencies,
disasters, incidents and events1. Berkeley’s MAC System is made up of the facilities,
equipment, personnel, communications and procedures that City government and external
partners use to respond.
The purpose of this Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) is to establish procedures to implement
Berkeley’s MAC System. This document is the EOP Base Plan.
1.1.2 Emergency Operations Plan Scope
This EOP Base Plan establishes the authorities, structures and responsibilities of the Policy
Level, departments and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). It describes the City’s
coordination with County, regional, State and federal entities, as well as external Berkeley
partners.
This EOP Base Plan is scalable in order to address both incidents that develop into
emergencies, planned events, as well as incidents, emergencies or disasters that occur
without warning.
The scope of this EOP is not tactical, nor does it focus on Incident Command at the field level.
Rather, the EOP addresses overall support and coordination of Berkeley’s response to an
emergency/event.
1 SEMS uses four related terms to describe conditions that impact normal government and community functions
and could require MAC System use:
 Incident: An occurrence or event, either human‐caused or by natural phenomena, that requires action
by emergency response personnel to prevent or minimize loss of life or damage to property and/or
natural resources.
 Emergency: A condition of disaster or of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property caused by
such conditions as air pollution, fire, flood, hazardous material incident, storm, epidemic, riot, drought,
sudden and severe energy shortage, plant or animal infestations or disease, the Governor's warning of
an earthquake or volcanic prediction, or an earthquake or other conditions, other than conditions
resulting from a labor controversy.
 Disaster: A sudden calamitous emergency event bringing great damage loss or destruction.
 Event: A planned, non‐emergency activity.
Unless specified otherwise, references to “emergency/event” in this EOP describe an incident, emergency,
disaster or event requiring MAC System use.
1‐1Page 8 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
In addition to this Base Plan, Functional Annexes to this EOP will detail the operations
involved in particular Emergency Support Functions (see Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support
Functions).
This EOP utilizes an all-hazards planning approach, and is flexible enough to use for all
natural and manmade emergencies/events to which Berkeley is exposed. These include:
• Earthquake
• Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) fire
• Landslide
• Severe storms and flooding
• Tsunami
• Hazardous materials release
• Terrorism
Berkeley’s Local Hazard Mitigation Plan summarizes Berkeley’s hazard analysis. It includes
a description of potential hazards and maps of their exposure areas, as well as information
about their severity potential, affected population estimates, and frequency. Some of these
hazards have particular response requirements and challenges. Specific response
coordination necessary for these hazard events will be further detailed in the Hazard-Specific
Appendices to this EOP (see Attachment 2: List of Functional Annexes and Hazard-Specific
Appendices).
1.1.4 Standardized Emergency Management System and National
Incident Management System
The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) is the cornerstone of California’s
emergency response system and the fundamental structure for the response phase of
emergency management. SEMS is required by the California Emergency Services Act for
managing multiagency and multijurisdictional responses to emergencies in California. The
system unifies all elements of California’s emergency management community into a single
integrated system and standardizes key elements. SEMS incorporates the use of the Incident
Command System (ICS), California Disaster and Civil Defense Master Mutual Aid Agreement
(MMAA), the Operational Area (OA) concept and multi-agency or inter-agency coordination.
State agencies are required to use SEMS and local government entities must use SEMS in
order to be eligible for any reimbursement of response-related costs under the State’s disaster
assistance programs.
In addition to SEMS, the State of California and its political subdivisions are responsible for
compliance with National Incident Management System (NIMS) requirements as defined in
the Homeland Security Presidential Directives. The State promotes and encourages NIMS
adoption by associations, utilities, Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs), private sector
emergency management, and incident response organizations to enhance emergency
management effectiveness. SEMS and NIMS are designed to be compatible and are based
on similar organizational principles.
The plan incorporates and complies with the principles and requirements found in laws,
regulations and guidelines of the federal, State of California, County of Alameda, and City of
Berkeley government. It is intended to conform to the requirements of SEMS, the California
State Emergency Plan, and NIMS, and to be consistent with federal emergency planning
1‐2Page 9 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
concepts such as the National Response Framework.
All references to SEMS from this point forward in this Emergency Operations Plan, its
attachments, its annexes and its appendices, will additionally imply NIMS compliance.
1.1.4 Access and Functional Needs
The City of Berkeley is committed to ensuring that all emergency plans and response/recovery
activities integrate all community members, including persons with access and functional
needs2. Access and functional needs may occur in areas including but not limited to: physical
accessibility, communications, medical care, access to medications and assistive technology,
independence maintenance, and transportation.
To this end, this Emergency Operations Plan and its attachments, functional annexes and
hazard-specific appendices will include provisions to ensure that described emergency/event
response and recovery activities effectively integrate community members with access and
functional needs.
When Berkeley’s MAC System operationalizes this EOP during emergency/event response
and recovery, leaders at all levels will be responsible for using the provisions outlined in this
EOP and detailed in its attachments, annexes and appendices to ensure that the response
meets community members’ access and functional needs.
2 Access and Functional Needs are “those actions, services, accommodations, and programmatic, architectural,
and communication modifications that a covered entity must undertake or provide to afford individuals with
disabilities a full and equal opportunity to use and enjoy programs, services, activities, goods, facilities,
privileges, advantages, and accommodations in the most integrated setting, in light of the exigent circumstances
of the emergency and the legal obligation to undertake advance planning and prepare to meet the disability
related needs of individuals who have disabilities defined by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, P.L. 110‐325,
and those associate with them.” (FEMA, Functional Needs Support Services Shelter Support Guide Page 41)
People with disabilities are protected from discrimination under a variety of laws, including the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and portions of the California Civil Code.
Public programs, including but not limited to those initiated during disaster response, may not discriminate
against people based upon a disability and must offer all services, programs, and activities in ways that allow
equal participation.

1.4 Document Management and Distribution
The City of Berkeley EOP Base Plan will be reviewed biennially and revised as necessary. The
Fire Department – Office of Emergency Services (OES) will initiate the process and engage the
support of departments with relevant EOC responsibilities. Each plan revision will be authorized
by identified approval and advisory authorities, as stated by current City administrative codes.
The plan may be modified as a result of analyses of actual responses or exercises. It may also
be modified if responsibilities, procedures, laws, rules, or regulations pertaining to emergency
management operations change. Records of revisions to the EOP will be maintained by OES on
the register at the beginning of this document. The distribution list for this EOP is included as
Attachment 3: Distribution List.
Those departments having assigned responsibilities under this plan are obligated to inform Fire-
OES when organizational or operational changes affecting this plan occur or are imminent.
Changes will be published and distributed to relevant organizations.

2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Section 2: Concept of Operations
The City of Berkeley must be prepared to promptly and effectively respond to any foreseeable
emergency/event and to take all appropriate actions, including requesting and providing resources.
To do so, Berkeley City government will work with many other governmental, non-governmental,
and private organizations. This Concept of Operations (ConOps) guides City decision-makers and
plan users regarding the sequence and scope of actions to be taken during a citywide emergency
response.
The ConOps outlines general concepts guiding Berkeley’s MAC System and the emergency
proclamation process; describes the structure and positions managing Berkeley’s MAC System;
outlines practices for emergency management coordination within City government and with
external partners; and describes standard operating procedures for Berkeley’s Emergency
Operations Center.
2.1 General Concepts
First, this section uses the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) to describe
interactions between field responders, City government, the Alameda County Operational Area
(OA), and the State of California emergency management organizations. Second, this section
outlines the emergency proclamations process.
2.1.1 SEMS Organizational Levels1
In accordance with SEMS, California’s emergency response operations rely on a system in which
government levels work together from the Field Level upward, in a single, integrated structure.
Incidents are managed at the lowest possible level. Local government has primary responsibility for
emergency response activities within its jurisdiction. Operational Areas, the region, and the State
support local jurisdictions.
SEMS also provides a standardized response structure for emergencies involving multiple
jurisdictions or multiple agencies in California. It defines a standard management structure and
standard terminology for Statewide use. SEMS is applicable to all organizational levels and
functions in the emergency response system. There are five designated levels in the SEMS
organization, which are identified in the figure that follows.
1 Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) Guidelines, 2006, Part I: System Description
2‐1Page 15 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Field Response Level
•Command emergency response personnel and resources to carry out tactical
(Incidents and Area
decisions and activities in direct response to an incident or threat.
Commands)
Local Government Level
•Manage and coordinate the overall emergency response and recovery
activities within their jurisdiction.
(Cities and Special Districts)
Operational Area (OA) Level •Manages and/or coordinates information, resources, and priorities among
local governments within the operational area and serves as the
coordination and communication link between the local government level
(Counties)
and the regional level.
•Manages and coordinates information and resources among OAs within the
Regional Level region, and between the OAs and the State Level. Along with State Level,
coordinates overall State agency support for emergency response activities.
•Manages State resources in response to the emergency needs of the other
levels. Manages and coordinates mutual aid among the mutual aid regions
State Level
and with the Regional Level, and serves as the coordination and
communication link with the federal disaster response system.
Figure 2-1: SEMS Organizational Levels and Functions
(CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 1, Section 2403)
SEMS Field Level
The SEMS Field Level is where emergency response personnel and resources, under the
command of responsible officials, carry out tactical decisions and activities in direct response to an
incident or threat. SEMS uses ICS, as defined in Section 1: Introduction, to control and coordinate
Field Level response activities. ICS provides a standard organizational structure to facilitate
coordination of multiple organizations in the Field Level. During Field Level response operations,
DOCs and/or the EOC may or may not be activated depending on the severity and type of
emergency/event. Generally, if day-to-day response activities can resolve an emergency situation,
response will remain at the Field Level. Incident Command Posts, Unified Command Posts, and
Area Command Posts are all Field Level organizations.
SEMS Local Government Level
The Local Government Level includes cities and special districts. Local governments manage and
coordinate the overall emergency response and recovery activities within their jurisdiction. The
Local Government Level supports, but does not command, Field Level operations.
Departments/DOCs and EOCs are Local Government Level organizations. In order to be eligible
for State reimbursement of response-related costs, local governments are required to use SEMS
when their Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated or a local emergency is declared or
proclaimed.
SEMS Operational Area (OA) Level
An OA is the intermediate level of the State’s emergency management organization, which
2‐2Page 16 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
encompasses a county’s boundaries and all political subdivisions located within that county,
including special districts. The OA facilitates and/or coordinates information, resources and
decisions regarding priorities among local governments within the OA. The OA serves as the
coordination and communication link between the Local Government Level and Regional Level.
State and federal jurisdictions in the OA (e.g., the California Highway Patrol and the University of
California at Berkeley) may have statutory authorities for response similar to that at the Local Level.
In the Alameda County Operational Area (ALCO OA), the Alameda County Office of the Sheriff
serves in the capacity of the OA emergency management agency (referred to as the Alameda
County Office of Emergency Services [ALCO OES]).
SEMS Region Level
California is divided into three California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) Administrative
Regions – Inland, Coastal and Southern. The Alameda County OA is part of the Cal OES Coastal
Region, which includes the 16 OAs in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. These OAs are:
Alameda, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, San
Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, and Sonoma.
The three Cal OES Administrative Regions are further divided into six mutual aid regions. The
Alameda County OA is part of Mutual Aid Region II.
The Cal OES Administrative Region Level manages information and supports the coordination of
resources (1) among OAs within the region, and (2) between the OAs and the State Level. The
Region Level also coordinates overall State agency support for emergency response activities
within the region.
Region Level activities are generally carried out at the Regional Emergency Operations Center
(REOC), located in Walnut Creek. The REOC serves as a link between OAs and the State
Operations Center (SOC), located in Mather.
SEMS State Level
The State Level prioritizes tasks and coordinates State resources in response to requests from the
Regional Level. Cal OES manages and coordinates mutual aid (1) among the mutual aid regions,
and (2) between the regions and the State Level. The State Level operates out of the SOC.
The State Level also serves as the coordination and communication link between the State and
the federal emergency response system. In the event that OAs and the region require federal
assistance, requests are made from the local Level through the appropriate SEMS channel to the
SOC. The State Level requests assistance from other state governments through the Emergency
Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) and similar interstate compacts/agreements and
coordinates with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) when federal assistance
is requested.
City of Berkeley and SEMS
According to State law, the City is required to adopt and implement SEMS. As stated earlier, under
SEMS and the California Emergency Services Act, the City has local government responsibility to
manage information and coordinate resources for all City departments, and to serve as the link
between Berkeley and the ALCO OA.
2‐3Page 17 of 108

2.1.2 Emergency Proclamations and Declarations
Local Emergency Proclamation
When conditions of extreme peril exist that threaten the safety of persons and property within
Berkeley, and these conditions are likely to be beyond the control of the City of Berkeley’s
services, personnel, equipment, and facilities, the Director of Emergency Services requests the
City Council to proclaim a Local Emergency. If City Council cannot be convened, the DES may
proclaim a Local Emergency.
A Proclamation of a Local Emergency:
 Authorizes the undertaking of extraordinary police powers
 Provides limited immunity for emergency actions of public employees and governing
bodies
 Authorizes the issuance of orders and regulations to protect life and property (e.g.,
curfews)
 Activates pre-established local emergency provisions such as special purchasing and
contracting
 Serves as a prerequisite for requesting a Governor’s Proclamation of a State of
Emergency and/or a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency or Major Disaster
Local emergency proclamations are not required for fire or law mutual aid, or for Red Cross
response.
Deadlines
The Proclamation of Local Emergency must be:
 Issued within 10 days of the occurrence of a disaster if assistance will be requested
through the California Disaster Assistance Act (CDAA).
 Ratified by City Council within 7 days of issuance (if issued by Director of Emergency
Services)
 Reviewed and renewed at regularly scheduled City Council meetings until terminated
o Note: no review period is to exceed 21 days from last review
 Terminated when conditions warranting proclamation have ended
State and Federal Proclamations and Declarations
Should the situation necessitate State or federal disaster assistance, the Director of
Emergency Services/City Council has the authority to request the Governor (through the
ALCO OA) to proclaim a “State of Emergency.” State OES must receive request from local
government within 10 days of the incident.
Four levels of disaster assistance are available, including:
 Director’s Letter of Concurrence
 Governor’s State of Emergency Proclamation
 Federal (Presidential) Declaration of an Emergency
 Federal (Presidential) Declaration of a Major Disaster
Each is used for unique circumstances and provides specific types of aid.
Notification and Coordination
When issuing a Proclamation of Local Emergency, the following notifications should be made:
 City of Berkeley notifies the ALCO OA via whatever communications are available (email,
2‐4Page 18 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
fax, phone, radio) and provides a copy of the Local Emergency Proclamation as soon as
possible
 Alameda County Operational Area notifies Cal OES Coastal Region and provides a copy
of the proclamation as soon as possible
 Cal OES Coastal Region notifies the Cal OES Director and Deputy Directors; Cal OES
Coastal Region shall be the primary contact between the Cal OES Director, the Alameda
County Operational Area and the City for updates or on any requests for assistance
 Cal OES Director will respond in writing to the City concerning the status of any requests
for assistance included within Berkeley’s Proclamation of Local Emergency or
accompanying letter
Note: If the ALCO OA proclaims a local emergency for Alameda County and makes its own
request to the Governor for a State of Emergency, the City of Berkeley does not need to send
the State its own written Proclamation of Local Emergency.
2‐5Page 19 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
2.2 MAC System Management Structures
Berkeley’s MAC System is organized according to SEMS requirements and guidance for the
Local Government and Field Levels. The following Local Government Level management
structures may be activated depending on the needs of the emergency/event:
 City Manager/Director of Emergency Services
 Policy Group
 City Council
 Emergency Operations Center
 Department Operations Center (DOC)
This section outlines the roles and responsibilities of positions in each management structure.
For the EOC, Section 2.2: Management Structures outlines roles and responsibilities of the EOC
Management Section only. Section 3: EOC Sections details the roles and responsibilities of
personnel in the other EOC sections.
2.2.1 City Manager/Director of Emergency Services2
The Director of Emergency Services (DES) is a policy authority. The DES is ultimately
responsible for the efforts of the City’s Emergency Organization. It is the DES’s duty to exercise
his/her powers in order to protect life and property within Berkeley during an emergency. In an
emergency/event, the DES serves over consecutive shift changes and operational periods.
The City Manager serves as the DES. If the City Manager is unavailable to serve as DES, the
individual serving as DES3 concurrently serves as City Manager. City Manger duties may include:
 Coordinating with the Policy Group (see below) to review situation information and
establish citywide priorities based upon operational requirements and City capabilities.
 Serving as the EOC Director (see Section 2.2.4: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)).
2.2.2 Policy Group
The Policy Group is a policy authority. According to the requirements of the situation, the City
Manager may assemble appropriate City department and external agency representatives to
form a Policy Group. Per SEMS4, the Policy Group serves as Berkeley’s multi-agency
coordination group (MAC Group). The Policy Group establishes citywide priorities among multiple
competing incidents and develops policy directives to guide the SEMS Local Government Level
and Field Level response.
The City Manager can convene a Policy Group with or without an EOC activation. The Policy
Group supports emergency/event response efforts, continuity of government, and continuity of
City operations, and advises the City Manager on policy issues affecting Berkeley.
Per City Manager direction, Policy Group responsibilities may include:
2 City of Berkeley Municipal Code, Chapter 2.88 Emergency Services And Disaster And Fire Safety Commission
3 In order to ensure continuity of government, the City of Berkeley has a line of succession for the Director of
Emergency Services position.
4 California Statewide Multi‐Agency Coordination System Guide, February 2013, p. 2
2‐6Page 20 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
 Convene as needed to address policy issues (e.g., curfew, authorization of evacuation
orders, authorization of responder/EOC requests to deviate from City/department
policies)
 Prepare and execute rules, regulations, proclamations and/or orders as necessary
 Respond to requests from the Public Information Officer
 Interface with City Council and community leaders
 Act as a liaison to federal, State, and County elected officials
 Act as a liaison to local jurisdictions
 When the EOC is activated:
o Respond to requests for policy direction from the EOC
o Ensure EOC adherence to Policy Group’s citywide priorities and
directives
o Support decisions and actions of the EOC
Because the Policy Group is a policy authority, Policy Group members may serve over
consecutive shift changes and operational periods. A Policy Group member may also
concurrently serve in a functional position in the EOC or a Department. However, to ensure
members’ ongoing availability to the City Manager, as well as continuity of EOC/Department
operations, each Policy Group member serving in the EOC or a Department must have an
assigned deputy with authority to serve in his/her EOC/Department role as he/she performs
his/her Policy Group duties.
The City Manager may also activate/utilize three staff positions for support in implementing
policy decisions:
 City Attorney: The City Manager may utilize the City Attorney to provide legal counsel
on matters pertaining to emergency/event response. The City Attorney may also
assist in the preparation of proclamations, ordinances, and other legal documents.
The City Attorney may concurrently serve as the EOC Legal Officer (see Section
2.2.4: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)).
 City Clerk: If the emergency/event will require emergency proclamations and
declaration requests (see 2.1.2 Emergency Proclamations and Declarations), the City
Manager will utilize the City Clerk to coordinate emergency Council sessions.
 Council Liaison: The City Manager may activate the Council Liaison position to ensure
that City Councilmembers have a central point of contact during high-profile
emergencies or events, and/or in situations requiring City Council ratification of DES
orders and proclamations.
Because these positions are not policy authorities, their staffing will be in accordance with
operational period staffing patterns used by the Emergency Operations Center (see Section
2.2.4: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)).
2.2.3 City Council
In an emergency or disaster, the Mayor and City Councilmembers and their Standby Officers
must be ready to ensure continuity of government and support emergency response.
The responsibilities of City Council are as follows:
 Obtain briefings from the City Manager and/or Council Liaison and convey information
about community impacts
 Consider the need to replace Mayor or Councilmembers unable to perform their
responsibilities due to absence, injury, or death
2‐7Page 21 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
 If needed, conduct an emergency City Council Session to ratify Proclamation of Local
Emergency within 7 days of issuance by DES
 Review proclamation at regularly-scheduled Council meetings (no review to exceed 21
days from last review)
 Terminate proclamation as soon as emergency conditions are over
 Work with the Council Liaison to assist in the distribution of information to the
community, and to provide interviews with the press as needed.
City Council is a policy authority, and members may serve over consecutive shift changes and
operational periods.
City Council chambers are located at 2134 Martin Luther King Jr. Way. In the event that this
location is unusable, the alternate site for City Council meetings will be Longfellow Middle School
at 1500 Derby Street. In the event that City Council chambers and Longfellow Middle School are
unusable or unavailable, an alternate site will be determined based on the nature of the event and
the needs of the City.
2.2.4 Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
In accordance with SEMS, the Emergency Operations Center supports the MAC function at the
Local Government Level, ensuring that all response systems are interconnected and
complementary rather than duplicative. The EOC is a coordination and support structure that is
separate from departments or on-scene Incident Command Post(s). The EOC exchanges
information with the Field Level, Departments/DOCs (see Section 2.2.5 Departments/Department
Operations Centers), and other governmental and non-governmental agencies.
The EOC supports all levels of the MAC System, facilitating actions necessary to protect the
Berkeley community, property and environment during a citywide emergency/event. The primary
responsibilities of the EOC are:
 Collect, analyze, and disseminate information
 Maintain a citywide common operating picture of City response activities
 Prepare citywide situation reports
 Coordinate/communicate the City Manager/DES’s citywide priorities and directives to other
levels of the MAC System
 Communicate policy questions to the City Manager/DES and Policy Group from the EOC
and other levels of the MAC System
 Implement emergency/event management-by-objective
o Reconcile competing objectives
o Coordinate resource allocation priorities
 Organize and activate Berkeley’s Emergency Support Functions (see Section 2.3.1:
Emergency Support Functions).
The EOC is staffed with specially-trained personnel and equipped with systems and tools that aid in
data collection and sharing, resource allocation, and other critical functions.
EOC Structure
The EOC is organized per the SEMS Guidelines for Local Government,5 providing EOC staff with a
standardized operational structure and common terminology based on five major functional areas:
Management, Plans/Intelligence, Operations Support, Logistics, and Finance/Administration. The
5 SEMS Guidelines, November 2009, Part I.C: System Description – Local Government Level, p. 10

EOC Management Section
The EOC Management Section will support overall activities put forth by the EOC Section
Coordinators. Management Section positions are functional positions and not policy authorities,
and therefore will be staffed in accordance with EOC staffing patterns and operational periods.
Management Section positions and responsibilities are outlined in the table below.
EOC Management Section Positions and Responsibilities
Responsible for overall management of the EOC,
coordinating with the ALCO OA EOC, and other outside
assisting organizations. As a standalone position, the EOC
Director does not have a command role in any
emergency/event. Assigns support positions as needed for
EOC Director management of EOC facility, information technology (IT),
and other related services.
Note: For continuity of EOC management, EOC
Coordinator assumes EOC Director duties when EOC
Director is in meetings or offsite.
Facilitates EOC workflow. Ensures appropriate information
exchange among EOC members and from the EOC to other
EOC Coordinator levels of the MAC System.
Note: Responsible for overall management of the EOC when
the EOC Director is offsite.
Serves as the point of contact for the Joint Information
Public Information Officer Center, which coordinates and disseminates
(JIC Coordinator) emergency/event information to the public, the media, and
other relevant stakeholders.
Advises EOC staff on legal matters and directs inquiries to
the City Attorney’s Office as appropriate. (Legal Officer may
Legal Officer
concurrently serve as City Attorney in support of City
Manager/Policy Group.)
Coordinates with all outside agency representatives that
Liaison Officer have been assigned to the EOC, but are not integrated into
the Operations Support Section.
Monitors all aspects of emergency operations to ensure the
Safety Officer
safety of all City personnel involved with response activities.
Controls personnel access to and from the EOC and other
Security Officer facilities, as determined and in accordance with policies
established by the EOC Director.
EOC Section Coordinators
In addition to the Management Section, the EOC has four functional sections with
coordinators for the EOC’s Operations Support, Plans/Intelligence, Logistics, and
2‐12Page 26 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Finance/Administration Sections. These Sections are described further in Section 3: EOC
Sections.
2.2.5 Departments/Department Operations Centers (DOCs)
In an emergency, the primary responsibilities of a City department are:
1) Maintain internal department operations (continuity of operations)
2) Maintain and share operational status of department resources (staff, equipment, supplies
and facilities) at all times. This includes the status of staff members, facilities, equipment and
supplies. Departments perform this tracking as part of day-to-day operations, and in
emergency/event response, they are additionally responsible for making that information
available to the MAC System.
3) When necessary, contribute to citywide response through communication and coordination
with the EOC.
In order to accomplish these activities in an emergency/event, a Department Director or designee
may choose to establish a Department Operations Center (DOC) to coordinate department
operations. A department is not required to establish a DOC; however, each department must
perform its three primary responsibilities resources at all times.
Per SEMS, a DOC should provide for the five primary SEMS functions of Management, Operations,
Plans/Intelligence, Logistics, and Finance/Administration. Depending on situation needs and
department capabilities, the five functions may be performed by a single person, a few people, or a
highly-structured DOC organization with sections, branches and units.
2‐13Page 27 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
EOC-Department/DOC Connections
All City departments may utilize the DOC structure to coordinate department operations. DOCs can
be activated with or without an associated EOC activation.
If the EOC is activated, all departments must coordinate with the EOC. If the department is leading
implementation of an Emergency Support Function (see Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support
Functions), the department must staff associated department representative(s) in the EOC per the
table below. These EOC representatives will connect the department to citywide operations.

2.3 Emergency Management Coordination
This section outlines the Emergency Support Functions that organize Berkeley’s EOC operations,
as well as the levels of coordination and communication in Berkeley’s MAC System. This section
outlines the decision-making, resource management, and public information activities that occur at
each level and among the levels.
2.3.1 Emergency Support Functions
As utilized by the City of Berkeley, an Emergency Support Function (ESF) represents a function-
specific grouping of activities needed during emergency/event response. Berkeley adopted the
federal ESF concept and tailored it to create Berkeley-specific ESFs, which will be used to
coordinate and organize Berkeley’s Local Government Level operations.
Berkeley’s ESFs are organized as follows:
1. Transportation
2. Communications
3. Public Works and Engineering
4. Fire and Rescue
5. Emergency Management
6. Mass Care and Recovery Support
7. Logistics
8. Public Health and Medical Services
9. Urban Search and Rescue
10. Oil and Hazardous Materials Response
11. Animal Response
12. Utilities
13. Law Enforcement
14. Long-Term Recovery
15. Public Information
16. Evacuation
17. Community Support
Appropriate Departments or EOC branches will be charged with the “coordinating” responsibility for
each ESF. If activities under the ESF are primarily the responsibility of one department (e.g., ESF
13: Law Enforcement) then that department will coordinate the ESF (in this case, the Police
Department). If activities under the ESF rest among multiple departments (e.g., ESF 16: Evacuation
or ESF 6: Mass Care and Recovery Support), they will be coordinated in the EOC by the section or
branch staffed with representatives of those departments. Other EOC branches and departments
may support the coordinating department or EOC section/branch. A single department or EOC
section/branch may be involved in more than one ESF.
ESF roles and responsibilities are further detailed in the ESF Annexes to this EOP, which are
outlined in Attachment 2. Section 3: EOC Sections outlines ESF coordinating/supporting
assignments for particular EOC sections/branches.
2.3.2 Levels of Coordination and Communication
This section describes coordination and communication between the various levels of the MAC
System, from the Field Level through the Local Government Level to the OA Level EOC.
The figure below illustrates the possible communication pathways among all levels of the MAC

In the graphic above and those that follow in this plan:
 SEMS Field Level organizations (Area Commands, Incident Commands and Unified
Commands) are represented in blue. This level commands emergency response personnel
and resources in the field.
 SEMS Local Government Level organizations (Departments/DOCs, the EOC, the City
Manager/DES and Policy Group, and City Council) are represented in black. This level
manages and coordinates Berkeley’s overall emergency response and recovery activities.
 SEMS Operational Area Level organizations (ALCO OA EOC) are represented in green.
The ALCO OA EOC manages and coordinates information, resources, and priorities among
local governments within Alameda County.
The graphic above illustrates how the EOC acts as a hub between all layers of Berkeley’s MAC
System. The EOC can connect directly with Incident Commands and/or Unified Commands, and/or
additional layers may be activated as follows:
 Departments/DOCs provide an additional layer of coordination at the Local Government

for action planning, resource management and public information.
2.3.3 Information Management
The MAC System is designed to facilitate information-sharing among all of its levels. Information-
sharing facilitates effective decision-making at both the Local Government and Field Levels.
The EOC and Departments/DOCs are activated to provide decision-makers with awareness of the
entire situation. The EOC also provides information to the City Manager/DES and Policy Group to
enable the City Manager/DES to make informed policy decisions. This situational awareness is vital
to the effective coordination of support for responders in the Field Level. The EOC also facilitates
the development and distribution of accurate and consistent public information.
The EOC and Departments/DOCs provide information, including the City Manager/DES’s citywide
priorities and policy directives, to the Field Level. Information-sharing facilitates tactical decision-
making by incident commanders.

2.3.4 Action Planning6
Action planning is an essential SEMS-based emergency management process. Action plans are
created by each IC/UC/AC, Department/DOC and the EOC. Action plans created at each level
are coordinated with one another.
Field Level: Incident Action Plan (IAP)
At the Field Level, an IAP contains objectives reflecting the overall incident strategy and specific
tactical actions and supporting information for the next operational period. The plan may be oral
or written.
Local Government Level: EOC/Department/DOC Action Plan
The Action Plan created in the EOC or Department/DOC contains the EOC/Department/DOC’s
objectives to coordinate and support emergency/event response for a designated period. Action
Plan objectives reflect the Policy Group’s citywide priorities. The Plans/Intelligence Section is
responsible for developing the Action Plan in coordination with the other EOC sections. The
Action Plan is approved by the EOC/Department/DOC Director and shared with supporting
agencies.
The City Manager/DES and Policy Group do not create an Action Plan. Instead, the City
Manager/DES makes policy decisions and establishes directives and citywide priorities that guide
action planning at all levels of the MAC System. The EOC is responsible for sharing these
citywide priorities, decisions, and directives with the other elements of the MAC System through
the EOC Action Plan.
The figure that follows illustrates the scope of the Action Plan objectives developed by each
organization in the MAC System.

2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
2.3.5 Resource Management
SEMS defines resources as “personnel and major items of equipment, supplies, and facilities
available or potentially available for assignment to incident operations and for which status is
maintained.”7 For the purposes of this document, other resources may include funding sources, pre-
designated agreements, policies, and protocols. All levels of the MAC System work together to
locate, assign, move, use and track resources to address emergency/event needs.
Resource Management Assumptions
The following assumptions are in place:
 All City departments are responsible for maintaining information on the status of
department resources at all times. If necessary, a department should activate a DOC to
facilitate department operations and resource management. (See Section 2.2.5:
Departments/Department Operations Centers (DOCs) for details.)
 If the EOC has not been activated, departments/DOCs may request resources from
another department/DOC or citywide contract.
 When the EOC is activated:
o All City departments participating in emergency/event response should be
represented in the EOC.
o The resources of a department remain the assets of the department as well as a
shared asset of the EOC branch/section under which the department is serving in
the emergency/event response. For example, a Public Works Department
bulldozer remains the responsibility of the Department but is a shared resource
of the EOC Operations Support Section’s Construction and Engineering Branch,
where Public Works is represented.
o The MAC System will shift into Single-Point Ordering structure (see Single-Point
Ordering below). All Field Level resource requests will be routed through the EOC
Operations Support Section for confirmation before they are filled.
Single-Point Ordering
When the EOC is activated, the MAC System will use a single-point resource ordering structure.
Single-point ordering is a SEMS concept that establishes one centralized point to receive and
manage all resource requests for an emergency/event. For Berkeley’s MAC System, that single
point will be the EOC Operations Support Section. This means that before assigning department
resources to an incident, departments/DOCs must confirm deployment of the resource with their
representative in the EOC Operations Support Section.
Single-point ordering enables centralized coordination, tracking, and allocation of resources. By
centralizing resource requests in the EOC, the EOC Operations Support Section ensures that
department resources are being allocated to the highest-priority incidents, per the citywide priorities
established by the City Manager/DES.
Single-point ordering will not change communication between departments/DOCs and their
AC/ICP/UCPs. Additionally, even if an AC/ICP/UCP is communicating directly with the EOC
Operations Support Section, the Section will first attempt to fill resource requests through the
appropriate department(s)/DOC(s), and if unsuccessful, will forward the request to the EOC
Logistics Section.
Mutual Aid
7 California Statewide Multi‐Agency Coordination System Guide, February 2013, p. 50
2‐24Page 38 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Mutual Aid agreements are department-specific resources. If the EOC is not activated,
departments/DOCs will initiate mutual aid requests through their own discipline-specific mutual aid
agreements.
When the EOC is activated, departments/DOCs will continue to initiate mutual aid requests through
their own discipline-specific mutual aid agreements, with two additional steps for coordination and
tracking:
1) Prior to making a mutual aid request, a departments/DOC will confirm the request with
its representative in the EOC Operations Support Section
2) In the event that the department/DOC needs additional resources in support of invoking
mutual aid, the department/DOC can submit resource requests to its representative in
the EOC Operations Support Section.
Resource Management Roles and Responsibilities
The table below summarizes the respective resource management roles of the City Manager/DES,
EOC, department/DOC, Area Command and Incident Command/Unified Command.
All resource management activities are performed in accordance with the citywide priorities and
policy directives established by the City Manager/DES, as well as with the objectives established for
each SEMS organizational level/function.
Management Structure Resource Management Role
City Manager/DES  Establishes citywide priorities to guide resource
management throughout the MAC System

Resource Requesting Process
Field Level commanders submit resource requests to the appropriate Department/DOC or to the
EOC Operations Support Section, if authorized by the Department/DOC.
When a Department/DOC receives the request, it will determine if the request can be filled with
department resources.
 If the Department/DOC can fill the request, the Department/DOC will confirm resource
deployment with the EOC Operations Support Section before filling the request.
 If the Department/DOC cannot fill the request, the Department/DOC will forward the request
to the EOC Operations Support Section.
Discipline-specific mutual aid (e.g., fire service and rescue, law enforcement, and medical health)
will be handled by the appropriate department/DOC, in coordination with the appropriate
representative in the EOC Operations Support Section as outlined in Section 4: Mutual Aid.
When the EOC Operations Support Section receives the request (from a Department/DOC or
directly from the Field Level), the Section will verify that the resource is not available from within City
inventories, by checking with:
1) Department representatives in the Operations Support Section, which will check with their
Department/DOCs if necessary
2) Plans/Intelligence Section Resource Status Unit (which will maintain information for other
City departments not represented in the Operations Support Section)
When no internal source exists to fulfill the resource request, or when a shortage is anticipated, the
Operations Support Section will forward the request to the EOC Logistics Section.
The EOC Logistics Section will attempt to fulfill the request through the following methods:
 Locating inventories from known sources, including nongovernmental organizations
 Acquisition through renting, leasing or purchasing from established vendors
 Acquisition from alternate vendors
When the Logistics Section cannot fill a resource request, the Logistics Section will route the
resource request to the Logistics Section at the ALCO OA EOC.
Resource Mission Tasking
A Resource Mission Tasking is a necessary action identified by the EOC Operations Support Section
to fulfill an operational objective, which involves the dispatching of personnel outfitted with the
appropriate supplies and equipment to complete a task or assignment. This differs from a resource
request, which is used to order resources such as supplies, equipment, facilities, and personnel in
support of and supervised by those responsible for operational objectives and assigned tasks. The
EOC Operations Support Section must only submit specific resource requests to the EOC Logistics
Section. The Logistics Section does not fill Mission Tasks.
The graphic below outlines the flow of a single resource request through Berkeley’s MAC System.

Resource Tracking Roles and Responsibilities
Real-time tracking of incidents and resources is critical during the response phase. Resources may
be in short supply, and multiple requests for limited resources can occur. EOC sections and
departments/DOCs coordinate their resource management activities to provide a citywide
assessment of resource allocation and shortfalls, as outlined in the table below.
Management Structure Resource Tracking Role
EOC  Tracks resources assigned to the Field Level
Operations Support o City resources
Section o External resources
 Tracks information from departments/DOCs about available
City resources
 Tracks resource requests sent to the Logistics Section
EOC  Gathers information about assigned/available/requested
Plans/ Intelligence resources from:
Section o Operations Support Section
Resource Status Unit o Departments/DOCs not represented in EOC
Operations Support Section
o Logistics Section
 Uses available information to project resource shortfalls
EOC  Tracks resource requests received from the Operations
Logistics Section Support Section

o Department resources (equipment, materials and
personnel):
 Assigned to incidents
 Available for assignment
 Unavailable
o Discipline-specific mutual aid resource requests
 Forwards information to:

activated), or
o Plans/Intelligence Section Situation Status Unit
2‐30Page 44 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
2.3.6 Levels of Public Information Coordination and Dissemination
Significant, large-scale emergencies/events require accurate, coordinated and timely public
information. This plan distinguishes between ESF 15: Public Information and emergency public
information and warning:
 Public Information: providing accurate, coordinated, timely, and accessible information to
affected audiences, including governments, media, the private sector, and the Berkeley
community overall. Examples of public information messages include updates on citywide
response and notifications of shelter openings.
 Emergency Public Information and Warning (EPIW): disseminating life-safety instructions to
affected populations during emergencies. Examples of EPIW messages include evacuation
and shelter-in-place orders.
Because of the extremely time-sensitive nature and life safety content of EPIW messages, delivery
of EPIW messages will be handled by the EOC Operations Support Section as outlined in Section
3: EOC Sections. Public information messages will use the vetting and distribution process outlined
below.
Berkeley will coordinate its public information efforts among all levels of the MAC System. The City
may have individual Public Information Officers in the Field Level and at the EOC. The following
describes the coordination and the public information dissemination roles throughout Berkeley’s
MAC System.

2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Local Government Level: EOC
 The Operations Support Section receives site-specific information from the Field Level and
sends citywide talking points to the Field Level.
 The Plans/Intelligence Section gathers and shares intelligence with the EOC and PIO/JIC to
help develop public information messages and delivery strategy.
 A Joint Information Center (JIC) may be established to coordinate public information. A JIC
is a central location where PIOs involved in an emergency/event may co-locate to gather,
verify, coordinate, and disseminate emergency/event information.
o Receives information from EOC Section Coordinators and Management Section
o Coordinates dissemination of information internally to ensure that all involved City of
Berkeley Departments and the EOC are kept informed of messages being released
by the EOC PIO/JIC

2.4 MAC System Coordination with Other Entities
This section outlines how Berkeley’s MAC System integrates and coordinates with external
partners. When appropriate, partner representatives are integrated directly into Berkley’s MAC
System at the Local Government and/or Field Levels. Otherwise, the MAC System will
coordinate with Partners at the Local Government Level through the Liaison Officer at the EOC.
Particular considerations for each type of external partner are outlined below.
2.4.1 Alameda County – Operational Area Emergency Operations Center
The City EOC will communicate and coordinate directly with the ALCO OA EOC. ALCO OA
coordination with cities in Alameda County is outlined in the Alameda County Emergency
Operations Plan. The Alameda County EOP provides a framework for the County to coordinate
response activities of its cities, special districts and unincorporated areas. Coordination between
the City of Berkeley EOC and the ALCO OA EOC will occur through the appropriate SEMS
channels (Management, Plans/Intelligence, Operations Support, Logistics and
Finance/Administration).
2.4.2 State and Federal Organizations
In some instances, a federal or State agency will have a Field Level response role, due to its
jurisdictional responsibility of the emergency/event. For example, the Federal Aviation
Administration will have jurisdictional responsibility for an aircraft accident within Berkeley.
When a federal or State agency is involved in Field Level operations, the agency will also coordinate
with the City EOC and any appropriate Department/DOCs. Federal or State agencies operating in
the Field Level may be found in any ICS section, or as part of a Unified Command. The
emergency/event type will determine their location and scope of involvement.
2.4.3 Special Districts
The emergency response roles of special districts and governmental institutions in Berkeley are
generally focused on their normal services or functional area of responsibility. Examples of special
districts include: East Bay Municipal Utility District, AC Transit and Bay Area Rapid Transit.
Special districts will establish their own response systems. They will coordinate directly with the City
either by sending a representative to the EOC or appropriate Department/DOC, or by establishing
communications with the EOC section/branch or Department/DOC coordinating the associated ESF
(see Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support Functions). Special districts with a pre-established role
during an emergency/event will coordinate with the pre-designated EOC section/branch or
Department/DOC. Special districts without pre-established responsibilities during an
emergency/event will coordinate first with the EOC Liaison Officer and then, if appropriate, with a
designated EOC section/branch or Department/DOC.
Note: In emergencies/events with regional impacts, special districts may not have adequate staff to
send representatives to the City EOC or Department/DOCs. In this case, special district
representatives may only be available through their own operations centers or the ALCO OA EOC.
In this case, the City would coordinate with special district representatives either through their own
operations centers or through the representative at the ALCO OA EOC.
2.4.4 Non-City Governmental Institutions in Berkeley
Non-City governmental institutions in Berkeley include the University of California – Berkeley, the
Berkeley Unified School District, and the Berkeley Lab. These institutions in Berkeley generally
2‐33Page 47 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
participate in Berkeley’s MAC System in two ways:
1) Supporting Berkeley community members affiliated with their institutions (e.g., staff and/or
students)
2) Providing resources to assist with the citywide response effort (e.g., transportation, facilities,
personnel, etc.)
These institutions will establish their own response systems. They will coordinate directly with the
City either by sending a representative to the EOC or appropriate Department/DOC, or by
establishing communications with the EOC section/branch or Department/DOC coordinating the
associated ESF (see Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support Functions). Institutions with a pre-
established role during an emergency/event will coordinate with the pre-designated EOC
section/branch or Department/DOC. Institutions without pre-established responsibilities during an
emergency/event will coordinate first with the EOC Liaison Officer and then, if appropriate, with a
designated EOC section/branch or Department/DOC.
For resource requesting, non-City governmental institutions are considered to be part of the Berkeley
community and will be expected to coordinate their resource requests through City government
channels. Institutions with a pre-established role during an emergency/event in Berkeley will send
resource requests through the pre-designated Department/DOC or EOC branch. Institutions without
pre-established responsibilities during an emergency/event in Berkeley will send resource requests
through with the City EOC’s Liaison officer until directed otherwise.
2.4.5 Volunteer Organizations
The City EOC coordinates with non-governmental volunteer organizations that have response roles
within City. Some of the major volunteer organizations that may be involved in Berkeley’s MAC
System include the following:
 American Red Cross: By congressional mandate and in accordance with its corporate policy,
the Red Cross has a longstanding disaster relief mission. The Red Cross will work with the
City to provide mass care and recovery support services to all Berkeley community
members. The Red Cross will coordinate with the City at Field Level mass care sites. If
possible, the Red Cross will also provide staffing to the EOC Mass Care Branch. Otherwise,
the Berkeley MAC System Local Government Level will coordinate with the Red Cross
through the ALCO OA EOC.
 Community Emergency Response Team: The Community Emergency Response Team
(CERT) program trains Berkeley community members to be self-sufficient in an earthquake
by building teams of volunteers trained in basic emergency skills. CERT volunteers may
conduct initial search and rescue and basic first aid. CERT volunteers are trained to
communicate and participate in emergency response efforts. CERT Teams will
communicate with the EOC through the Operations Support Section’s Community Branch.
 Northern Alameda County Amateur Radio Emergency Services/Radio Amateur Civil
Emergency Services (NALCO ARES): NALCO ARES members provide civil emergency
communication services. NALCO ARES is represented in the EOC Logistics Section.
2.4.6 Private Sector Involvement
The emergency response roles of private sector organizations are generally focused on their normal
services or functional area of responsibility.
Private sector organizations will establish their own response systems. They will coordinate directly
with the City either by sending a representative to the EOC or appropriate Department/DOC, or by
establishing communications with the EOC section/branch or Department/DOC coordinating the
2‐34Page 48 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
associated ESF (see Section 2.3.1: Emergency Support Functions). Private sector organizations
with a pre-established role during an emergency/event will coordinate with the pre-designated EOC
section/branch or Department/DOC. Private sector organizations without pre-established
responsibilities during an emergency/event will coordinate first with the EOC Liaison Officer and
then, if appropriate, with a designated EOC section/branch or Department/DOC.
Examples of private sector organizations include, but are not limited to: Pacific Gas & Electric, Bayer,
and Wareham.

2.5 EOC Standard Operating Procedures
This section describes standard procedures for EOC site selection, EOC activation and EOC staff
mobilization. It also outlines communication systems that will be used by the EOC, and procedure
for After Action Reporting.
2.5.1 EOC Location and Alternate Site
Per SEMS guidelines, the EOC facility should be capable of activation within one hour and should
be able to maintain full operational status under all emergency conditions. EOC readiness is
primarily the responsibility of the Fire Department – Office of Emergency Services.
The primary EOC is located at the City of Berkeley’s Public Safety Building, at 2100 Martin Luther
King, Jr. Way. If this EOC site is not operable, the EOC will be relocated to the alternate EOC site,
at the Fire Department Division of Training, at 997 Cedar Street. Relocation to the alternate EOC
site may be considered when any of (but not limited to) the following situations are encountered at
the primary EOC site:
 Structural or non-structural damage making the building unsafe or uninhabitable
 Loss of power, water, phone service, or other utilities
 Toxic or hazardous material releases in the building or neighborhood presenting a safety
hazard to occupants
 Presence of a significant security threat
 EOC operations during a disaster significantly exceed available space
The EOC Director, in consultation with Field Level personnel commanding an incident that may
impact the EOC site, is responsible for determining if/when relocation of the EOC is necessary.
2.5.2 EOC Activation and Deactivation Procedures
EOC Activation Levels
EOC activation levels and procedures are scalable based on the changing needs of an
emergency/event. An activation level is defined as an organization’s readiness to carry out its
mission during an emergency. The City EOC may be activated to Level 1 (Situation
Monitoring), Level 2 (Partial Activation), or Level 3 (Full Activation) according to the needs of
the emergency/event.
The table below identifies the three EOC activation levels and provides examples of potential
events for each.
 Examples in this table are not guidelines or directives for EOC activation. The activation
level for each event will be dependent upon the specific situation and needs.
 The Minimum Staffing column indicates the positions that should be staffed for each
activation level. Depending on event needs, EOC staff may serve in-person at the
EOC, on call away from the EOC, or in a combination of the two during a particular
staffing rotation.
2‐36Page 50 of 108

 Major city or regional emergency Three:  All EOC positions
 Major earthquake Full
 Wildland fire in the Hills areas Activation
Note: The Policy Group is an advisory body comprised of City and external officials. The City
Manager/DES can convene the group with or without an EOC activation.
Activation Authorities
The City Manager or his/her designee may activate the EOC during any situation where the
need for EOC coordination is evident. Additionally, any senior city official or department head
may contact the City Manager to request EOC activation. Such requests should be related to the
facilitation of interdepartmental coordination for the purposes of managing an emergency. If the
EOC mission is unclear or if such a response need is not clearly evident, the City Manager may
request Policy Group input prior to authorizing an EOC activation.
Additionally, if a department director recognizes a need for EOC activation during pre-event
planning, (s)he may submit an activation request to the City Manager for consideration. Examples
of planned events may include, but are not limited to: protests, demonstrations, parades, and
political, sporting and/or holiday events.
In any circumstance when interdepartmental coordination is necessary and the City Manager is
unavailable for consultation, activation authority may also extend to the City’s:
 Fire Department Duty Chief or above
 Police Department Watch Commander or above
 Director of the Department of Public Works
 Director of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services
 Director of the Department of Parks, Recreation and Waterfront
 Health Officer
 Building Official
2‐37Page 51 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Notification and Mobilization
If the EOC is activated, the City’s Communications Center staff will use an automated notification
system to mobilize EOC staff as necessary per the activation level. As backup, the City maintains
contact lists for all EOC staff.
Individual departments are responsible for maintaining procedures to call staff back for DOC
activations or Field Level response activities.
EOC Deactivation Overview
The EOC will be deactivated or the activation level will be lowered as required by the needs of
the situation. Deactivation or change in activation level may also occur as a result of a transition
of the EOC mission from response to recovery. The City Manager/DES may change EOC
activation status based on the recommendation of the EOC Coordinator, who will consult with the
Management Section and Section Coordinators.
Prior to EOC deactivation or a change in activation level, all demobilization responsibilities and
remaining activities will be completed or transferred to the appropriate City departments.
2.5.3 Communications Systems
The EOC is equipped with a wide variety of communications systems in addition to the
public dial network (phone and Internet access). The systems provide alternate modes of
communications to City departments and support agencies and to a broad range of County,
State and other agencies. In addition to radio-based communications, the EOC has several
satellite phones for use if local circuits are busy or disrupted. Currently, the City maintains
alternate systems for emergency communications.
2.5.4 After Action Reporting
Fire-OES is responsible for conducting the After Action Report process. The purpose of an
After Action Report is to analyze response efforts, identify strengths to be maintained and built
upon, identify potential areas for further improvement, and to support the development of
corrective actions.
2‐38Page 52 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Section 3: EOC Sections
3.1 Introduction
In addition to the EOC Management Section discussed in Section 2.2.4, the EOC is
organized into Four Functional Sections: Operations Support, Plans/Intelligence, Logistics,
and Finance/Administration. Each section has a designated section coordinator, and if
activated, branch coordinator(s) and unit coordinator(s).1
Sections 3.2 – 3.5 detail for each of the Four Functional Sections:
 Section leadership, indicating the Section’s leadership positions and the
department(s) that can staff each position
 Section organization, including the branch(es) and unit(s) that can be activated in
the section and the department(s), divisions and/or external partners that can staff
each position
 The section’s role in Berkeley’s EOC, and the other organizational elements of the
MAC System that coordinate with the section
 The section’s responsibilities in information-sharing, resource management and
coordinating/supporting Emergency Support Functions (ESFs)
The chart that follows illustrates the EOC sections and the branches and units that can be
activated for each.
1 Per 2009 SEMS Guidelines (Part I‐C, System Description – Local Government Level p. 5), the position title
"coordinator" refers to the supervisor of each of the organizational elements in the EOC. The term coordinator is
used in lieu of “chief,” “director,” or other ICS terminology because the role of EOC elements is to coordinate.

Section 4: Mutual Aid
Under the terms of California’s Disaster and Civil Defense Master Mutual Aid Agreement, Statewide
emergency assistance is provided on a voluntary basis from one jurisdiction to another at no cost to
the receiving jurisdiction. Mutual aid is intended to ensure that adequate resources, facilities, and
other emergency support are provided to jurisdictions
whenever their own resources prove to be
inadequate to cope with a given situation.
To facilitate coordination and flow of mutual aid, Cal
OES oversees six mutual aid regions among the
three administrative regions, as shown in the figure at
right. The City of Berkeley is located in Mutual Aid
Region II within the Cal OES Coastal Region.
4.1 Mutual Aid Systems
The California Mutual Aid System operates within the
framework of the Master Mutual Aid Agreement and
under the authority of the California Emergency
Services Act. The system is a formal process
designed to mobilize resources to and from
emergency response agencies, local governments,
OAs, regions, and the State with the intent to provide
requesting agencies with sufficient resources.
4.1.1 California Master Mutual Aid
Systems
California’s master mutual aid systems are discipline-specific, and include Fire Service and Rescue,
Law Enforcement, Emergency Services and Medical/Health Services as shown in the table below.

4.1.2 Fire Service and Rescue Mutual Aid System
1 California Emergency Medical Services Authority
2 For the purposes of this plan, the term Emergency Services Mutual Aid also refers to non‐discipline‐specific mutual
aid.
4‐1Page 94 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
The Fire Service and Rescue Mutual Aid System is designed to coordinate the mobilization,
organization, and operation of necessary fire and rescue resources on a local, OA, regional, and
statewide basis in order to mitigate the effects of disasters. The day-to-day operations of the Fire
Service and Rescue Mutual Aid System are managed by the Cal OES Fire and Rescue Branch. For
additional information regarding this system’s organization, responsibilities, and procedures, refer to
the California Fire Service and Rescue Emergency Mutual Aid System, Mutual Aid Plan.
4.1.3 Law Enforcement Mutual Aid System
Maintained by the Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch, the Law Enforcement Mutual Aid System is an
ongoing cooperative effort among law enforcement agencies to coordinate State resources in support
of local law enforcement during a wide range of emergencies. Law enforcement mutual aid is
coordinated through seven mutual aid regions in California. Additional information on procedures,
concepts, and state agency roles and resources within the system is available in the California Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan.
4.1.4 Emergency Services Mutual Aid System
The Emergency Services Mutual Aid System is also known as non-discipline-specific mutual aid,
encompassing all other mutual aid that is not included in other systems.
 The Emergency Managers Mutual Aid (EMMA) is a sub-system that provides emergency
management personnel from unaffected areas to support disaster operations in affected
jurisdictions. Further information on EMMA can be found in the Emergency Managers Mutual
Aid Plan.
 The Safety Assessment Program (SAP) is a sub-system that utilizes volunteers and mutual
aid resources to provide professional engineers and architects and certified building
inspectors to assist local governments in safety evaluation of their built environment in the
aftermath of a disaster. Further information on SAP can be found in the Post-Disaster Safety
Assessment Program: Guideline to the Activation and Utilization of Program Resources
(March 2015).
Requests are coordinated and met through utilization of the Standardized Emergency Management
System (SEMS).
4.1.5 Medical/Health Mutual Aid System
The California Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA) administers the Medical/Health Mutual
Aid System. The purpose of the system is to identify, attain, and mobilize medical supplies and
personnel from unaffected regions of the state to meet the needs of disaster victims. The coordination
and acquisition of Medical/Health Mutual Aid resources involves federal, State, and local agencies as
well as the private sector (hospitals, medical supply vendors, ambulance companies, etc).
The figure that follows is from the State of California Emergency Plan (July 2009). It illustrates the
flow of the four mutual aid channels and how they are coordinated at each SEMS level.
4‐2Page 95 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
Discipline-Specific Mutual Aid Systems
4.2 Mutual Aid Coordination
To facilitate mutual aid, mutual aid coordinators are designated at the OA, regional, and State levels.
The basic role of a mutual aid coordinator is to receive requests, coordinate the provision of resources
from within the coordinator's geographic area of responsibility, and pass on unfilled requests to the
next level.
Representatives at Berkeley’s DOCs and/or the EOC Operations Section will work with discipline-
specific Mutual Aid Coordinators at the ALCO OA. Mutual aid requests that do not fall into one of the
discipline-specific mutual aid systems will be handled through normal emergency services resource
requesting processes, as outlined in Section 2.3.5 Resource Management.
4.3 Non-Governmental Organizations, Special Districts, and
Private Sector Organizations Mutual Aid
The involvement of NGOs, special districts, and private sector organizations with City of Berkeley
mutual aid will vary according to the resources that may be made available and the types of resources
needed. Some organizations may use internally-established mutual aid systems/arrangements in
order to acquire needed resources. For example, the American Red Cross will utilize the American
Red Cross Disaster Operations Human Resources System (DOHR) when a disaster response
4‐3Page 96 of 108
2016 City of Berkeley Emergency Operations Plan
requires greater resourcing than can be provided from the local district.
Resource needs that cannot be met through internal means will be requested through the California
Mutual Aid System at the appropriate SEMS level. Organizations with extensive involvement in
emergency response, such as the American Red Cross, may be represented in the City of Berkeley
EOC or at an appropriate DOC. Other organizations may be asked to provide a representative to the
EOC or a DOC if further collaboration is needed.

Many individuals contributed their skills and expertise to the development of this protocol. Special
appreciation goes to Kristin Littel, who served as the primary writer and researcher for the protocol. We
would also like to thank the Office for Victims of Crime for initiating this project and for providing feedback
and guidance throughout the drafting process. We are grateful to all of the women and men who gave their
time and energy to attend the focus groups, participate in the conference calls, and review numerous drafts
of the protocol; their efforts greatly enhanced the final product. We are particularly grateful for the assistance
of Gail Burns Smith who, in addition to participating in focus groups and conference calls and submitting
insightful comments on drafts, also was responsible for suggesting and organizing conference calls with
victims to ensure the victim-centeredness of the protocol.
iiiForeword
Sexual violence continues to plague our Nation and destroy lives. All members of society are vulnerable to
this crime, regardless of race, age, gender, ability, or social standing. When sexual assault does occur,
victims deserve competent and compassionate care. This second edition of the National Protocol for Sexual
Assault Medical Forensic Examinations provides detailed guidelines for criminal justice and health care
practitioners in responding to the immediate needs of sexual assault victims. We know that effective
collection of evidence is of paramount importance to successfully prosecuting sex offenders. Just as critical
is performing sexual assault forensic exams in a sensitive, dignified, and victim-centered manner. For
individuals who experience this horrendous crime, having a positive experience with the criminal justice and
health care systems can contribute greatly to their overall healing.
As we have learned in the years since the implementation of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act,
coordinated community efforts are the best way to stop violence against women, hold offenders accountable
for their crimes, and promote victim healing and recovery. That is why this protocol was designed as a guide
for practitioners who respond to victims of sexual assault, including health care professionals, law
enforcement officers, prosecutors, interpreters, advocates, and others. Combining cutting edge response
techniques with collaboration among service providers will greatly enhance our ability to treat and support
victims as well as identify and prosecute the sex offenders. We hope that this protocol lays the foundation for
these efforts.
Since this protocol was initially released in 2004, the “state of the art” for forensic medical examinations has
improved. This revised edition of the protocol has the same emphasis and values as the original but has
been updated to reflect current technology and practice. It has also been updated to include additional
information reflecting changes from the Violence Against Women Act of 2005. It also includes minor
technical changes identified in May, 2013.

viiiGoals of the National Protocol for Sexual Assault
Medical Forensic Examinations
Sexual assault is a crime of violence against a person’s body and will. Sex offenders use physical and/or
psychological aggression or coercion to victimize, in the process often threatening a victim’s sense of
privacy, safety, autonomy, and well-being. Sexual assault can result in physical trauma and significant
mental anguish and suffering for victims. In some communities, sexual violence is considered a form of
oppression. Victims may be reluctant, however, to report the assault to law enforcement and to seek medical
attention for a variety of reasons. For example, victims may blame themselves for the sexual assault and feel
embarrassed. They may fear their assailants or worry about whether they will be believed. Victims may also
lack the ability or emotional strength to access services. For example, they may not have their own
transportation or access to public transportation. They may also not speak English well or fear that reporting
the assault may jeopardize their immigration status.1 They may lack health insurance and believe it would be
too costly to get the medical care they need. They may not be aware that as a crime victim, they are eligible
for financial reimbursements for certain services. Their budgets may not allow them to pay out-of-pocket
expenses and then await reimbursements. Those who do have access to services may perceive the medical
forensic examination as yet another violation because of its extensive and intrusive nature in the immediate
aftermath of the assault. Rather than seek assistance, a sexual assault victim may simply want to go
somewhere safe, clean up, and try to forget the assault ever happened.2 It is our hope that this protocol will
help jurisdictions in their efforts to respond to sexual assault victims in the most competent, compassionate,
and understanding manner possible.
This protocol was developed with the input of national, local, and tribal experts throughout the country,
including law enforcement representatives, prosecutors, advocates, medical personnel, forensic scientists,
and others. We hope that this protocol will be useful in helping jurisdictions develop a response that is
sensitive to victims of sexual assault and that promotes offender accountability. Specifically, the protocol has
the following goals:
 Supplement, but not supersede, the many excellent protocols that have been developed by states,
tribes, and local jurisdictions, as well as those created at the national level. We hope that this
protocol will be a useful tool for jurisdictions wishing to develop new protocols or revise their existing
ones. It is intended as a guideline for suggested practices rather than a list of requirements. In
many places, the protocol refers to “jurisdictional policies” because there may be multiple valid ways
to handle a particular issue and which one is best should be determined by the jurisdiction after
consideration of local laws, policies, practices, and needs.
 Provide guidance to jurisdictions on responding to adult and adolescent victims. Adolescents are
distinguished in the protocol from prepubertal children who require a pediatric exam. Pediatric
exams are not addressed in this document. This protocol generally focuses on the
examination of females who have experienced the onset of menarche and males who have
reached puberty. Legally, jurisdictions vary in the age at which they consider individuals to be
minors, laws on child sexual abuse, mandatory reporting policies for sexual abuse and assault of
minors, instances when minors can consent to treatment and evidence collection without
parental/guardian involvement, and the scope of confidentiality that minors are afforded. If the
adolescent victim is a minor under the jurisdictional laws, the laws of the jurisdiction
governing issues such as consent to the exam, mandatory reporting, and confidentiality
should be followed.
• Support the use of coordinated community responses to sexual violence, such as Sexual Assault
Response Teams (SARTs) or Sexual Assault Response and Resource Teams (SARRTs). Although

1this document is directed primarily toward medical personnel and facilities, it also provides guidance
to other key responders such as advocates and law enforcement representatives. This type of
coordinated community response is supported by the Violence Against Women Act and subsequent
legislation. Such a response can help afford victims access to comprehensive immediate care,
minimize the trauma victims may experience, and encourage them to utilize community resources. It
can also facilitate the criminal investigation and prosecution, increasing the likelihood of holding
offenders accountable and preventing further sexual assaults.
 Address the needs of victims while promoting the criminal justice system response. Stabilizing,
treating, providing social and legal services, including knowledge of immigration protections, and
engaging victims as essential partners in the criminal investigation are central aspects of the
protocol. Thus, this protocol includes information about concepts such as “anonymous reporting,”
which may give victims needed time to decide if and when they are ready to engage in the criminal
justice process. An anonymous report may also provide law enforcement agencies with potentially
useful information about sex crime patterns in their jurisdictions.3 The objective is to promote better
and more victim-centered4 evidence collection, in order to provide better assistance in court
proceedings and hold more offenders accountable.
 Promote high-quality, sensitive, and supportive exams for all victims, regardless of jurisdiction and
geographical location of service provision. The protocol offers recommendations to help standardize
the quality of care for sexual assault victims throughout the country and is based on the latest
scientific evidence. It also promotes timely evidence collection that is accurately and methodically
gathered, so that high-quality evidence is available in court.
This protocol discusses the roles of the following responders: health care providers, advocates, law
enforcement representatives, forensic scientists, and prosecutors, as well as interpreters. Clearly, each of
these professions has a distinct and complementary role in responding to sexual assault. But rather than
dictate who is responsible for every component of the response or within the exam process, the protocol is
designed to help communities consider what each procedure involves and any related issues. With this
information, each community can make decisions for its jurisdiction about the specific tasks of each
responder during the exam process and the coordination needed among responders. The following is a
general description of the responsibilities with which each responder may assist:5
• Advocates may be involved in initial victim contact (via 24-hour hotline or face-to-face meetings);
offer victims advocacy, support, crisis intervention, information, language assistance services,
including interpreters, and referrals before, during, and after the exam process; and help ensure that
victims have transportation to and from the exam site. They often provide comprehensive, longer
term services designed to aid victims in addressing any needs related to the assault, including but
not limited to counseling, legal (civil, criminal, and immigration), and medical system advocacy.
• Law enforcement representatives (e.g., 911 dispatchers, patrol officers, officers who process
crime scene evidence, detectives, and investigators) respond to initial complaints, work to enhance
victims’ safety, arrange for victims’ transportation to and from the exam site as needed, interview
victims in a language they understand, collect evidence from the scene, coordinate collection and
delivery of evidence to designated labs or law enforcement facilities, interview suspects, and conduct
other investigative activities (such as interviewing suspects and witnesses in a language they
3 States are responsible for ensuring that the costs associated with performing a medical forensic examination are paid and ensuring
that all victims of sexual assault are provided the opportunity to have a medical forensic examination conducted, regardless of whether
they choose to participate in the criminal justice system.
4 Please see the section on “Victim-Centered Care” beginning on page 29 for more explanation of this term.
5 There are instances where a case may be prosecuted concurrently in two or more jurisdictions. For example, sexual assault cases
occurring on Indian reservations can be prosecuted concurrently in tribal and state or federal court. In such situations, each sovereign
will likely have its own victims’ advocate, law enforcement, prosecutor, and judicial/court officers. Coordination of services in
multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions is critical to the success of the criminal case and the well-being and healing of the
victim.
2understand, requesting crime lab analyses, reviewing medical and lab reports, preparing and
executing search and arrest warrants, writing reports, and presenting the case to a prosecutor).
• Health care providers assess patients for acute medical needs and provide stabilization, treatment,
and/or consultation. Ideally, sexual assault forensic examiners perform the medical forensic exam,
gather information for the medical forensic history, collect and document forensic evidence, and
document pertinent physical findings from patients. They offer information, treatment, and referrals
for sexually transmitted infections (STIs),6 and other nonacute medical concerns; assess pregnancy
risk and discuss treatment options with the patient, including reproductive health services; and testify
in court if needed. They coordinate with advocates to ensure patients are offered crisis intervention,
support, and advocacy before, during, and after the exam process and encourage use of other victim
services. They may follow up with patients for medical and forensic purposes. Other health care
personnel who may be involved include, but are not limited to, emergency medical technicians, staff
at hospital emergency departments, gynecologists, surgeons, private physicians, health care
interpreters, and/or local, tribal, campus, or military health services personnel.
• Forensic scientists analyze forensic evidence and provide results of the analysis to investigators
and/or prosecutors. They also may testify at trial regarding the results of their analysis.
• Prosecutors determine if there is sufficient evidence for prosecution and, if so, prosecute the case.
They should be available to consult with first responders as needed. A few jurisdictions involve
prosecutors more actively, paging them after initial contact and having them respond to the exam
site so that they can become familiar with the case and help guide the investigation.
This document is intended only to improve the criminal justice system’s response to victims of
sexual assault and the sexual assault forensic examination process. It does not address the
remedies that may be available to victims through the civil justice system, and does not create a right
or benefit, substantive or procedural, for any party.
6 STIs are also commonly known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
3Recommendations at a Glance: A National Protocol for
Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations
The National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations offers guidance to jurisdictions in
creating and implementing their own protocols, as well as recommending specific procedures related to the
exam process. Recommendations at a Glance highlights key points discussed in the protocol, but it is not
designed to be a stand-alone checklist on exam procedures or responsibilities of each involved responder.
The protocol should be read to understand and respond to the complex issues presented during the exam
process. See the protocol introduction for an explanation of select terms used in this chapter and the
protocol.
Goal of the Protocol
A timely, high-quality medical forensic examination can potentially validate and address sexual assault
patients’7 concerns, minimize the trauma they may experience, and promote their healing. At the same time,
it can increase the likelihood that evidence collected will aid in criminal case investigation, resulting in
perpetrators being held accountable and further sexual violence prevented.
The examination and the related responsibilities of health care personnel are the focus of this protocol.
Recognizing that multidisciplinary coordination is vital to the success of the exam, the protocol also
discusses the responses of other professionals, as they relate to the exam process.
A. Overarching Issues
1. Coordinated approach: A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to conducting the exam provides victims8
with access to comprehensive immediate care, helps minimize trauma they may experience, and
encourages their use of community resources. Such a response can also enhance public safety by
facilitating investigation and prosecution, which increases the likelihood that offenders will be held
accountable for their actions. Raising public awareness about the existence and benefits of a coordinated
response to sexual assault may lead more victims to disclose the assault and seek help. (SEE PAGES 23–
29)
Recommendations for jurisdictions to facilitate a coordinated approach to the exam process:
• Understand that the purposes of the exam process are to address patients’ health care needs and
collect evidence suitable for possible use by the criminal justice system.
• Identify key responders and their roles.
• Develop quality assurance measures to ensure effective response during the exam process.
2. Victim-centered care: Victim-centered care is paramount to the success of the exam process. Response to
victims should be timely, appropriate, sensitive, and respectful. (SEE PAGES 30-45)
Recommendations for health care providers and other responders to facilitate victim-centered care:
• Give sexual assault patients priority as emergency cases.
• Provide the necessary means to ensure patient privacy.
• Adapt the exam process as needed to address the unique needs and circumstances of each patient.
7 Sexual assault patients are also referred to as victims, depending on which responders are primarily being discussed. The term
“patients” is generally used by health care professionals.
8 The term “victim” is not used in a strictly criminal justice context. The use of “victim” simply acknowledges that persons who disclose
that they have been sexually assaulted should have access to certain services.
4• Develop culturally responsive care and be aware of issues commonly faced by victims from specific
populations.
• Recognize the importance of victim services within the exam process.
• Accommodate patients’ requests to have a relative, friend, or other personal support person (e.g.,
religious and spiritual counselor/advisor/healer) present during the exam, unless considered harmful
by responders.
• Accommodate patients’ requests for responders of a specific gender throughout the exam as much
as possible.
• Prior to starting the exam and conducting each procedure, explain to patients in a language the
patients understand what is entailed and its purpose.
• Assess and respect patients’ priorities.
• Integrate medical and evidentiary procedures where possible.
• Address patients’ safety during the exam.
• Provide information that is easy for patients to understand, in the patient’s language, and that can be
reviewed at their convenience.
• Address physical comfort needs of patients prior to discharge.
3. Informed consent: Patients should understand the full nature of their consent to each exam procedure. By
presenting them with relevant information, in a language they understand, patients are in a position to make
an informed decision about whether to accept or decline a procedure. However, they should be aware of the
potential impact of declining a particular procedure, as it may negatively affect the quality of care, the
usefulness of evidence collection, and, ultimately, any criminal investigation and/or prosecution. They should
understand that declining a particular procedure might also be used against them in any justice system
proceeding. If a procedure is declined, reasons why should be documented if the patient provides such
information. (SEE PAGES 47-49)
Recommendations for health care providers and other responders to request patients’ consent during the
exam process:
• Seek the informed consent of patients as appropriate throughout the exam process.
• Make sure policies exist to guide the process of seeking informed consent from specific populations.
4. Confidentiality: Involved responders must be aware of the scope and limitations of confidentiality related to
information gathered during the exam process. Confidentiality is intricately linked to the scope of patients’
consent. Members of a sexual assault response team (SART) or other collaborating responders should
inform victims of the scope of confidentiality with each responder and be cautious not to exceed the limits of
victim consent to share information in each case. (SEE PAGES 51-53)
Recommendations that jurisdictions may take to maintain confidentiality of patients:
• Be sure jurisdictional policies address the scope and limitations of confidentiality as it relates to the
exam process and with whom information can be legally and ethically shared.
• Increase the understanding of relevant confidentiality issues. .
• Consider the impact of the federal privacy laws regarding health information on victims of sexual
assault.
• Strive to resolve intrajurisdictional conflicts.
5. Reporting to law enforcement: Reporting the crime provides the criminal justice system with the
opportunity to offer immediate protection to victims, collect evidence from all crime scenes, investigate
cases, prosecute if there is sufficient evidence, and hold offenders accountable for crimes committed. Given
the danger that sex offenders pose to the community, reporting can serve as a first step in efforts to stop
them from reoffending. Equally important, reporting gives the justice system the chance to help victims
address their needs, identify patterns of sexual violence in the jurisdiction, and educate the public about such
patterns. Service providers should discuss all reporting options with victims in a language they understand
5and the pros and cons of each, including the fact that delayed reporting may be detrimental to the
prosecution of an offender. Even if a victim does not get a forensic medical exam, the victim can still report
the crime at a later time. However, it will be much more difficult for criminal justice personnel to investigate
and prosecute the crime if evidence was not collected.
Reporting requirements in sexual assault cases vary from one jurisdiction to another. Every effort should be
made to facilitate treatment and evidence collection (if the patient agrees), regardless of whether the
decision to report has been made at the time of the exam. Victims who are undecided about reporting who
receive respectful and appropriate care and advocacy at the time of their exam are more likely to assist law
enforcement and prosecution. Because immigrant victims may be more reticent to report crimes, they need
to be aware of crime victim protections for immigrants. Access to immigration relief for crime victims will
enhance the ability of law enforcement to detect, investigate, and prosecute crimes. (SEE PAGES 55-59)
Recommendations for jurisdictions and responders to facilitate victim-centered reporting practices:
• Except in situations covered by mandatory reporting laws, patients, not health care workers, make
the decision to report a sexual assault to law enforcement.
• Inform patients about reporting consequences.
• As a result of VAWA 2005, many jurisdictions have implemented alternatives to standard reporting
procedures.
• Promote a victim-centered reporting process.
6. Payment for the examination under VAWA: Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA),9 a state,
territory, or the District of Columbia is entitled to funds under the STOP Violence Against Women Formula
Grant Program only if it, or another governmental entity, incurs the full out-of-pocket cost of medical forensic
exams for victims of sexual assault. “Full out-of-pocket costs” means any expense that may be charged to a
victim in connection with the exam for the purpose of gathering evidence of a sexual assault.10 In addition,
under the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, states may not require victims to participate in the criminal
justice system or cooperate with law enforcement in order to receive a forensic medical exam.11 (SEE
PAGES 61-62)
Recommendations for jurisdictions to facilitate payment for the sexual assault medical forensic exam:
• Understand the scope of the VAWA provisions related to exam payment.
• Notify victims of exam facility and jurisdictional policies regarding payment for medical care and the
medical forensic exam.
B. Operational Issues
1. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners: These are the health care professionals who conduct the
examination. It is critical that all examiners, regardless of their discipline, are committed to providing
compassionate and quality care for patients disclosing sexual assault, performing the physical examination,
collecting evidence competently, documenting all findings, and testifying in court as needed. (SEE PAGES
65-67)
Recommendations for jurisdictions to build the capacity of examiners performing these exams:
• Encourage the development of specific knowledge, skills, and victim-centered approaches in
examiners.
• Encourage advanced education and supervised clinical practice of examiners, as well as certification
for all examiners.
9 42 U.S.C. § 3796gg-4.
10 28 C.F.R. § 90.14(a).
11 42 U.S.C. 3796gg-4(d).
6• Provide access to experts on anti-sexual assault initiatives who can participate in sexual assault
examiner training, mentoring, proctoring, case review, photograph review, and quality assurance.
2. Facilities: Health care facilities have an obligation to provide services to sexual assault patients.
Designated exam facilities or sites served by specially educated and clinically prepared examiners increase
the likelihood of a state-of-the-art exam, enhance coordination, encourage quality control, and increase
quality of care for patients. (SEE PAGES 71-74)
Recommendations for jurisdictions to build capacity of health care facilities to respond to sexual assault
cases:
• Recognize the obligation of health care facilities to serve sexual assault patients in a culturally and
linguistically appropriate manner.
• Ensure that exams are conducted at sites served by examiners with advanced education and clinical
experience, if possible.
• Explore possibilities for optimal site locations.
• Communities may wish to consider developing basic requirements for designated exam sites.
• If a transfer from one health care facility to a designated exam site is necessary, use a protocol that
minimizes time delays and loss of evidence and addresses patients’ needs.
3. Equipment and supplies: Certain equipment and supplies are essential to the exam process (although
they may not be used in every case). These include a copy of the most current exam protocol used by the
jurisdiction, standard exam room equipment and supplies, comfort supplies for patients (e.g., changes of
clothes, food, and water), sexual assault evidence collection kits, an evidence drying device/method, a
forensic imaging system, testing and treatment supplies, a purified water source, an alternate light source, an
anoscope, and written materials for patients. A microscope and/or toluidine blue dye may be required,
depending on jurisdictional policy. A colposcope or other magnifying instrument may also be used. Some
jurisdictions are also beginning to use advanced technology (telemedicine), which allows examiners offsite
consultation with medical experts by using computers, software programs, and the Internet. Jurisdictions
using such technology should be careful to protect patient confidentiality. (SEE PAGES 75-77)
Recommendations for jurisdictions and responders to ensure that proper equipment and supplies are
available for examinations:
• Consider what equipment and supplies are necessary to conduct a medical forensic exam.
• Address cost barriers to obtaining necessary equipment and supplies.
4. Sexual assault evidence collection kit (for evidence from victims): Most jurisdictions have developed their
own sexual assault evidence collection kits or purchased premade kits through commercial vendors. Kits
often vary from one jurisdiction to another. Despite variations, however, it is critical that every kit meets or
exceeds minimum guidelines for contents: broadly including a kit container, instruction sheet and/or
checklist, forms, and materials for collecting and preserving all evidence required by the applicable crime
laboratory. Evidence that may be collected includes, but is not limited to, clothing, foreign materials on the
body, hair (including head and pubic hair samples and combings), oral and anogenital swabs and smears,
body swabs, blood and urine samples for possible alcohol and/or toxicology testing, and a blood or saliva
sample for DNA analysis and comparison. The instruction sheet and/or checklist should guide examiners on
maintaining the chain of custody for evidence collected. (SEE PAGES 79-80)
Recommendations for jurisdictions and responders when developing/customizing kits:
• Use kits that meet or exceed minimum guidelines for contents.
• Work to standardize sexual assault evidence collection kits within a jurisdiction and across a state or
territory, or for federal cases.
5. Timing considerations for collecting evidence: Although many jurisdictions have traditionally used 72 hours
after the assault as the standard cutoff time for collecting evidence, a large number of jurisdictions have
7moved toward longer time frames as cut off points. Many jurisdictions have now extended the standard cutoff
time (e.g., to 5 days or 1 week). The use of such timeframes is supported by empirical evidence. Advancing
DNA technologies continue to extend time limits because of the stability of DNA and sensitivity of testing.
These technologies are even enabling forensic scientists to analyze evidence that was previously unusable
when it was collected years ago. Thus, it is critical that in every case where patients are willing, examiners
obtain the pertinent medical forensic history, examine patients, and document findings. Not only can the
information gained from the relevant history and exam help health care providers address patients’ medical
needs, but it can guide examiners in determining whether there is evidence to collect and, if so, what to
collect. (SEE PAGES 81-82)
Recommendations for health care providers and other responders to maximize evidence collection:
• Recognize the importance of gathering information for the medical forensic history, examining
patients, and documenting exam findings, separate from collecting evidence.
• Examine patients promptly to minimize loss of evidence and identify medical needs and concerns.
• Make decisions about whether to collect evidence and what to collect on a case-by-case basis,
guided by knowledge that outside time limits for obtaining evidence vary due to factors such as the
location of the evidence or type of sample collected.
• Responders, examiners, and law enforcement representatives should seek education and resources
to aid them in making well-informed decisions about evidence collection.
6. Evidence integrity: Properly collecting, preserving, and maintaining the chain of custody of evidence is
critical to its subsequent use in criminal justice proceedings. (SEE PAGES 83-84)
Recommendations for health care providers and other responders to maintain evidence integrity:
• Follow jurisdictional policies for drying, packaging, labeling, and sealing evidence.
• Make sure transfer policies maximize evidence preservation.
• Make sure storage policies maximize evidence preservation.
• Document the handling, transfer, and storage of evidence.
C. The Examination Process
1. Initial contact: Some sexual assault patients may initially present at a designated exam facility, but most
who receive immediate medical care initially contact a law enforcement or advocacy agency for help. If 911
is called, law enforcement or emergency medical services (EMS) may be the first to provide assistance to
victims. Communities need to have procedures in place to promptly respond to disclosures/reports of sexual
assault in a standardized and victim-centered manner. (SEE PAGES 87-90)
Recommendations for jurisdictions and responders to facilitate initial contact with victims:
• Build consensus among involved agencies regarding procedures for a coordinated initial response
when a recent sexual assault is disclosed or reported. Educate responders to follow procedures
• Recognize essential elements of initial response.
2. Triage and intake: Once patients arrive at the exam site, health care personnel must evaluate, stabilize,
and treat for life-threatening and serious injuries according to facility policy. Standardized procedures for
response in these cases should be followed, while respecting patients and maximizing evidence
preservation. (SEE PAGES 91-92)
Recommendations for health care providers to facilitate triage and intake that addresses patients’ needs:
• Consider sexual assault patients a priority.
8• First perform a prompt, competent medical assessment. Then respond to acute injury, the need for
trauma care, and safety needs of patients before collecting evidence.
• Alert examiners of the need for their services.
• Contact victim advocates so they can offer services to patients, if not already done.
• Assess and respond to safety concerns upon arrival of patients at the exam site, such as threats to
patients or staff.
• Assess patients’ needs for immediate medical or mental health intervention prior to the evidentiary
exam, following facility policy.
3. Documentation by health care personnel: Examiners document exam findings, the medical forensic
history, and evidence collected in the medical forensic report. (SEE PAGE 93-94)
Recommendations for health care providers to complete needed documentation:
• Ensure completion of all appropriate documentation.
• Educate examiners on proper documentation.
• Ensure the accuracy and objectivity of medical forensic reports.
4. The medical forensic history: Examiners ask the patient questions in a language the patient understands
to obtain this history. This information guides them in examining the patient and collecting evidence. (SEE
PAGES 95-98)
Recommendations for health care providers to facilitate gathering information from patients:
• Coordinate medical forensic history taking and investigative interviewing.
• Advocates should be able to provide support and advocacy during the history, if desired by patients.
• Consider patients’ needs prior to and during information gathering.
• Obtain the medical forensic history.
5. Photography: Photographic documentation of injury or other visible evidence on the patient’s body can
supplement the medical forensic history and the written documentation of physical findings and evidence.
(SEE PAGES 99-102)
Recommendations for health care providers and other responders to photograph documentation:
• Consider the extent of forensic photography necessary.
• Consider the equipment.
• Consider patient comfort and privacy.
• Explain forensic photography procedures to patients.
• Take initial and follow-up photographs as appropriate, according to jurisdictional policy.
6. Exam and evidence collection procedures: Examiners examine patients and collect evidence according to
jurisdictional policy. Findings from the exam and collected evidence often help reconstruct the events in
question in a scientific and objective manner. (SEE PAGES 103-113)
Recommendations for health care providers to conduct the exam and facilitate evidence collection:
• Recognize the evidentiary purpose of the exam.
• Strive to collect as much evidence from patients as possible, guided by the scope of informed
consent, the medical forensic history, exam findings, and instructions in the evidence collection kit.
• Be aware of and document evidence and injuries that may be pertinent to the issue of whether the
patient consented to the sexual contact with the suspect.
• Understand how biological evidence is tested.
9• Prevent exposure to infectious materials and risk of contamination of evidence.
• Understand the implications of the presence or absence of seminal evidence.
• Modify the exam and evidence collection to address the specific needs and concerns of patients.
• Explain exam and evidence collection procedures to patients.
• Conduct the general physical and anogenital exam and document findings on body diagram forms.
• Collect evidence to submit to the crime lab for analysis, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Collect other evidence.
• Keep medical specimens separate from evidentiary specimens collected during the exam.
7. Alcohol and drug-facilitated sexual assault: Responders must consider the possibility that drugs and/or
alcohol may have been used to facilitate an assault. They must know how to screen for suspected alcohol
and drug-facilitated sexual assault, obtain informed consent of patients for testing, and collect toxicology
samples when appropriate. (SEE PAGES 114-118)
Recommendations for jurisdictions and responders to facilitate response in suspected alcohol- or drug-
facilitated sexual assault:
• Promote training and develop jurisdictional policies.
• Plan response to voluntary use of drugs and/or alcohol by patients.
• Be clear about the circumstances in which toxicology testing may be indicated. Routine testing is not
recommended.
• Toxicology testing procedures should be explained to patients.
• Toxicology samples should be collected as soon as possible after a suspected drug-facilitated case
is identified and informed consent is obtained, even if patients are undecided about reporting to law
enforcement.
• Identify toxicology laboratories.
• Preserve evidence and maintain the chain of custody.
8. Sexually transmitted infection (STI) evaluation and care: Because contracting an STI from an assailant is
of significant concern to patients, it should be addressed during the exam. (SEE PAGES 119-124)
Recommendations for health care providers to facilitate STI evaluation and care:
• Offer patients information in a language they understand.
• Consider the need for STI testing on an individual basis.
• Encourage patients to accept prophylaxis against STIs if indicated.
• Encourage follow-up STI exams, testing, immunizations, counseling, and treatment as directed.
• Address concerns about HIV infection.
9. Pregnancy risk evaluation and care: Patients may fear becoming pregnant as a result of an assault. Health
care providers must address this issue according to facility and jurisdictional policy. (SEE PAGEs 125-126)
Recommendations for health care providers to facilitate pregnancy evaluation and care:
• Discuss the probability of pregnancy with patients who have reproductive capability.
• Administer a pregnancy test for all patients with reproductive capability (with their consent).
• Discuss treatment options with patients in their preferred language.
A victim of sexual assault should be offered prophylaxis for pregnancy, subject to informed consent and
consistent with current treatment guidelines. Conscience statutes will continue to protect health care
providers who have moral or religious objections to providing certain forms of contraception. In a case in
which a provider refuses to offer certain forms of contraception for moral or religious reasons, victims of
sexual assault must receive information on how to access these services in a timely fashion.
1010. Discharge and follow-up: Health care personnel have specific tasks to accomplish before discharging
patients, as do advocates and law enforcement representatives (if involved). Responders should coordinate
discharge and follow-up activities as much as possible to reduce repetition and avoid overwhelming patients.
(SEE PAGES 129-131)
Recommendations to facilitate discharge and follow-up:
• Address issues related to medical discharge and follow-up care.
• Advocates, law enforcement representatives, and other involved responders can coordinate with
health care providers to discuss a range of other issues with patients prior to discharge.
11. Examiner court appearances: Health care providers conducting the exam should expect to be called on
to testify in court as fact and/or expert witnesses. (SEE PAGES 133-135)
Recommendations for jurisdictions to maximize the usefulness of examiner testimony in court:
• Encourage broad education for examiners on testifying in court.
• Promote prompt notification of examiners if there is a need for them to testify in court.
• Encourage pretrial preparation of examiners.
• Encourage examiners to seek feedback on testimony to improve effectiveness of future court
appearances.
11Introduction
Sexual assault is a prevalent crime in our society that has a devastating and long-term impact on individuals
from all walks of life. Although an assault can be traumatizing in and of itself, it can result in a range of
problems for the victim, such as acute and chronic mental health problems, physical injuries, pregnancy, and
sexually transmitted infections (STIs).12 It is essential that communities offer assistance to victims in the
immediate aftermath of an assault. Communities must also work to hold offenders accountable for their
actions and stop them from committing further sexual violence. Elements of response typically include the
following:
• Provision of a prompt medical screening exam and treatment, including stabilization and/or referral
for medical care for victims as needed;
• Collection of evidence from victims and documentation of findings, which may aid investigation and
prosecution;
• Responding to, documenting, and investigating sexual assault, which generally includes collection of
evidence from the scene of the sexual assault, which may lead to charges against suspects and
prosecution;
• Support, crisis counseling, information and referrals for victims, as well as advocacy to ensure that
victims receive appropriate assistance; and
• Support and information for victims’ families and friends.
This document focuses on elements of immediate response that are the responsibility of health care
providers—medical care for sexual assault patients and collection of evidence from them. It seeks to assist
health care personnel in validating and addressing patients’ health concerns, minimizing the trauma patients
may experience, promoting healing, and maximizing the collection and preservation of evidence from
patients, including documentation of findings, for potential use in the legal system. (A sexual assault medical
forensic examination as described in this document addresses both medical and evidentiary needs of the
patient following sexual assault).
This protocol also addresses the role of advocates, law enforcement representatives, prosecutors, forensic
scientists, and other responders in the medical forensic exam process. For various reasons (such as fear,
stigma, lack of information, lack of access, or mental trauma), many sexual assault victims choose not to
seek medical care or have evidence collected. However, coordination among professionals involved in
immediate response may be instrumental in reversing this trend. It is often found that victims will seek
assistance when responders work together to ensure that victims are informed of their options for assistance,
encouraged to address their needs, have their spiritual and psychological needs respected, and are aided in
obtaining the help they want. In addition, multidisciplinary coordination has proven to enhance medical care
provided to victims as well as evidence collection and preservation efforts.13
Background
This national protocol was developed by the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) under the direction of
the Attorney General pursuant to the Violence Against Women Act of 2000.14 In developing the protocol,
OVW reviewed existing protocols on sexual assault forensic examinations and consulted with national, state,
local, and tribal experts on sexual assault. Experts were consulted from rape crisis centers; state and tribal
sexual assault and domestic violence coalitions and programs; and programs for criminal justice, forensic
12 STI are also commonly known as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
13 For example, when first responders explain to victims how to preserve evidence on their bodies and clothing prior to arrival at the
exam site, they may increase the likelihood that the evidence will be collected rather than contaminated or destroyed.
14 The statutory requirement to develop this protocol can be found in Section 1405 of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, Public
Law 106-386. The statutory requirement also mandates the development of a national recommended standard for training for health
care professionals performing these examinations, as well as related training for all health care students. These training standards were
released in June, 2006 and are available at http://www.dna.gov/.

communities.15
Starting in the summer of 2001, the Department of Justice (DOJ) began gathering information on resources,
issues, and gaps related to sexual assault medical forensic exams. The first task was to identify and obtain
relevant materials and data. Existing national and jurisdictional protocols on the exam and immediate
multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault were sought,16 as well as documents that analyzed jurisdictional
response. Input was solicited on issues, gaps, and promising practices from numerous organizations,
associations, and individuals representing disciplines involved in the response to sexual assault. In addition,
numerous persons were contacted who could offer perspectives on particular issues related to the exam
process. State sexual assault coalitions and state government agencies that oversee violence against
women programs, as well as tribal coalitions, were also contacted to gain information on their activities
concerning protocol development and training. In some states, data was obtained through discussions with
sexual assault forensic examiners and coordinators of examiner programs or sexual assault response teams.
A series of forums was held in the summer and fall of 2002, calling upon practitioners and policymakers
involved in victim advocacy, health care, forensic science, and criminal justice fields to assist in developing a
national protocol. After a draft protocol for adult and adolescent victims was developed in early 2003, it was
distributed to a wide array of individuals and organizations for their review and feedback.17 Comments were
first solicited from the individuals who were invited to the forums. Then input was sought from sexual assault
survivors, as well as tribal sexual assault and domestic violence coalitions and local advocacy programs.
Members of the National Advisory Committee on Violence Against Women also reviewed the draft and
provided input. After several revisions of the document, feedback was solicited during the summer of 2003
from many national and state organizations and some local agencies that deal with sexual assault issues or
serve diverse populations, as well as other individuals representing relevant disciplines. Comments received
were incorporated into the document where appropriate.
Many of the revisions from the original protocol are based on recommendations made by the consulted
experts. Some of the recommendations are based on empirical research. Although research has been and
continues to be done in many areas related to the medical forensic exam, much more research needs to be
done to evaluate the impact of the exam process and specific exam components on victim well-being and
criminal justice outcomes. For this revision, OVW solicited input from technical assistance providers
representing the relevant disciplines, such as forensic nurses, doctors, prosecutors, law enforcement,
advocates, and civil attorneys, as well as the National Institute of Justice. We also held a webinar with
relevant experts.
The national protocol recommends, rather than mandates, methods for conducting the medical forensic
exam.18 It serves as an informational guide to communities as they develop or revise their own protocols.19 In
no way does it invalidate previously established jurisdictional protocols, policies, or practices.
About This Document
Organization. Protocol recommendations are organized into several broad sections: A) overarching issues,
B) operational issues, and C) the examination process. Each section builds on information presented in
15 Such consultation was required under Section 1405 of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, Public Law 106-386.
16 Protocols reviewed varied in scope, focus, targeted audiences, and level of detail. Most addressed to some extent exam and evidence
collection procedures, drug-facilitated assault, evidence integrity, and evaluation and care for STIs, HIV, and pregnancy. Some also
addressed roles of involved responders, multidisciplinary coordination, reporting, crime lab testing, court testimony, issues related to
victims’ needs, working with specific populations of victims, payment for the exam, and crime victims’ compensation.
17 The scope of this protocol is limited to the sexual assault medical forensic exam of adult and adolescent victims. A separate protocol
should be developed on child exams. Not only is child sexual victimization a complex topic in and of itself, but response to child victims
can be considerably different from response to adult and adolescent victims.
18 The protocol has no regulatory purpose and is not intended to nor does it provide legal advice. (Statement adapted from the Hawaii
State Sexual Assault Protocol for Forensic and Medical Examinations, Introduction, 1999.)
19 Those involved in the development of this protocol strove to create a document that addressed the many issues facing communities
across the nation related to the exam process. However, there may be instances where the document falls short of adequately
addressing specific needs or challenges facing a jurisdiction or a specific population of victims. See appendix A on customizing
protocols for ways that jurisdictions can address these limitations when they are developing/revising their own protocols.
13previous sections and comprises tasks to be addressed, issues to be considered and related
recommendations. Although an effort has been made to avoid repetition of information throughout the
document, there are instances where data are repeated for clarity or emphasis. The appendixes discuss the
topics of protocol customization by jurisdictions and creation of sexual assault response teams.
Protocol foundation. This protocol is based on a belief that it is possible, with a victim’s consent, to
simultaneously address the immediate health needs of a victim and the future needs of the justice system.
Key principles underlying response to sexual assault victims as discussed in this document include:
• Recognition of victim safety and well-being as paramount goals of response.
• Recognition that victims know far more about themselves and their needs than responders.
• Respect for victims’ right to make their own choices.
• Recognition that providing victims with information about their options during the exam process,
expected consequences of choosing one option over another, and available resources can help
them make more informed decisions.
• Recognition that all victims, regardless of differences in backgrounds and circumstances, and
regardless of their decision to report the crime or not, have the right to receive a high-quality medical
forensic exam and to be treated with respect and compassion.
• Respect for victims’ right to confidentiality.
• Recognition of the importance of victims’ feedback to improving the exam process.
Another important principle is recognition that the vast majority of sexual assaults are committed by
assailants known to victims. Historically, sexual assault committed by nonstrangers was not taken seriously
and interventions were less than adequate. It is imperative that all involved responders acknowledge that
sexual assaults committed by persons known to victims are as grave a crime as those committed by
strangers. Responders should be aware that victims’ reactions to an assault are affected by a multitude of
factors: one of them being the prior relationship between the victim and the offender. They should also
understand that many variables may affect the relevance of certain types of evidence to a particular case,
including whether an assault was committed by a stranger, a known offender who claims no sexual contact
with the victim, or a known offender who claims the victim consented to the contact.20
Use of Terms
Many terms are explained throughout the protocol to clarify the context in which they are used.21 However, it
may be helpful to discuss briefly the following terms in advance (in alphabetical order):
Adolescent: Adolescents are distinguished in the protocol from prepubertal children who require a pediatric
exam. This document focuses on the examination of females who have experienced the onset of menarche
and males who have reached puberty. However, it is important to recognize that age also plays a role in
whether a person is treated as a child or adolescent. For example, some adolescent girls may not start
menstruating until their later teen years. While the physical developmental level of these patients must be
taken into account when performing the exam, they should otherwise be treated as adolescents rather than
children. Legally, jurisdictions vary in the age at which they consider individuals to be minors, laws on child
sexual abuse, mandatory reporting policies for sexual abuse and assault of minors, instances in which
minors can consent to treatment and evidence collection without parental/guardian involvement, and the
scope of confidentiality that minors are afforded. Involved responders should be well versed in their
jurisdictional laws and policies regarding the above issues, screening procedures for determining whether a
pediatric exam is needed (particularly in the case of younger adolescents), and local protocols for response
to prepubertal victims. Exam sites are to follow the jurisdictional laws regarding parental/guardian consent.
20 For example, evidence that identifies a suspect in a stranger case, such as DNA evidence, is critical to the continuing investigation. In
cases in which the victim knows the suspect, evidence that identifies suspects is important if suspects claim they had no sexual contact
with victims. In cases in which suspects claim that victims consented to the sexual contact, evidence identifying suspects is less crucial
and evidence and documentation related to whether force or coercion was used against victims is often more important.
21 Keep in mind that these definitions may vary from those used generally or in exam protocols developed by states, territories, tribes,
and local communities.
14Communitywide sexual assault coordinating councils: These multidisciplinary groups typically work to
facilitate a communitywide response to sexual assault that is appropriate, coordinated, and comprehensive.
They tend not to be involved in direct response, but rather endeavor to improve overall services,
interventions, and prevention efforts. Communitywide coordinating council is a broad term for such a group,
but possibilities are endless for what a jurisdiction may call such a group. This group may be a subcommittee
of an entity that more generally promotes coordinated response to violence in the community.
Coordinated community response: This term refers to immediate and longer term community response to
sexual assault that is coordinated among involved responders. The idea is that while each responder
provides services and/or interventions according to agency-specific policies, they also work with responders
from other agencies and disciplines to ensure that they coordinate responses. The desired result is a
collective response to victims and offenders that is appropriate, streamlined, and as comprehensive as
possible. Coordinated community response to sexual assault is a concept that developed out of a need to
reduce the historically fragmented approach to these cases and the negative impact of fragmentation on
victim well-being, offender accountability, and prevention of future assault. These community responses may
be known as sexual assault response teams or sexual assault response and resource teams (SARTs or
SARRTs).
Culture: This term refers to a body of learned beliefs, traditions, and guides for behaving and interpreting
behavior that may be shared among members of a particular group. Aspects of a culture include its values,
beliefs, customs, communication styles, behaviors, practices, and institutions.22 In this document, a cultural
group refers not only to an ethnic, racial, or religious group, but also to other groups with distinct cultures
such as senior citizen; Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities; populations with differing sexual orientations,
gender identities, or gender expressions; immigrants; refugees; the homeless; military personnel and their
dependents; adolescents; prison inmates; and victims of sex trafficking or victims of commercial sexual
exploitation. Individuals often belong to multiple cultural groups.
An immediate response to victims should sensitively and appropriately address their related cultural needs
and concerns. It is important that responders acknowledge that victims from certain cultures in a community
may be underserved, unserved, or misserved by the systems responsible for response and should work to
improve response to these populations.
Disability: A person with a disability is an individual who has a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one of more of that individual’s major life activities, who has a record of such impairment,
or is regarded as having such impairment.
Major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,
hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,
concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working. A major life activity also may include the operation of
major bodily functions, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth,
digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.
An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major
life activity in order to be considered a disability. Determining whether an impairment substantially limits a
major life activity is done without regard to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. Mitigating
measures include medication, medical supplies, equipment, appliances, prosthetics, hearing aids and
cochlear implants, mobility devices, oxygen therapy equipment, use of assistive technology, and learned
behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.
An impairment that substantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities in order
to be considered a disability. An impairment that is episodic or in remission is a disability if it would
substantially limit a major life activity when active.
22 The first two sentences in this paragraph are drawn from A. Blue, The Provision of Culturally Competent Health Care, from the Web
site of the Medical University of South Carolina College of Medicine
(http://academicdepartments.musc.edu/fm_ruralclerkship/curriculum/culture.htm).
15An individual is “regarded as” a person with a disability if that individual is discriminated against because of
an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment, whether or not the impairment limits a major life
activity.
Domestic violence: This term broadly refers to any abusive and coercive behavior used to control an intimate
partner (a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, or former spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend) and/or a family member.23
Some examples of tactics employed by abusers to control victims are use of coercion, threats, and
intimidation; emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; economic manipulation; use of privilege; use of children
and pets; isolation of victims; minimization and denial of violence; and blaming victims for violence.24 An
episode of domestic violence often includes multiple actions, and the violence typically escalates over time.
In this protocol, it is important to be aware that sexual assault can be a significant part of domestic violence.
Response to sexual assault occurring within a domestic violence context requires understanding of the
overlapping dynamics of sexual assault and domestic violence, the complex needs of victims, the potential
dangerousness of offenders, the resources available for victims, and adherence to jurisdictional policies on
response to domestic violence.
Exam site: Emergency health care facilities, such as those in hospitals, traditionally have been the setting for
provision of medical forensic services to sexual assault patients. However, nonemergency health care
programs, such as hospital-based or community-based examiner programs, community clinics, mobile health
clinics, tribal health clinics, local health departments, military hospitals or clinics, and college and university
health centers, may also offer full or partial sexual assault medical forensic services. Sexual assault forensic
examiners also may conduct exams at additional health care and non-health care sites. The facility
conducting the exam may be referred to in this protocol as the “exam site,” in recognition of the fact that not
all sites performing the exam are health care facilities. Clinical staff providing care at exam sites are broadly
referred to in this document as “health care providers,” ”health care staff,” “health care personnel,” and
“health care clinicians.” In some communities, forensic exams may be conducted by lay health care
providers, community health aides, or others who have been trained to perform forensic exams.
Examiner: The term refers to the health care provider conducting the sexual assault medical forensic
examination. The examiner is also referred to in this document as the “sexual assault forensic examiner,”
“sexual assault examiner,” and “forensic examiner.” Many communities refer to their sexual assault
examiners by more specific acronyms based upon the discipline of practitioners and/or specialized education
and clinical experiences.
First responder: A first responder is a professional who initially responds to a disclosure of a sexual assault
(there is often more than one first responder). These professionals typically must follow agency-specific
policies for responding to victims. Those who traditionally have been responsible for immediate response to
adult and adolescent sexual assaults include victim advocates, 911 dispatchers, law enforcement
representatives, and health care providers. A wide range of other responders also may be involved, such as
emergency medical technicians, public safety officials, protective service workers, prosecutors and
victim/witness staff, private physicians, staff from local health care facilities, mental health providers, social
service workers, corrections and probation staff, religious and spiritual counselors/advisors/leaders, school
personnel, employers, qualified interpreters, and providers from organizations that address needs of specific
populations (e.g., persons with disabilities, racial and cultural groups, senior citizens, the poor and homeless,
runaways and adolescents in foster care, and domestic violence victims). Families and friends of victims also
can play an important role in the initial response, because victims may first disclose the assault to them, ask
for their help in seeking professional assistance, and want their ongoing support. However, they are not
considered first responders in this document, because they are not responding to these disclosures in an
official capacity.
Forensic scientist: The forensic scientist is responsible for analyzing evidence in sexual assault cases. This
evidence typically includes DNA and other biological evidence, toxicology samples, latent prints, and trace
evidence. Some forensic scientists specialize in the analysis of specific types of evidence. In this protocol,
forensic scientists working in jurisdictional crime laboratories are often referred to as “crime lab/laboratory
23 Drawn from M.A. Dutton, “The Dynamics of Domestic Violence: Understanding the Response from Battered Women,” Florida Bar
Journal 68(9), January 24, 1994.
24 Drawn from the Power and Control Wheel developed by the Domestic Violence Intervention Project of Minnesota.
16personnel” and “crime lab/laboratory scientists.” Forensic scientists analyzing drug and alcohol samples are
also referred to as “toxicologists.” Forensic scientists in many communities may respond to crime scenes to
collect evidence and to process the scene.
Jurisdiction: This term is used in two ways in the protocol. One is to broadly describe a community that has
power to govern or legislate for itself. For example, a jurisdiction may be a local area, a state, a territory, or
tribe. A jurisdiction may also be referred to in the protocol as a “community.” The term also describes the
authority to interpret and apply laws and is used in this context mainly when identifying who has “jurisdiction”
over a particular case.
Language assistance services (LAS): Language assistance services are oral language services for
interpretation and written language services, translation of written materials into languages other than
English for limited English proficient (LEP) individuals.
Law enforcement representative: Different types of law enforcement agencies exist at the local, state,
territory, tribal, and federal levels (e.g., state, county, tribal, or local police or sheriff, sworn police on college
campuses, the FBI, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and military police). Any of these agencies could
potentially be involved in responding to sexual assault cases. Also, in areas without a local law enforcement
agency, public safety officials may assist in immediate response to sexual assault victims. Some agencies
may have staff with specialized education and experience in sexual assault investigations, which may be
dedicated to investigating sexual assault cases and/or may be part of a special unit for investigating sexual
assaults. In this protocol, personnel from law enforcement agencies are referred to as “law enforcement
officers” or “law enforcement representatives,” unless more specificity is required.
Limited English Proficient (LEP): Refers to individuals who do not speak English as their primary language
and have a limited ability read, speak, write, or understand English. LEP individuals may be entitled to
language assistance services to ensure they have meaningful access to a benefit, program, or service that
receives federal financial assistance.
Prosecutor: Different types of prosecution offices exist at the local, tribal, state, territory, and federal level
(e.g., tribal prosecutor’s office, county prosecutor’s office, district attorney’s office, state attorney’s office,
United States Attorney’s office, and military judicial branches). Any of these offices could be involved in
responding to sexual assault cases. In addition, some offices may have personnel with specialized education
and experience in sexual assault prosecutions, who may be dedicated to prosecuting sexual assault cases
and/or may be part of a special unit for prosecuting sexual assaults. In this protocol, attorneys from
prosecution offices will be referred to as “prosecutors” unless more specificity is required.
Sexual assault: Generally speaking, sexual assault is the sexual contact of one person with another without
appropriate legal consent. This definition includes, but is not limited to, a wide range of behavior classified by
state, territory, federal, and tribal law as rape, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, and sexual battery. Refer
to applicable statutes for precise definitions in a specific jurisdiction.25
Sexual assault medical forensic examination: The sexual assault medical forensic exam is an examination of
a sexual assault patient by a health care provider, ideally one who has specialized education and clinical
experience in the collection of forensic evidence and treatment of these patients. The examination includes
gathering information from the patient for the medical forensic history; an examination; coordinating
treatment of injuries, documentation of biological and physical findings, and collection of evidence from the
patient; documentation of findings; information, treatment, and referrals for STIs, pregnancy, suicidal
ideation, alcohol and substance abuse, and other nonacute medical concerns; and follow-up as needed to
provide additional healing, treatment, or collection of evidence. This exam is referred to as the “forensic
medical examination” under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
Sexual assault response team (SART) also called a sexual assault response and resource team (SARRT): A
SART/SARRT is a multidisciplinary team that provides specialized immediate response to victims of recent
25 Drawn from the American College of Emergency Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually Assaulted or Sexually
Abused Patient, 1999, Overview, p. 7.
17sexual assault. The team typically includes health care personnel, law enforcement representatives, victim
advocates, prosecutors (usually available on-call to consult with first responders, although some may be
more actively involved at this stage), and forensic lab personnel (typically available to consult with
examiners, law enforcement, or prosecutors, but not actively involved at this stage). However, SART/SARRT
components vary by community. The term “SARRT” (written with two “R”s) stands for “Sexual Assault
Response and Resource Team.” This term is used for communities that involve a wider array of agencies
and disciplines in their collaborative effort. A SARRT (with two “R”s) will thus involve all of the first
responders who are typically included in a SART (with one “R”), but it may also include professionals who
coordinate services for victims beyond the immediate response (e.g., representatives from mental health,
public health, substance abuse treatment, and other social services). Many of these SARRTs meet monthly
and often engage in systems review to ensure that the best victim-centered services are being provided in
their communities.
Suspected sex offender: A suspected sex offender is an individual suspected of committing a sexual assault.
In this document, the suspected sex offender is typically referred to as a “suspect.” When litigation is
discussed, the suspected sex offender may be referred to as a “defendant.” When talking more broadly
about sex offenders, they may be referred to as “sex offenders,” “assailants,” or “perpetrators.”
Victim: A sexual assault victim is someone who has been sexually assaulted. In this document, a victim can
be a female or male; a person whose gender identity may not conform to his or her sex, or may be someone
who doesn’t identify as either male or female; either adult or adolescent. There may be instances where
individuals, such as unconscious persons or persons with cognitive disabilities, do not actually disclose that
they have been assaulted, but others suspect that this may be this case and may be lawfully able to seek
help for them. The term “survivor” is used in this document when referring to victims who are involved in
long-term healing or have healed from sexual assault. It is important to note that because this document
addresses a multidisciplinary response, the term “victim” is not used in a strictly criminal justice context. The
use of “victim” simply acknowledges that persons who disclose they have been sexually assaulted should
have access to certain services and interventions designed to help them be safe, recover, and seek justice.
The term “patient” is also used when discussing the role of medical providers.
Victim service provider/advocate: A victim service provider/sexual assault victim advocate (also referred to
as “victim advocate” and “advocate”) may offer victims and their significant others a range of services during,
and following, the exam process. These services may include support, crisis intervention, information and
referrals, interpretation or translation, and advocacy to ensure those victims’ interests are represented, their
wishes respected, and their rights upheld. In addition, advocates and other victim service providers may
provide follow-up services, such as support groups, counseling, accompaniment to related appointments,
and legal advocacy (civil, criminal, and immigration) to help meet the needs of victims, their families, and
friends.
A number of agencies may offer some or all of the services described above, including community-based
sexual assault victim advocacy programs,26 criminal justice system victim-witness offices, patient advocate
programs at health care facilities, campus or military victim service programs, tribal social services, adult
protective services, and others. Where they exist, community-based sexual assault victim advocacy
programs are typically best positioned to provide these specific services. Community-based advocacy
programs may use paid and/or volunteer advocates to provide services 24 hours a day, every day of the
year. It is important to know that information victims share with government-based service providers usually
becomes part of the criminal justice record, while community-based advocates typically can provide some
level of confidential communication for victims. In addition, community-based advocates commonly receive
education specific to the medical forensic exam process and sexual assault issues in general.
Victim-centered: A “victim-centered” approach as used in this protocol recognizes that sexual assault victims
are central participants in the medical forensic exam process, and they deserve timely, compassionate,
respectful, and appropriate care. Victims have the right to be fully informed in order to make their own
decisions about participation in all components of the exam process. Responders need to do all that is
26 In some areas, the community-based sexual assault victim advocacy program is a component of an umbrella organization serving
additional populations (e.g., a dual sexual assault/domestic violence advocacy agency, a center for women, or a mental health agency).
In others, the community-based sexual assault victim advocacy program is a stand-alone organization.
18possible to explain possible options, the consequences of choosing one option over another, and available
resources, as well as support victims in their choices. Medical personnel may refer to this as “patient-
centered care.”
Vulnerable adults: This term is used in this document to refer to adult individuals with impaired and/or
reduced mental capacity who have difficulty or cannot comprehend events that occurred or will occur (e.g.,
the assault itself or initial response by professionals), questions they will be asked during the exam, or the
exam process itself. Exam sites should have internal policies based on jurisdictional statutes governing
consent for treatment for and evidence collection from such patients.
1920A. Overarching Issues
This section presents issues that impact all or most of the sexual assault medical forensic exam
process. The following chapters are included:
• Coordinated Team Approach
• Victim-Centered Care
• Informed Consent
• Confidentiality
• Reporting to Law Enforcement
• Payment for the Examination Under VAWA
21221. Coordinated Team Approach
Recommendations at a glance for jurisdictions to facilitate a coordinated team approach:
• Understand that the purpose of the exam is to address patients’ health care needs and collect evidence
when appropriate for potential use within the criminal justice system.
• Identify key responders and their roles.
• Develop quality assurance measures to ensure effective response during the exam process.
Communities should ensure that victims, regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances, have access to
medical, legal, and advocacy services. Use of a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach in conducting the
medical forensic examination can afford victims access to comprehensive immediate care, help minimize
trauma they may be experiencing, and encourage the use of community resources. Such a response can
also enhance public safety by facilitating investigation and prosecution, thereby increasing the likelihood that
offenders will be held accountable for their behavior and further sexual assaults will be prevented. Raising
public awareness about the existence and benefits of a coordinated response to sexual assault may lead
more victims to disclose the assault and seek the help they need.27
Understand that the purpose of the exam is to address patients’ health care needs and collect
evidence when appropriate for potential use within the criminal justice system. The medical/forensic
examination in its entirety addresses the medical and evidentiary needs of the consenting patient:
• Conducting prompt examinations.
• Providing support, crisis intervention, and advocacy.
• Obtaining a history of the assault.
• Performing a complete assessment.
• Documenting exam findings.
• Evaluating and treating injuries.
• Properly collecting, handling, and preserving potential evidence.
• Providing information, treatment, and referrals for STIs and pregnancy.
• Providing follow-up care for medical and emotional needs as well as further forensic evaluation.
• Providing language assistance services for limited English proficient, Deaf and hard-of-hearing
individuals, and those with sensory or communication disabilities.
It is also possible that examiners may provide the following as a routine part of their post-examination
process depending upon the criminal justice system response:
• Interpreting and analyzing examination findings.
• Presenting findings and providing factual and/or expert opinion related to the medical forensic
examination.
Coordination among involved disciplines is strongly recommended to simultaneously address the needs of
both victims and the justice system. Ensuring that victims’ needs are met often can increase their level of
comfort and involvement with the legal system.
Identify key responders and their roles. Two types of teams are recommended to facilitate a coordinated
community response to sexual assault. Some form of a sexual assault response team (SART/SARRT) is
useful to coordinate immediate interventions and services, including victim support, medical care, evidence
collection and documentation, and the initial criminal investigation. A communitywide coordinating group
(often called a “council”) can help promote efforts to improve comprehensive response to sexual violence,
27 This paragraph is drawn partially from American College of Emergency Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually
Assaulted or Sexually Abused Patient, 1999, p. 7.
23including prevention education and outreach,28 training and technical assistance, improvement of victim
services, protocol development, public policy advocacy, dissemination of materials, and evaluation of the
effectiveness of these efforts.29 A communitywide coordinating council may also oversee activities of a
SART/SARRT. Military bases, school campuses, and tribes may develop coordinating councils or SARTs or
SARRTs of their own to allow for a more specialized response tailored to the needs of their populations.
Coordinating councils may also exist to encourage consistent responses across a state, territory, tribal land
or region.
SART/SARRT membership. A SART/SARRT is composed of professionals involved in immediate response
to disclosures of sexual assault. A core SART/SARRT commonly includes health care providers, law
enforcement representatives, and victim advocates. Prosecutors and forensic scientists also are often
involved, but more as consultants than first responders. Civil attorneys who represent victims are sometimes
involved as well. Broad roles for SART/SARRT members include (listed in alphabetical order):30
• Advocates may be involved in initial victim contact (via 24-hour hotline or face-to-face meetings),
offer victim advocacy, support, crisis intervention, information, translation or interpretation, and
referrals before, during, and after the exam process, and facilitate transportation for the victim to and
from the exam site. They often provide comprehensive, longer term services designed to aid victims
in addressing any needs related to the assault, including but not limited to counseling and legal (civil,
criminal, and immigration) and medical systems advocacy.
• Civil attorneys protect the interests of sexual assault victims, address concerns that affect
immediate everyday life and long-term wellbeing of victims, and represent victims in civil legal
matters. Civil legal matters may include: privacy, safety, immigration, education, housing,
employment, and financial issues. Because civil attorneys represent the individual victim, and not
the prosecutor, they play a very different role from that of the prosecutor.
• Forensic scientists analyze forensic evidence and provide results of the analysis to investigators
and/or prosecutors. They may respond to crime scenes to assist in the collection and processing of
evidence. They also testify at trial regarding the results of their analysis.
• Health care providers assess patients for acute medical needs and provide stabilization, treatment,
and/or consultation. Ideally, sexual assault forensic examiners perform the medical forensic exam,
gather information for the medical forensic history, collect and document forensic evidence, and
document pertinent physical findings from patients. They offer information, treatment, and referrals
for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, and other nonacute medical concerns. They
may also testify in court if needed. They coordinate with advocates to ensure that patients are
offered crisis intervention, support, and advocacy during and after the exam process and encourage
use of other victim services. They may follow up with patients for medical and forensic purposes.
Other health care personnel that may be involved include, but are not limited to, emergency medical
technicians, staff at hospital emergency departments, gynecologists, surgeons, private physicians,
and/or local, tribal, campus, or military health services personnel.
• Law enforcement representatives (e.g., 911 dispatchers, patrol officers, officers who process
crime scene evidence, investigators, and federal law enforcement officers) respond to initial
complaints, work to enhance victims’ safety, arrange for victims’ transportation to and from the exam
site as needed, interview victims, coordinate collection and delivery of evidence to designated labs or
law enforcement property facilities, and investigate cases (e.g., interviewing suspects and witnesses,
requesting crime lab analysis, reviewing medical and lab reports, preparing and executing search
warrants, writing reports, and presenting the case to a prosecutor).
• Prosecutors determine if there is sufficient evidence for prosecution and, if so, prosecute the case.
They should be available to consult with first responders as needed. A few jurisdictions more actively
28 Although victim advocacy programs and coordinating councils often lead local prevention efforts, SARTs play a role in prevention by
helping victims plan for their safety and well-being and connecting them with resources that may reduce the likelihood of their future
revictimization (e.g., emergency shelters and longer term housing programs, protective orders, programs offering free cell phones that
automatically dial 911 when activated, or businesses that can help change locks and install alarm systems). Initial evidence collection
and investigative efforts can play a pivotal role in holding offenders accountable and preventing them from reoffending.

24involve prosecutors, paging them after initial contact and having them respond to the exam site so
that they can become familiar with the case and help guide the investigation.31
• Victims' rights attorneys ensure victims’ rights are upheld during the criminal justice process.
Examples in the sexual assault cases include independent motions to quash subpoenas filed in the
criminal case (e.g., subpoenas for counseling, medical, educational, and employment records),
independent rape shield arguments, motions to close courtrooms or limit media access, and motions
for alternative means of testifying and/or support during testifying.
Each responder should be able to explain to victims the roles of other team members. Depending on the
case and jurisdictional policies, other professionals or agencies - from perhaps multiple jurisdictions - may
also be involved in immediate interventions and service provision. They need information about the
SART/SARRT and its procedures to guide their responses and facilitate coordination of activities with the
SART/SARRT. SART/SARRT members also need information about those professionals and agencies, their
roles in sexual assault response, and how to contact and interact with them.
Team efforts are enhanced when SART/SARRT members reflect the communities being served. At the least,
SART/SARRT members should strive to understand the needs and concerns of specific populations living in
the area served. SART/SARRTs should reach out to agencies that serve these populations so that team
members can promptly access their services if needed.
See Appendix B for more information on the creation of SARTs/SARRTs.
Membership of a coordinating council. A coordinating council typically comprises a wide array of
professionals and citizens who develop the community’s response to sexual assault. Organizations with an
interest in or a responsibility for sexual assault victims should be considered for membership.32 For example,
members might include33 victim advocates; legal services providers (civil, criminal, and immigration);
survivors of sexual assault and their families and friends; health care workers; public health and safety
officials; law enforcement personnel; prosecutors; victim/witness staff; judicial personnel;34 corrections and
probation staff; sex offender treatment providers; forensic lab personnel; staff from mental health agencies;
personnel serving persons with disabilities; substance abuse treatment staff, staff from residential living
settings such as nursing homes, assisted living programs, and group homes; educators from all levels;
legislators and government policymakers; exam site administrators; religious and spiritual leaders; and the
media and business community. Representation from all levels of government that potentially have
jurisdiction over these cases in the area served should be involved. Equally important are members who can
address the needs of diverse populations in the community (e.g., racial and cultural groups, senior citizens,
persons with disabilities, immigrants, the poor and homeless, runaways and adolescents in foster care,
domestic violence victims, college students, military personnel and dependents, and populations with
differing sexual orientations and gender identities or expressions). Agencies that provide qualified
interpreters in sexual assault cases should also be invited to participate.
Attempting to involve all agencies and individuals listed above is an enormous task and could prove to be a
barrier to council formation and initial council efforts. Therefore, communities should make their own
decisions about which stakeholders are critical to initial efforts and form a core membership, and then
31 In addition to seeking prosecution of offenders, victims who attend institutions of higher education may have the option of filing
disciplinary charges. When that happens, members of the judiciary board review the case to decide if the institutional code of conduct
has been violated and, if so, to determine sanctions. Tribes may also have their own codes related to sexual assault and/or processes
through which victims can seek remedies, beyond what is available through state or federal prosecution.

Abused Patient, 1999, p. 19.
34 Judges’ conduct in and out of the courtroom is governed by a code of judicial conduct that requires that they do nothing that would
give the appearance of partiality. Depending on local interpretation of the code, the participation of judicial personnel on a council should
not negate their ability to be impartial in court. In the unlikely instance that the council is involved with individual cases, judges can
excuse themselves from those activities.
25identify which agencies and individuals would be useful to have at the table at some point but are not
essential to getting started.35
Develop quality assurance measures to ensure effective response during the exam process. Involved
agencies should have mechanisms to ensure that the quality of discipline-specific response and coordinated
response is optimal. Some tools to ensure consistent high-quality response by involved professionals include
training, ongoing education, supervision, periodic performance evaluations, and peer reviews (e.g., medical
forensic reports). Also useful in facilitating improvements to immediate response are feedback from victims
and involved professionals and collection and analysis of data from the exam process (as discussed below).
Review of both active and resolved cases provides many opportunities to improve the performance of
individual team members and the team as a whole, although certain team members, such as community
based advocates, may need to be careful about confidentiality in case discussions.
Obtain feedback on victim impact, the exam process, and criminal justice outcomes. All involved responders
can benefit from victims’ feedback about whether they felt response to the crime was adequate and if
anything could have been done to improve response or better address their needs. It can be useful to talk
with victims about their experiences during the exam process, including the location of the exam, and explore
how the process might be changed to better minimize trauma. Victim feedback can be obtained in several
ways: by requesting completion of an evaluation form (not immediately after the exam), conducting a follow-
up phone survey, and inviting participation in focus group discussions. It is important to solicit feedback from
diverse populations in the community (e.g., racial and cultural groups, senior citizens, persons with
disabilities, persons with limited English proficiency, immigrants, the poor and homeless, runaways and
adolescents in foster care, domestic violence victims, college students, military personnel and dependents,
and populations with differing sexual orientations and gender identities). Ask victims prior to medical
discharge if they will allow such subsequent contacts and the best method of contacting them. Responders
should be careful to ask victims for a safe manner to contact them, particularly in situations involving sexual
assault by intimate partners. Advocates can help design a victim feedback system that is sensitive, does not
harm victims, and has mechanisms to quickly link victims with appropriate victim services if needed. Families
and friends of victims may also be able to provide useful feedback.
Obtaining feedback from and facilitating dialogue among the first responders (law enforcement, advocate,
medical personnel) to the sexual assault and the individual who conducted the exam is also critical. Some of
this information could be routinely solicited and discussed at SART/SARRT meetings and jurisdictional
sexual assault coordinating council meetings (to assess what works and what needs improvement). Also,
periodic evaluation of the exam process by examiners, medical supervisors/examiner program directors,
advocates, law enforcement representatives, and prosecutors can help ensure that victims’ needs are
addressed, problems are resolved, cutting-edge practices and technologies are utilized as much as possible,
and training needs are identified. In terms of getting feedback on how the exam process impacts criminal
justice outcomes, examiners can benefit from access to crime lab reports on evidence collected and
feedback from crime lab personnel about improving their evidence collection techniques. Prosecutors can
provide examiners and law enforcement representatives with information about the usefulness of evidence
collected in case prosecution. Advocates can encourage discussion on how the exam process can affect
victims’ interest in and willingness to be involved in the criminal justice system. Law enforcement
representatives and other first responders can discuss with examiners and crime lab personnel optimal
methods to preserve evidence from victims prior to their arrival at the exam site. Again, review of both active
and resolved cases by the team as a whole is a rich opportunity for improvement These are but a few
examples of how first responders could use feedback on criminal justice outcomes to improve the exam
process.
Consider collecting and analyzing data from the exam process to better understand the nature of assaults in
the community and evaluate effectiveness of responses. (Information that identifies victims should not be
35 The protocol does not further explore issues related to more comprehensive coordinated response to sexual assault. However, one
useful resource for communities interested in the development of a multidisciplinary response is the National Center for Victims of
Crime’s Looking Back, Moving Forward: A Guidebook for Communities Responding to Sexual Assault.
26included in collected data. Attention must be given to protecting victims’ identity in communities where
residents tend to know one another or word of a crime travels quickly). Over time, such data may help to: 36
• Track the participation of involved responders, agencies, and facilities.
• Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of agency and coordinated responses.
• Assess the effectiveness of response in different types of cases (e.g., stranger assaults versus
nonstranger assaults).
• Improve the quality of the examination.
• Evaluate the impact of the collected evidence on criminal justice outcomes.
• Track and evaluate victim service outcomes.
Some jurisdictions have developed centralized databases to collect and analyze information across
disciplines. However, such a venture requires significant resources, coordination, and thought
regarding how to maintain victims’ confidentiality. Coordination can be particularly challenging in
communities where cross-jurisdictional issues arise frequently (e.g., in tribal lands). A centralized database
may be more easily accomplished if it is built into multidisciplinary coordination planning. For example,
involved agencies can together determine how to utilize existing resources, seek new funding, maintain
victims’ privacy, and systematically obtain data. Jurisdictions considering such databases should take into
consideration the fact that pooling empirical data (such as patient age, Zip Code, or use of a weapon) is
likely to be reliable while use of pooled interpretive data(such as blunt cervical trauma or findings of
strangulations) is risky and may be unreliable because of uncontrollable variables in examiner training and
experience.

27282. Victim-Centered Care
Recommendations at a glance for health care providers and other responders to facilitate victim-centered
care during the exam process:
• Give sexual assault patients priority as emergency cases.
• Provide the necessary means to ensure patient privacy.
• Adapt the exam process as needed to address the unique needs and circumstances of each patient.
• Develop culturally responsive care and be aware of issues commonly faced by victims from specific
populations.
• Recognize the importance of victim services within the exam process.
• Accommodate patients’ requests to have a relative, friend, or other personal support person (e.g.,
religious -and spiritual counselor/advisor/healer) present during the exam, unless considered harmful by
responders.
• Accommodate patients’ requests for responders of a specific gender throughout the exam as much as
possible.
• Prior to starting the exam and conducting each procedure, explain to patients in a language the patients
understand what is entailed and its purpose.
• Assess and respect patients’ priorities.
• Integrate medical and evidentiary procedures where possible.
• Address patients’ safety during the exam.
• Provide information that is easy for patients to understand, in the patient’s language, and that can be
reviewed at their convenience.
• Address physical comfort needs of patients prior to discharge.
It is critical to respond to individuals disclosing sexual assault in a timely, appropriate, sensitive, and
respectful way.37 Every action taken by responders during the exam process should be useful in facilitating
patient care and healing and/or the investigation (if the case was reported).
Give sexual assault patients priority as emergency cases. This includes a prompt medical screening
exam. Recognize that every minute patients spend waiting to be examined may cause loss of evidence and
undue trauma. Individuals disclosing a recent sexual assault should be quickly transported to the exam site,
promptly evaluated, treated for serious injuries, and offered a medical forensic exam. (For more discussion
on this topic, see C.2. Triage and Intake.) Have plans for what to do, if the examiner is not available right
away. For example, is there a quiet, private place the patient can wait? Is there a phone available so the
patient can talk to an advocate or a friend or family member while waiting? Jurisdictions should consider
policies and training for facility staff and administration regarding what to do while sexual assault patients are
waiting.
Provide the necessary means to ensure patient privacy. Exercise discretion to avoid the embarrassment
for individuals of being identified in a public setting as a sexual assault victim. Some health care facilities use
code plans to avoid inappropriate references by staff to sexual assault cases. Also, do not leave sexual
assault patients in the main waiting area at the exam site. Instead, give them as much privacy as possible
(e.g., a private treatment room and waiting area) and be cognizant of their sense of safety (e.g., do not
examine suspects in same location at the same time). Make sure that the first responding health care
providers attend to patients’ initial medical needs and arrange for an on-call advocate to offer onsite support,
crisis intervention, and advocacy. It may be useful to give patients the option of speaking with an advocate
via a 24-hour crisis hotline (if one exists) until an advocate arrives. Health care providers should provide
patients with access to a phone to contact family members and/or support persons as desired, and should
promptly contact law enforcement, if not already involved, if patients want to report the assault.
37 The chapter was partially built on information from the North Carolina Protocol for Assisting Sexual Assault Victims, 2000.
29Health care providers should explain, in a language the patients understand, the scope of confidentiality
during the exam process and during communication with advocates. (For information on this topic, see A.4.
Confidentiality.)
Adapt the exam process as needed to address the unique needs and circumstances of each patient.
Patients’ experiences during the crime and the exam process, as well as their post-assault needs, may be
affected by multiple factors, such as:
• Age.
• Gender and/or perceived gender identity/gender expression.
• Physical health history and current status.
• Mental health history and current status.
• Disability.
• Language needs for limited English proficient patients, Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and
those with sensory or communication disabilities.
• Ethnic and cultural beliefs and practices.
• Religious and spiritual beliefs and practices.
• Economic status, including homelessness.
• Immigration and refugee status.
• Sexual orientation.
• Military status.
• History of previous victimization.
• Past experience with the criminal justice system.
• Whether the assault involved drugs and/or alcohol.
• Prior relationship with the suspect, if any.
• Whether they were assaulted by an assailant who was in an authority position over them.
• Whether the assault was part of a broader continuum of violence and/or oppression (e.g., intimate
partner and family violence, gang violence, hate crimes, war crimes, commercial sexual exploitation,
sex and/or labor trafficking).
• Where the assault occurred.
• Whether they sustained physical injuries from the assault and the severity of the injuries.
• Whether they were engaged in illegal activities at the time of the assault (e.g., voluntary use of illegal
drugs or underage drinking) or have outstanding criminal charges.
• Whether they were involved in activities prior to the assault that traditionally generate victim blaming
or self-blaming (e.g., drinking alcohol prior to the assault or agreeing to go to the assailant’s home).
• Whether birth control was used during the assault (e.g., victims may already have been on a form of
birth control or the assailant may have used a condom).
• Capacity to cope with trauma and the level of support available from families and friends.
• The importance they place on the needs of their extended families and friends in the aftermath of the
assault.
• Whether they have dependents who require care during the exam, were traumatized by the assault,
or who may be affected by decisions patients make during the exam process.
• Community/cultural attitudes about sexual assault, its victims, and offenders.
• Frequency of sexual assault and other violence in the community and historical responsiveness of
the local justice system, health care systems, and community service agencies.
Clearly, the level of trauma experienced by patients can also influence their initial reactions to an assault and
to post-assault needs. While some may suffer physical injuries, contract an STI, or become pregnant as a
result of an assault, many others do not. The experience of psychological trauma will be unique to each
patient and may be more difficult to recognize than physical trauma. People have their own method of coping
with sudden stress. When severely traumatized, they can appear to be calm, indifferent, submissive, jocular,
angry, emotionally distraught, or even uncooperative or hostile towards those who are trying to help.38
38 Paragraph adapted from Iowa’s Sexual Assault: A Protocol for Forensic and Medical Examination, 1998, pp. 1–4.
30Examiners should ensure they do not make credibility determinations based on myths or misconceptions
about victim behavior.
In addition, patients’ fears and concerns can affect their initial reactions to the assault, their post-assault
needs, and decisions before, during, and after the exam process. For example, female and transgender
patients may be worried about getting pregnant. If they are already pregnant or have just given birth, they
may be concerned about how the assault will affect their children. Patients may be concerned about being
infected with HIV or another STI. They may not want anyone to know about the assault, or may be afraid that
family members and friends will reject or blame them. They may fear bringing shame to their families or be
concerned that family members will seek revenge against the assailant. They may fear perceived
consequences of reporting to law enforcement. They may be concerned how their cultural background could
affect the way they are treated by responders. They may wonder if the assailant will harm or harass them or
their loved ones if they tell anyone about the assault. They may worry about losing their home, children,
ability to remain in the United States, job, and other sources of income as a result of disclosure, particularly if
an intimate partner assaulted them.39 They may be concerned about costs related to the exam and
subsequent care of injuries.40
It is important to avoid making assumptions about patients, offenders, and the assault itself. Forms used
during the exam process and discussions with patients should be framed in a way that does not assume they
are of a specific background or gender identity and gender expression. Always ask questions and actively
look and listen to understand patients’ circumstances and tailor the exam process to address their needs and
concerns. Whatever the response, it should be respectful to patients and adhere to jurisdictional policies.
Recognize that patients control the extent of personal information they share. While it is useful for
responders to get a full picture of patients’ circumstances, it is up to patients to decide whether and to what
extent to share personal information. During the exam process, responders may ask patients to divulge
some data, such as age or whether they think the assault was alcohol- or drug-facilitated. Some information,
such as language needs, may be obvious. There is no reason for responders to question patients about
certain data, such as sexual orientation and gender identity, immigration status, or religious or spiritual
beliefs, beyond certain information that medical providers may need for appropriate care.
Develop culturally responsive care and be aware of issues commonly faced by patients from specific
populations. Develop culturally competent and sensitive care by building awareness about and sensitivity to
the ways that culture can impact a person’s experience in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault and
across their lifespan. Be aware and responsive to the ways in which cultural identities (e.g., race, ethnicity,
gender, religion, ability/disability, language (limited English proficiency), immigration status, socioeconomic
status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age) may influence a person’s experience during
the exam process as well. Education for responders on issues facing a specific population may serve to
enhance care, services, and interventions provided during the exam process. Responders should identify
different populations that exist in their jurisdiction and determine what information they should have readily
available to help them serve patients from these populations, including what languages are spoken by the
populations and how to access interpreters for each language needed. Building understanding of the
perspectives of a specific population may help increase the likelihood that the actions and demeanor of
responders will mitigate victim trauma. However, do not assume that patients will hold certain beliefs or have
certain needs and concerns merely because they belong to a specific population. And, as pointed out earlier,
recognize that patients’ experiences are affected by a plethora of other personal and external factors.
Develop policies and plans. Involved agencies and SART/SARRTs should develop policies and plans to
meet the needs of specific patient populations (e.g., to obtain necessary interpreter services and translated
documents for limited English proficient patients, qualified interpreters for Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients
and individuals with sensory or communication disabilities, and identify legal referrals for immigrant victims of
sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.) When creating these plans, consider what
barriers exist for patients from different populations to receiving a high-quality exam and what can be done to
39 Minors may fear being removed from their homes if suspects live with them. Persons living in residential settings, such as group
homes or nursing facilities, may fear being removed from their homes if they report an assault that occurred in that setting.
40 Paragraph partially adapted from the Ohio Protocol for Sexual Assault Forensic and Medical Examination, 2002, p. 2.
31remove these barriers. Also, consider what equipment and supplies might be needed to assist persons from
specific populations (e.g., a hydraulic lift exam table may be useful with victims who have a physical disability
or non-gendered body maps for transgender patients). Relevant responders need to have access to and
know how to use such equipment or supplies.
Partner with those who serve specific populations. Involved responders should seek expertise from and
collaborate with organizations and leaders that serve specific populations. Not only may they be willing to
provide information and training on working with victims from the population they serve, but they also may be
a resource before, during, and after the exam process. If responders may be involved in the immediate
response to victims, they should be trained on the dynamics of sexual victimization and procedures for
getting help for victims and work with the multidisciplinary response team to clarify their roles and procedures
for response.
Explore the needs of specific populations. To gain a basic understanding of potential issues and concerns
facing different groups of sexual assault victims, this section explores several specific populations.41 Clearly,
this exploration is not inclusive of all populations of victims, but a more comprehensive discussion on this
topic is beyond the scope of this document.
―Victims from various cultural groups
• Understand that culture can influence beliefs about sexual assault, its victims, and offenders. It can
affect health care beliefs and practices related to the assault and medical treatment outcomes. It can
also influence beliefs and practices related to emotional healing from an assault. In addition, it can
impact beliefs and practices regarding justice in the aftermath of a sexual assault, the response of
the criminal justice system, and the willingness of victims to be involved in the system.42
• Understand that some victims may be apprehensive about interacting with responders from ethnic
and racial backgrounds different from their own. They may fear or distrust responders or assume
they will be met with insensitive comments or unfair treatment. They may benefit from responders of
the same background or at least who understand their culture. Conversely, in smaller ethnic and
racial communities, victims may be more likely to know the responder and doubt the responder’s
ability to maintain confidentiality.
• Be aware that cultural beliefs may preclude a member of the opposite sex from being present when
victims disrobe. Also, it may be uncomfortable for victims from some cultures to speak about the
assault with members of the opposite sex.
• Understand that victims may not report or discuss the assault because the stigma associated with it
is so overwhelmingly negative. In some cultures, for example, the loss of virginity prior to marriage is
devastating and may render victims unacceptable for an honorable marriage. Even discussing an
assault or sexual terms may be linked with intense embarrassment and shame in some cultures.
• Be aware that beliefs about women, men, sexuality, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
race, ethnicity, and religion may vary greatly among victims of different cultural backgrounds. Also,
understand that what helps one victim deal with a traumatic situation like sexual assault may not be
the same for another victim.
• Help victims obtain culturally specific assistance and/or provide referrals where they exist.43
―Victims with limited English proficiency44

43 For example, to raise their level of hope and comfort during the exam, some patients may benefit from talking about culturally specific
models of healing (where they exist) and their application to recovery from sexual assault. To facilitate such a discussion, they may wish
to speak with a religious or spiritual healer from their culture.

32• Be patient and understanding toward victims’ language skills and barriers, which may worsen with
the crisis of sexual assault.45
• Develop policies and train responders to be able to identify a victim’s limited English proficiency and
primary language spoken and written.
• Make every attempt to provide same language service through the use of demonstrably bilingual
examiners or by providing monolingual examiners with support from professional interpretation
services and translated materials for victims who are not proficient in English,46 are LEP or who may
prefer to communicate in a non-English language. Use qualified interpreters when possible and not
victims’ families or friends.47 Take the victim’s country of origin, acculturation level, and dialect into
account when responding or arranging interpretation.48 Remember to speak directly to victims when
interpreters are used. Consider the victim’s need for modesty and privacy when determining where
interpreters should be located in the exam room.
• Train interpreters about issues related to sexual assault and the exam process49 whenever they are
needed to facilitate communication in these cases. Ensure that the examiners are trained in the
proper utilization and ethical requirements of using an interpreter.
• Make sure that interpreters understand that they may need to testify.50
• Understand that immigrant victims may fear that assisting law enforcement may identify them to
immigration authorities for deportation.
• All sexual assault victims should be provided information regarding U-Visa relief, in the event that
this information would be helpful. Even if this information is not helpful to them directly, the
information is often passed on to others by word of mouth and can benefit others in the future.
• Work with law enforcement partners to develop and publicize protocols precluding detention or other
immigration enforcement against victims who come forward to report a sexual assault.
• Work with law enforcement to develop and publicize U-Visa certification protocols.
• While it is not appropriate to ask a victim’s immigration status, anticipate that an immigrant victim will
not self-identify as undocumented for fear of deportation. Such information about their rights should
be offered in a non-judgmental manner to all victims and in coordination with a referral to an
immigration service provider expert in working with immigrant victim populations.
―Victims with disabilities
• Understand that victims with disabilities may have physical, sensory, cognitive, developmental, or
mental health disabilities, or a combination of disabilities. Make every effort to recognize issues that
arise for victims with disabilities (both in general and in relation to their specific disability) and provide
reasonable accommodations when working with them.
• Be aware that the risk of criminal victimization (including sexual assault) for people with disabilities is
much higher than for people without disabilities. People with disabilities are often victimized

Justice Project, October 2004, http://new.vawnet.org/summary.php?doc_id=1621&find_type=web_desc_GC.
46 Health care providers generally are covered by language access requirements under Title VI which requires them to take reasonable
steps to provide language-appropriate health care, including the use of qualified bilingual staff, interpreters, and translators.
47 Use of such informal and biased interpreters may result in unreliable communication, violate the patient’s privacy, undermine the
patient’s claim of privilege, and jeopardize the use of the victim’s statements in court. In cases of intimate partner sexual assault, it is
particularly important not to use family members who are not likely to adopt a neutral stance or maintain the confidentiality necessary.
48 For example, a Cuban interpreter may encounter language and trust obstacles when trying to communicate with a victim from rural
Mexico. (L. Zarate, Suggestions for Upgrading the Cultural Competency Skills of SARTs, Arte Sana Web site, http://www.arte-sana.com,
2003.)
49 Professional interpreters are expected to be familiar with confidentiality requirements and cultural issues.
50 Interpreters would not be expected to act as witnesses as to what was said in the examination room if they are present solely to
facilitate direct communication between the patient and examiner.
33repeatedly by the same offender.51 Caretakers, family members, or friends may be responsible for
the sexual assault. In such cases, offenders may bring victims to the exam site, and jurisdictional
and facility policies should be in place to provide guidance on how staff should screen for and handle
situations that are threatening to patients or facility personnel.
• Respect victims’ wishes to have or not to have caretakers, family members, or friends present during
the exam. Although these individuals may be accustomed to speaking on behalf of persons with
disabilities, it is critical that they not influence the statements of victims during the exam process. If
aid is required (e.g., from a language interpreter or mental health professional), those providing
assistance should not be associated with victims.
• Follow exam facility and jurisdictional policy for assessing vulnerable adults’ ability to consent to the
exam and evidence collection and involving protective services. Again, note that guardians could be
offenders. (For a more detailed discussion on seeking informed consent of patients, including
consent by victims from specific populations, see A.3. Informed Consent.)
• Speak directly to victims with disabilities, even when interpreters, intermediaries, or guardians are
present.
• Assess a victim’s level of ability and need for assistance during the exam process. Explain exam
procedures to victims and ask what help they require, if any (e.g., people with physical disabilities
may need assistance to get on and off the exam table or to assume positions necessary for the
exam, or may need an alternative to the standard table). But, do not assume they will need special
aid. Ask for permission before proceeding to help them (or touch them, handle a mobility or
communication device, or touch a service animal).52
• Note that not all individuals who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing understand sign language or can read
lips. Not all blind persons can read Braille. Communication equipment that may be beneficial to
victims with sensory disabilities include TTY machines, word boards, speech synthesizers,
anatomically correct dolls, materials in alternative formats, and access to interpreter services.
Responders should familiarize themselves with the basics of communicating with an individual using
such devices.53 Let the individual specify the preferred method of communication. Be aware that
victims with sensory disabilities may prefer communicating through an intermediary who is familiar
with their patterns of speech.
• Recognize that individuals may have some degree of cognitive disability: mental retardation,
traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, or stroke. Speak
to victims in a clear and calm voice and ask very specific and concrete questions. Be exact when
explaining what will happen during the exam process and why. Be aware that victims with cognitive
disabilities may be easily distracted and have difficulty focusing. To reduce distractions, conduct the
exam in an area that is void of bright lights and loud noises. It may also be helpful if examiners and
others present in the exam room refrain from wearing uniforms with ornamental designs and jewelry.
• Keep in mind that victims with disabilities may be reluctant to report the crime or consent to the exam
for a variety of reasons, including fear of not being believed, fear of getting in trouble, and fear of
losing their independence. For example, they may have to enter a long-term care facility if their
caretakers assaulted them or may need extended hospitalization to treat and allow injuries to heal.
The perpetrator may also be their caregiver and the only person they rely on for daily living
assistance.
• Recognize that it may be the first time victims with disabilities have an internal exam. The procedure
should be explained in detail in language they can understand.54 They may have limited knowledge
of reproductive health issues and not be able to describe what happened to them. They may not
know how they feel about the incident or even identify that a crime was committed against them.
• Some victims with disabilities may want to talk about their perceptions of the role their disability might
have played in making them vulnerable to an assault. Listen to their concerns and what the

Assault.
34experience was like for them.55 Assure them that it was not their fault they were sexually assaulted. If
needed, encourage discussion in a counseling/advocacy setting on this issue as well as on what
might help them feel safer in the future.
• Recognize that the exam may take longer to perform with victims with disabilities. Avoid rushing
through the exam—such action not only may distress victims, it can lead to missed evidence and
information.
―Male victims56
• Help male victims understand that male sexual assault is not uncommon and that the assault was
not their fault. Many male victims focus on the sexual aspect of the assault and overlook other
elements such as coercion, power differences, and emotional abuse. Broadening their understanding
of sexual assault may help reduce their self-blame.
• Because some male victims may fear public disclosure of the assault and the stigma associated with
male sexual victimization, emphasis may need to be placed on the scope of confidentiality of patient
information during the exam process.
• Offer male victims assistance in considering how friends and family members will react to the fact
that they were sexually assaulted (e.g., by a male offender or a female offender).
• Male victims may be less likely than females to seek and receive support from family members and
friends, as well as from advocacy and counseling services. Their ability to seek support may vary
according to the level of stigmatization they feel, the circumstances of the assault, the sensitivity of
care they initially receive, and the appropriateness of referrals provided.
• Encourage advocacy programs and the mental health community to build their capacity to serve
male sexual assault victims and increase their accessibility to this population. Requests by male
victims to have an advocate of a particular gender should be respected and honored if possible.57
―Adolescent victims58
• Adolescents may be brought to the exam site by their parents or guardians. The presence of parents
or guardians creates an additional challenge for those involved in the exam process because they
are often traumatized by their child’s victimization.
• Understand that parents or guardians may blame victims for the assault if the victim disobeyed them
or engaged in behaviors perceived as increasing risk for victimization.
• Health care providers must assess the physical development of adolescent victims and take their
age into consideration when determining appropriate methods of examination and evidence
collection.59 Involved professionals should be well versed in jurisdictional policies related to response
to minor victims.
• Be aware of jurisdictional laws governing minors’ ability to consent to forensic exams and medical
treatment. Follow exam facility and jurisdictional policy in obtaining appropriate consent. (For a more
detailed discussion on seeking informed consent of patients, including consent by victims from
specific populations, see A.3. Informed Consent.)
• Recognize that the sexual assault medical forensic exam may be the first time an adolescent female
victim has an internal exam. There may be a need to go into detail when explaining what to expect.60

35• Adolescence is often a time of experimentation. Reassure these victims that regardless of their
behavior (e.g., using alcohol and drugs, engaging in illegal activities, or hitchhiking), no one has the
right to sexually assault them, and they are not to blame for the assault.
• Ideally, attending health care providers should gather information from adolescents without parents
or guardians in the room, subject to victims’ consent. The concern is that parents or guardians may
influence or be perceived as influencing victims’ statements.
• Inform victims, particularly those who do not involve parents or guardians in the exam process, of
facility billing practices (e.g., that their parents may get a bill from the medical facility for medical
treatment provided or an explanation of benefits from their insurance provider).61
• Be aware of mandatory reporting laws regarding minor victims and explain to the victim any
mandatory reporting obligations.
―Older victims
• Keep in mind that the emotional impact of the assault may not be felt by older victims until after the
exam when they are alone in the days, weeks, and months following an attack. Older victims may
feel common trauma reactions such as being physically vulnerable, reduced resiliency, and mortality.
Fear, anger, and depression can be especially severe in older victims who are isolated, have little
support, and live on a fixed or limited income. 62
• Be aware that caretakers may sexually assault older adults. Older adults may be dependent on
these sexual offenders for emotional or financial support or housing. Offenders may bring victims to
the exam site. Some offenders may be charming to staff while others may be threatening or
menacing. Jurisdictional and facility policies should be in place to provide guidance on how staff
should screen for and handle situations that are threatening to patients or facility personnel.
• Note that older victims may be more physically fragile than younger victims and thus may be at risk
for tissue or skeletal damage and exacerbation of existing illnesses and vulnerabilities.63
• Hearing impairment and other physical conditions attendant to advancing age, coupled with the initial
trauma reaction to the assault, may render some older victims unable to make their needs known,
which could result in prolonged or inappropriate treatment.64
• Do not mistake disabilities (such as hearing loss or aphasia) or acute stress reaction following
assault for senility. Use of appropriate communication remedies, for example, a personal listening
device, may enable an older adult with a severe hearing loss to communicate effectively. Also, be
aware that older adults typically process information more slowly than younger adults and take
longer to put their thoughts into words. This is a normal age-related change and should not be
viewed as evidence of lack of mental capacity. Health care professionals treating elders need to
speak slowly and clearly and give elders ample time to process information provided and formulate
responses. If questions about the victim’s capacity arise, contact trained experts to conduct an
assessment.
• If a forensic medical exam has been requested by a law enforcement officer, guardian, or other
authority, it is still important to obtain the victim’s consent and cooperation to forensic evidence-
gathering procedures. Those making the request may argue that evidence collection may be
especially important because the victim may be unable to provide a statement or testify. However,
when victims lack capacity and are unable to provide consent and cooperation, they should not be

63 Older women are at an increased risk for vaginal tears and injury when they have been vaginally assaulted. Decreased hormonal
levels following menopause result in a reduction in vaginal lubrication and cause the vaginal wall to become thinner and more friable.
Because of these physiological changes, a Pedersen speculum, which is longer and thinner than the Graves speculum, should be used
during the pelvic exam for evidence collection. Special care should also be taken to assess for intravaginal injury. In some older women,
examiners will need to simply insert the swabs and avoid the trauma of inserting a speculum. If there are external tears in the introitus,
internal injuries must also be considered. The recovery process for older victims also tends to be longer than for younger victims.

36forcibly examined or subjected to forensic procedures that are not necessary for their own health and
safety.
• Health care personnel should follow facility policy for assessing a vulnerable adult’s ability to consent
to the exam and evidence collection, as well as involving adult protective services.
• Some older victims may want to talk about their perceptions of the role their age and physical
condition might have played in making them vulnerable to an assault. Others may be traumatized by
being harmed sexually by a family member or trusted caregiver. Listen to their concerns and what
the experience was like for them.65 Assure them that it was not their fault they were sexually
assaulted. If needed, encourage further discussion on this issue in a counseling/advocacy setting.
• Some older victims may be reluctant to report the crime or seek treatment because they fear losing
their independence. Some older sexual assault victims may need a significant amount of time to
recover from injuries that are the result of the abuse or attack. When a change in a living
environment, such as placement in a residential facility, is truly needed, older victims who have not
been adjudicated as lacking mental capacity and requiring guardians have the legal right to make
their own decisions regarding choice of residence. Health care providers must avoid colluding with
relatives who want to force older adults into unwanted lifestyle changes subsequent to assault.
• Older adults who have been sexually assaulted in care facilities often experience intense feelings of
vulnerability in those facilities following sexual assault and desperately want to be relocated. Elders
who rely upon others for care are likely to need the assistance of relatives and involved professionals
in being safely relocated.
• Encourage use of follow-up medical, legal, and nonlegal assistance. Older victims may be reluctant
to seek these services or proceed with prosecution. If barriers to accessing services or ongoing
health care exist, such as lack of transportation, work with local service providers to identify potential
remedies.
―Victims in the military66
• The military offers victims the option of restricted reporting or unrestricted reporting.67 Restricted
reporting allows a sexual assault victim to confidentially disclose the details of his or her assault to
specified individuals and receive medical treatment and counseling without triggering the official
investigative process or command notification. Restricted Reporting can be voided if the medical
facility contacts law enforcement or other professionals other than advocates, chaplains, and military
sexual assault response coordinators.
• Exam sites that provide exams for military installations are encouraged to draft Memoranda of
Understanding to address such issues as confidentiality and storage of evidence.
―American Indian and Alaska Native victims
• Keep in mind that American Indian and Alaska Native victims may have unique cultural or language
needs, whether they are assaulted in Indian Country or an Alaska Native village or in an urban area.
• Recognize that Indian tribes may have their own laws and regulations, as well as their own police,
prosecutors, advocates, courts, and service providers to address sexual assault. Responders should
be familiar with procedures for coordinating services and interventions for victims from these

66 The Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) has developed a resource to assist address sexual assault in the military. Strengthening
Military-Civilian Community Partnerships to Respond to Sexual Assault is a training curriculum and tool kit for community-based civilian
rape crisis centers and state sexual assault coalitions to use in their work with the military installations in their regions. Funding for this
project was provided by OVC and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and was developed by the Pennsylvania Coalition
Against Rape (PCAR) and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC) in coordination with the Department of Defense’s
Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. Through OVC’s Training and Technical Assistance Center (OVC TTAC) the
curriculum and tool kit will be available for communities to use in their regions to train on enhancing community response, and effectively
responding to the needs of sexual assault victims in the military.
67 For more information on reporting in the military, please see http://www.sapr.mil/.
37communities and should work with community groups to develop plans for providing exams to
members of Indian tribes. These plans should address evidence preservation and provide
examination payment and reimbursement information. Responders within tribal communities should
share resources and information to enable them to develop their own protocols and programs that
address the community’s unique needs.
• Promote partnerships among tribal and relevant federal and state agencies so they better coordinate
responses and resources, learn from past mistakes, and strive towards a shared vision of aiding and
empowering victims.
• Be aware that tribal jurisdictions may have their own SAFE protocol in place that addresses the
tribe’s unique needs and incorporates its cultural traditions, practices, and language.
• As in many cultures, American Indian/Alaska Native women are of central and primary importance to
the family and the community. Be mindful that sexual violence against a Native woman may be seen
as an assault on both the individual and her community.
• Be sensitive to victims’ cultural beliefs and practices. The best practice is to always ask victims
rather than assume what they need to be safe, address their health concerns, be supported in inner
healing, and feel a sense of justice.
• Be aware of the tribe’s history. Responders should have an understanding of the impact of history on
American Indian/Alaska Native people as it may influence victims’ reactions and needs. Adequate
self-education combined with training by tribal members can prepare non-Native responders to be
sensitive to the historical context in which victimization occurs and to avoid assumptions about
victims’ cultural practices.
• Recognize that there are multiple ways for victims to seek justice—through criminal justice
interventions, tribal justice systems, and use of more traditional practices of the tribe related to
holding perpetrators accountable, and/or other victim-identified strategies.
• Include American Indian/Alaska Native populations in Limited English Proficiency protocols for
victims of sexual assault.
―Lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) victims
• Intake forms and other documents that ask about gender or sex should allow patients to write in a
response, or include transgender and intersex options. Make sure questions appropriately
distinguish between sexual orientation (the gender(s) someone is attracted to), gender identity (the
internal sense of being woman, man, or gender non-conforming), and their sex.
• Always refer to victims by their preferred name and pronoun, even when speaking to others. If
unsure of what to call the person or what pronoun to use, ask.
• Treat the knowledge that the person is LGBT as protected medical information subject to all
confidentiality and privacy rules. Be aware that companions of LGBT victims may not know their
gender identity or sexual orientation.
Additional suggestions specific to victims who are transgender or gender non-conforming:
• It is critical to not show surprise, shock, dismay, or concern when you are either told or inadvertently
discover that a person is transgender. Be especially careful about your body language – gasping,
sighing, a sharp intake of breath, or widening eyes can all be very upsetting to someone who may
worry that you are making a judgment or assessment of their body.
• Understand that transgender people have typically been subject to others’ curiosity, prejudice, and
violence. Keep in mind that transgender victims may be reluctant to report the crime or consent to
the exam for fear of being exposed to inappropriate questions or abuse. If the victim does consent to
an exam, be especially careful to explain what you want to do and why before each step, and
respect their right to decline any part of the exam.
• Be aware that transgender individuals may have increased shame or dissociation from their body.
Some use nonstandard labels for body parts, and others are unable to discuss sex-related body
38parts at all. Reflect the victim’s language when possible and use alternative means of communication
(such as anatomically correct dolls or paper and pen for the victim to write or draw) if necessary
• Vaginas that have been exposed to testosterone or created surgically are more fragile than vaginas
of most non-transgender women and may sustain more damage in an assault. There may be
additional layers of psychological trauma for patients with a male identity or a constructed vagina
when they have been vaginally assaulted.
• Transgender male individuals who still have ovaries and a uterus can become pregnant even when
they were using testosterone and/or had not been menstruating.
• Transgender people may engage in self-harm as a coping mechanism. However, cutting and genital
mutilations are also frequently part of anti-transgender hate crimes. Be nonjudgmental and careful
when documenting such injuries.
• Some transgender victims may want to talk about their perceptions of the role their gender identity
might have played in making them vulnerable to an assault. Because of their value in possible
prosecutions under hate crime laws, document any anti-transgender statements the victim says were
made during the assault. Otherwise, listen to the victim’s concerns and what the experience was like
for them. Assure them that it was not their fault they were sexually assaulted. If needed, encourage
discussion in a counseling/advocacy setting on this issue as well as on what might help them feel
safer in the future.
• Ensure that all referrals given to a transgender victim have been trained on or have significant
experience with the special needs of transgender survivors of sexual assault.
• Include opportunities for LGBT individuals to influence the development of sensitive responses for
victims of sexual assault.
Recognize the importance of victim services within the exam process. In many jurisdictions, sexual
assault victim advocacy programs and other victim service programs offer a range of services before, during,
and after the exam process (see below for a description of typical services). Ideally, advocates should begin
interacting with victims in a language the victims understand prior to the exam, as soon after disclosure of
the assault as possible. Victims who come to exam sites in the immediate aftermath of an assault are
typically coping with trauma, anticipating the exam, and considering the implications of reporting. Most
responders that victims come in contact with are focused on objective tasks. Law enforcement officials
gather information and collect crime scene evidence to facilitate the investigation. Health care personnel
assess medical needs, offer treatment, and collect evidence from victims. Victims must make many related
decisions that may seem overwhelming. Advocates68 can offer a tangible and personal connection to a long-
term source of support and advocacy. Community-based advocates, in particular, have the sole purpose of
supporting victims’ needs and wishes. Typically, these advocates are able to talk with victims with some
degree of confidentiality, depending on jurisdictional statutes, while statements victims make to examiners
become part of the medical forensic report.69 When community-based advocates support victims, examiners
can more easily maintain an objective stance.70 In addition, civil attorneys may be able to help victims assess
legal needs and options, including privacy, safety, immigration, housing, education, and employment issues.
Be aware of the extent of services. Services offered by advocates during the exam process may include: 71
• Accompanying the victims through each component (advocates may accompany victims from the
initial contact and the actual exam through to discharge and follow-up appointments).
• Serving as an information resource for victims (e.g., to answer questions; explain the importance of
prompt law enforcement involvement if the decision is made to report; explain the value of medical
and evidence collection procedures; explain legal aspects of the exam; help them understand their
68 To prepare them to competently provide sexual assault victim services, community-based advocates are typically trained according to
the policies of the sexual assault advocacy agency where they are employed/volunteer and receive supervision related to their
interactions with victims. In addition, many jurisdictions have specific requirements that community-based advocates must meet in order
to fit within jurisdictional confidentiality or privilege laws. Advocates should meet these requirements. System-based advocates may be
required to have specific credentials based on system and jurisdictional policies and laws.

for any future inquiries such as payment method for the exams; and provide referrals).
• Assisting in coordination of victim transportation to and from the exam site.
• Providing victims with crisis intervention72 and support to help cope with the trauma of the assault73
and begin the healing process.
• Actively listening to victims to assist in sorting through and identifying their feelings.
• Letting victims know their reactions to the assault are normal and dispelling misconceptions
regarding sexual assault.
• Advocating for victims’ self-articulated needs to be identified and their choices to be respected, as
well as advocating for appropriate and coordinated response by all involved professionals;
• Supporting victims in voicing their concerns to relevant responders.
• Responding in a culturally and linguistically sensitive and appropriate manner to victims from
different backgrounds and circumstances and advocating for the elimination of barriers to
communication.
• Providing replacement clothing when clothing is retained for evidence, as well as toiletries.
• Aiding victims in identifying individuals who could support them as they heal (e.g., family members,
friends, counselors, employers, religious or spiritual counselors/advisors, and/or teachers).
• Helping victims’ families and friends cope with their reactions to the assault, providing information,
and increasing their understanding of the type of support victims may need from them.
• Assisting victims in planning for their safety and well-being.
Postexam, advocates can continue to advocate for victims’ rights and wishes; offer victims ongoing support,
counseling,74 information, and referrals for community services; assist with applications for victim
compensation programs;75 and encourage victims to obtain follow-up testing and treatment and take
medications as directed. They can also accompany victims to follow-up appointments, including those for
related medical care and criminal and civil justice-related interviews and proceedings. They can work closely
with the responders involved to ensure that postexam services and interventions are coordinated in a
complementary manner and are appropriately based on victims’ needs and wishes.
Contact the victim service/advocacy program immediately. Utilize a system in which exam facility personnel,
upon initial contact with a sexual assault patient, call the victim service/advocacy program and ask for an
advocate to be sent to the exam site (unless an advocate has already been called).76 Prior to introducing the
advocate to a patient, exam facility personnel should explain briefly, in a language the patient understands,
the victim services offered and ask whether the victim wishes to speak with the onsite advocate. Note that
some jurisdictions require that patients be asked whether they want to talk with an advocate before the
advocate is contacted.77 If possible, victims should be allowed to meet with advocates in a private place prior
to the exam. Ideally, a patient should be assisted by the same advocate during the entire exam process.78
72 Crisis intervention counseling is short term in nature, aimed at returning individuals to their precrisis state through the development of
adaptive coping responses. Broadly, it entails establishing a relationship with the individual in crisis, gathering information about what is
occurring, clarifying the problem, helping the individual identify options and resources so that they are able to make an informed
decision as to what, if any, actions will be taken. (Adapted from the 1991 Women Helping Women Volunteer Training Manual,
Cincinnati, Ohio.) Note: Crisis intervention is not intended to address longer term counseling and advocacy needs.
73 See A. Burgess and L. Holmstrom, Rape Trauma Syndrome, American Journal of Psychiatry, 131: 981-986, September 1974, for a
summary of the psychological, somatic, and behavioral impact of sexual assault on victims.
74 Many advocacy agencies offer ongoing support and advocacy to victims. Some also provide professional mental health counseling,
but many refer victims to community or private agencies.
75 For more information on crime victim’s compensation, please see
http://www.ovc.gov/publications/factshts/compandassist/welcome.html.
76 Use community-based sexual assault victim advocates where possible. If not available, victim service providers based in the exam
facility, criminal justice system, social services, or other agencies may be able to provide some advocacy services if educated to provide
those services. Patients should be aware that government-based service providers typically cannot offer confidential communication.
77 In very small communities, patients may know some or all advocates (e.g., a small, close-knit community that speaks an uncommon
dialect). Some patients may feel comfortable being supported by an advocate known to them while others may not. Patients concerned
about anonymity should be provided with as many options as possible. For example, ask if they would like to speak with an on-call
advocate on the phone prior to making their decision about whether they want an advocate present during the exam. Another option
may be for the local advocacy program to partner with an advocacy program in a neighboring jurisdiction, so they can provide one
another with backup to handle situations such as this one.
78 Continuity of advocates can be challenging when response by other professionals is delayed, the exam process is lengthy, or travel to
the exam site is considerable. Volunteers may or may not be able to continue providing services after the end of their on-call shift.
40Understandably, immigrant victims may be reluctant to discuss or report the victimization. It is inappropriate
to ask patients about aspects of their health, body, legal status, or identity that are not related to the assault.
It is, however, appropriate to ensure that all victims are provided with information regarding U-Visas, in the
event that this relief would be appropriate.79
Accommodate patients’ requests to have a relative, friend, or other personal support person (e.g.,
religious and spiritual counselor/advisor/healer) present during the exam, unless considered harmful
by responders.80 An exception would be if responders consider the request to be potentially harmful to the
patient or the exam process.81 Patients’ requests to not have certain individuals present in the room should
also be respected (e.g., adolescents may not want their parents present). Examiners should get explicit
consent from patients to go forward with the exam with another person present. When others are present,
appropriately drape patients and position additional persons. (It is also important to inform patients of
confidentiality considerations regarding the presence of support persons during the medical forensic history.
For a discussion of this topic, see C.4. The Medical Forensic History.)
Strive to limit the number of persons (beyond the patient, examiner, advocate, personal support person, and
any necessary interpreters) in the exam room during the exam. The primary reason is to protect patients’
privacy, but also because exam rooms often cannot accommodate more than a few individuals. Law
enforcement representatives should not be present during the exam. When additional health care personnel
are needed for consultation (e.g., a surgeon), patients’ permission should be sought prior to their admittance.
In cases in which examiners are supervising an examiner-in-training/licensed health care student, patients’
consent should be obtained prior to the student’s admittance to examine patients or observe the exam. It is
inappropriate to ask patients to allow a group of nonlicensed medical students to view the exam. It is also
inappropriate to ask patients about aspects of their health, body, legal status, or identity that are not related
to the assault.
Accommodate patients’ requests for responders of a specific gender throughout the exam as much
as possible. For a variety of reasons, some patients may prefer to work with a male or female law
enforcement official, advocate, and/or examiner.
Prior to starting the exam and conducting each procedure, explain to patients in a language the
patients understand what is entailed and its purpose. In addition, it is important to explain the exam
process and the purpose of the exam more generally (e.g., how the evidence may be used by the criminal
justice system). A clear explanation is particularly important for individuals who may not previously have had
a pelvic exam or medical care, or who have difficulty understanding what has happened and why they are
being asked to undergo a medical forensic exam. Remember that some exam procedures may be
uncomfortable and painful to patients, considering the nature of the trauma they have experienced. By taking
the time to explain procedures and their options, patients may be able to better relax, feel more in control of
what’s occurring, and make decisions that meet their needs. After providing the needed information, seek
patients’ permission to proceed with exam procedures. (For a more detailed discussion on seeking informed
consent of patients, see A.3. Informed Consent.)
Address and respect patients’ priorities. Although medical care and evidence collection may be
encouraged during the exam process, responders should provide patients with information about all of their
options and assess and respect their priorities.
Integrate medical and evidentiary procedures where possible. Medical care and evidence collection
procedures should be integrated to maximize efficiency and minimize trauma to patients. For example, draw
blood needed for medical and evidentiary purposes at the same time. Also, coordinate information-gathering
by health care and legal personnel to minimize the need for patients to repeat their statements. (For more
information on coordination in information gathering, see C.4. The Medical Forensic History.) Consider the

women-program/u-visa.html. Additionally, immigrant women are entitled to emergency medical and post-assault healthcare. For a state-
by-state breakdown of the benefits afforded see: http://www.legalmomentum.org/assets/pdfs/4_nilc_table_10.pdf.

suspected of committing the assault or of being otherwise abusive to the patient.

coordination. See Appendix C for more information on the relevant case law and how it relates to medical
forensic examinations.
Address patients’ safety during the exam. When patients arrive at the exam site, health care providers
should assess related safety concerns. For example, a caretaker, partner, or family member who is
suspected of committing the assault may have accompanied the patient to the facility. Some victims,
including transgender people, may also fear assault or belittlement by health care professionals’ and/or law
enforcement officials’ responses to their gender identity or expression and/or transgender body. Follow
facility policy on response to this and other types of threatening situations. Also, exam sites should have
plans in place to protect patients from exposure to potentially infectious materials during the examination.
(See B.1. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners.) Prior to discharge, assist victims in planning for their safety
and well-being. Planning should take into account needs that may arise in different types of cases. For
example, patients who know the assailants may not be concerned only about their ongoing safety but also
about the safety of their families and friends. Local law enforcement may be able to assist facilities in
addressing patients’ safety needs. (See C.10. Discharge and Follow-up.)
Provide information that is easy for patients to understand, in the patient’s language, and that can be
reviewed at their convenience.82 Information should be tailored to patients’ communication skill
level/modality and language. This includes providing interpreter services and the translation of documents
into languages other than English for limited English proficient (LEP) patients. Developing material in
alternative formats may be useful, such as information that is taped, in Braille, in large print, in various
languages, or uses pictures and simple language.83 A victim booklet or packet that includes information about
the following topics may be helpful:
• The crime itself (e.g., facts about sexual assault and related criminal statutes).
• Normal reactions to sexual assault (stressing that it is never the victim’s fault), and signs and
symptoms of traumatic response.
• Victims’ rights.
• Victim support and advocacy services.
• Civil, criminal, and immigration legal services.
• Mental health counseling options and referrals.
• Resources for the victim’s significant others.
• The examination—what happened and how evidence/findings will be used.
• Medical discharge and follow-up instructions.
• Planning for the victim’s safety and well-being.
• Examination payment and reimbursement information.
• Steps and options in the criminal justice process.
• Civil and immigration remedies that may be available to sexual assault victims.
• Procedures for victims to access their medical record or applicable law enforcement reports.
Address physical comfort needs of patients prior to discharge. For example, provide them with the
opportunity to wash in privacy (offering shower facilities if at all possible84), brush their teeth, change clothes
(clean and ideally new replacement clothing should be available); get food and/or a beverage, and make
needed phone calls. They may also require assistance in coordinating transportation from the exam site to
their home or another location.
82 Many local sexual assault advocacy programs and state coalitions of sexual assault programs offer publications that speak to victims’
concerns in the aftermath of an assault. However, any involved agency, SART, or coordinating council could develop such literature.
83 For example, one sexual assault advocacy program offers a booklet “for those who read best with few words” designed for people
with developmental disabilities who have been sexually assaulted. For more information on this publication, contact the Los Angeles
Commission on Assaults Against Women by phone (213–955–9090) or e-mail info@lacaaw.org.

423. Informed Consent
Recommendations at a glance for health care providers and other responders for requesting patients’
consent throughout the exam process:
• Seek the informed consent of patients as appropriate throughout the exam process.
• Make sure policies exist to guide the process of seeking informed consent from specific populations.
Seek the informed consent of patients as appropriate throughout the exam process. There are two
essential but separate consent processes—one for overall medical evaluation and treatment and a second
for evidence collection and release. Patients should understand the full nature of their consent to each
procedure, whether it is medical or evidentiary (e.g., what the procedure entails, possible side effects, limits
of confidentiality, and potential impact). The only way to put patients in the position of being able to make
informed decisions about whether to allow a procedure is by presenting them with all relevant information in
a language they understand. Patients can decline any part or all of the examination. However, the informed
consent process includes making patients aware of the impact of declining a procedure, as it may negatively
affect the quality of care and the usefulness of evidence collection. It may also have a negative impact on a
criminal investigation and/or prosecution both because evidence not collected may have been useful and
because defense attorneys in a civil or criminal case may use the fact that the victim declined a procedure to
claim that the victim is hiding something that would have been revealed by that procedure. They should
understand that declining a procedure might also be used by opposing counsel to discredit the victim at trial.
Before making any disclosures, patients should be advised whether their communications are confidential
and whether the confidentiality of the statements is covered by a privilege. Understanding what will happen
to the information provided and the extent to which it may be protected is an important component of
informed consent.
Health care providers and other responders must refrain from any judgment or coercive practice in seeking
patients’ consent. It is contrary to ethical and professional practices to influence their decisions.
Seek both verbal and written consent as required by policy. In addition to verbally providing information and
seeking consent throughout the exam process, written consent of patients may be needed in order to carry
out specific procedures. Verbal and written consent from patients who are limited English proficient may
require the use of foreign language interpreters for verbal consent and for written consent to have the
interpreters provide a sight translation of written documents and the translation of consent forms and other
documents into non-english languages.85 It is important that jurisdictions, agencies, and exam facilities make
it very clear to responders when written consent is necessary, how it should be sought, and provide
appropriate checklists and forms to facilitate obtaining written consent in a consistent manner.
Methods to inform patients verbally and seek their consent vary significantly across jurisdictions and
individuals requesting consent. For example, some examiners ask patients to voice their consent to each
exam procedure while others explain from the start that they need patients to tell them if they want to stop at
any time. While respecting the individual communication styles of responders, the process of obtaining
consent can be enhanced when they are educated on how to seek verbal consent logistically in a way that is
consistent across patients and helps facilitate the exam process as specified by the jurisdiction and facility.
Verbal and written information given to patients to facilitate the consent process should be complete, clear,
and concise. This information, along with consent forms, should be tailored to the communication skill
level/modality and language of patients. Responders should be aware of verbal and nonverbal cues from
patients and adjust their methods of seeking consent to meet patients’ needs. Encourage patients to ask
questions and to inform relevant responders if they need a break or information repeated or do not want a
particular part of the exam process done. Make sure all signatures and dates needed are obtained on written
85 See The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (Joint Commission) New & Revised Standards & EPs for
Patient-Centered Communication, Accreditation Program: Hospital, RI, 01.01.03, effective January 1, 2011.
43consent forms and document consent or reasons for declining to consent as appropriate (either on the
medical record or forensic report forms).
Seek consent for medical evaluation and treatment in a language that the patient understands. Follow facility
policy for seeking patients’ consent for medical evaluation and treatment. Any written medical consent forms
developed for the purpose of the exam may need to be reviewed and approved by facility administration.
Documentation on consent for medical evaluation and treatment becomes part of the medical record.
Informed consent of patients for medical evaluation and treatment typically is needed for the following:
• General medical care.
• Pregnancy testing and care.
• Testing and prophylaxis for STIs.
• HIV prophylaxis.
• Photographs, including colposcopic images.
• Permission to contact the patient for medical purposes.
• Release of medical information.
Seek consent for evidence collection and release in a language that the patient understands. Follow
jurisdictional procedure for obtaining informed consent for the exam and evidence collection. Informed
consent of patients typically is needed for:
• Notification to law enforcement or other authority (depends upon reporting requirements).
• Evidence collection and release.
• Toxicology screening.
• Release of information and evidence to criminal justice system personnel, SART/SARRT members,
and partnering service providers.
• Contact with patients for reasons related to their criminal sexual assault case.
• Patient notification in case of a DNA match or additional victims.
Patients should be informed that data without patient identity can be collected from the report for health and
forensic purposes by health authorities or other qualified persons with a valid educational or scientific interest
for demographic and/or epidemiologic studies.
Responders should coordinate efforts to seek patients’ consent. On a jurisdictional level, SART/SARRTs (or
involved responders if a SART/SARRT does not exist) can identify all procedures where consent is needed
during the exam process. They can make sure appropriate written consent forms are developed as well as
procedures for requesting verbal and written consent. They should determine which responder has the
knowledge needed to provide patients with information about each procedure and consider from whom
patients might feel the most comfortable receiving this information. For example, while each responder may
provide discipline-specific information to patients, advocates may provide a broad overview of all
components of the exam process. Checklists that clarify discipline-specific roles in obtaining consent may be
useful.
Make sure policies exist to guide the process of seeking informed consent from specific populations.
In order to provide informed consent, patients should be able to weigh the risks and benefits of different
treatment and evidence collection options. It is always important for examiners to assess patients’ ability and
legal capacity to provide informed consent.86 Providers should be aware of jurisdictional laws governing the
ability of specific populations to provide consent (e.g. minors, individuals with cognitive disabilities, etc.).
In addition, facilities should have internal policies based on applicable jurisdictional statutes governing
consent for treatment of vulnerable adult patients. The medical provider will generally need to assess
whether the patient has the cognitive capacity to give consent for the examination, and, if not, the provider
should follow these internal policies and jurisdictional statutes. Policies should include procedures to
86 Drawn partially from L. Ledray, SANE Development and Operation Guide, 2000, p.82.
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/publications/infores/sane/saneguide.pdf.
44determine whether or not patients are their own guardians; if there is a guardian, to determine the extent of
the guardianship; to obtain consent from a guardian if needed; and what to do if the guardian is not available
or is suspected of abuse or neglect. Exam facilities should also have policies in place to address consent for
treatment in cases in which patients are unconscious, intoxicated, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs,
and are therefore temporarily incompetent to give consent.
In cases of adolescent patients, jurisdictional statutes governing consent and access to the exam should be
followed. For instance, a state statute may allow minors to receive care for STIs and pregnancy, but not a
medical forensic examination without parental or guardian consent. In some jurisdictions, a minor may
consent to the examination but not keep the results private from a parent or legal guardian. Exceptions to
parental consent requirements also exist when the parent or guardian is the suspected offender or where the
parent or guardian can’t be found and the collection of evidence needs to be done quickly. In such cases, the
law generally specifies who may give consent in lieu of the parent or guardian, such as a police officer,
representative from the jurisdiction’s children’s services department, or judge.87
It should be clarified whether policies and statutes regarding consent for medical evaluation and treatment
for the above populations encompass consent for the forensic component of the exam. If not, additional
guidance from the jurisdiction is needed to develop the appropriate policies. Also, jurisdictional statutes
regarding mandatory reporting to law enforcement or protective services in cases of vulnerable adult and
minor sexual assault victims must be observed.
Examiners should develop policies and procedures for providing sexual assault care to the unconscious
patient. Such care should respect the autonomy of the individual and be consistent with jurisdictional
interpretations of emergency exceptions to informed consent. Policies should ideally be approved by hospital
ethics committees. Similarly, examiners should have policies for patients that present with altered mental
status, which could be from alcohol or drug intoxication or for other reasons. At a minimum, if serious
problems are ruled out, the patient will likely need to be observed until consent and cooperation can be
obtained which will delay the start of the examination.
In all cases, the medical forensic examination should never be done against the will of patients. Responders
should not touch patients or otherwise perform exam procedures without their permission.

45464. Confidentiality
Recommendations at a glance for jurisdictions to maintain confidentiality:
• Be sure jurisdictional policies address the scope and limitations of confidentiality as it relates to the
examination process and with whom information can be legally and ethically shared.
• Increase the understanding of relevant confidentiality issues.
• Consider the impact of the federal privacy laws regarding health information on victims of sexual assault.
• Strive to resolve intrajurisdictional conflicts.
Be sure jurisdictional policies address the scope and limitations of confidentiality as it relates to the
examination process and with whom information can be legally and ethically shared. The
confidentiality of records (as well as forensic evidence and photographic and video images) is intricately
linked to the scope of patients’ consent. Members of a SART/SARRT or other collaborating responders
should inform victims of the scope of confidentiality with each individual responding to the sexual assault
victim and be cautious not to exceed the limits of victim consent.
Increase the understanding of relevant confidentiality issues. Individuals responding to the sexual
assault victim need education on the basics of maintaining the confidentiality of their patients (e.g., knowing
what information is confidential and with whom confidential data can be shared, and being aware of their
surroundings and who may be listening when discussing cases). They also should build their understanding
of the scope and limitations of confidentiality of each agency and responder involved.
In addition, individuals responding to sexual assault victims should be aware of the laws in their jurisdiction
pertaining to privileged communications. 88 More than half of the states have laws in place providing some
level of privilege to the communications of sexual assault/rape crisis and domestic violence counselors. A
few states’ laws apply to victim counselors in general. In most states, counselors must complete a certain
number of training hours to qualify for the privilege. However, privileges vary from state to state.
Responders should be aware that victims in the military who choose restricted reports can confidentially
speak with a sexual assault victim advocate, a sexual assault response coordinator, military chaplain, or
other specified military professional. Jurisdictions should be careful in their local response to protect any
privileges that are available to victims. This can be done by limiting who speaks with the victim at each stage
of the process, who will be present during discussions and/or interviews, and who will be the recordkeeper or
notetaker.
In some jurisdictions, patients who are minors have fewer or more limited confidentiality rights than adults.
For example, in some jurisdictions, minor patients have the right to grant or withhold consent to a forensic
examination but not to keep the results of the exam private from their parent or legal guardian.
Involved responders should be able to explain the following to patients:
• Community-based advocates usually can provide patients with some level of confidentiality
(depending upon applicable jurisdictional statutes). It is important to convey to patients the scope
and limits of confidentiality of this communication. System-based advocates (such as those based in
police departments, prosecutor’s offices, or military installations) usually have limited or no ability to
keep information confidential.
88 Traditionally, many types of communication have been protected from disclosure in court. These include communication between
husband and wife, physician and patient, attorney and client, clergy and parishioner, and psychotherapist and patient. Confidential
communication generated in the course of a counseling relationship has more recently been afforded some statutory protection. In
general, victim-counselor privilege laws enable counselors (such as community-based victim advocates) to maintain confidentiality of
information revealed to them. This does not usually apply to system-based advocates, such as those in law enforcement departments or
prosecutor’s offices. In addition to preventing counselors from testifying in court, many privilege laws extend protection to their written
records. (Drawn from Privacy of Victims’ Counseling Communications, Office for Victims of Crime, Legal Series, Bulletin #8 (November
2002), pp. 1–2.)
47• Absent a court order, patients’ medical records are confidential—exam facilities typically have
policies in place to protect these records. It is important that patients understand the scope and limits
of confidentiality of these records.
• If the assault is reported to law enforcement, health care providers provide to the criminal justice
system information collected during the examination that is related to forensic evidence.
• If the victim chooses to get an exam, but not make a police report, the evidence collection kit is
typically held in a secure setting for a period of time as determined by jurisdictional policy. Patients’
identity should not be revealed to law enforcement. Patients usually need to make an official report
by the end of the designated period of time or the evidence and information will be destroyed.
• Information that patients share with law enforcement representatives, prosecutors, justice system
based advocates, and adult/child protective services becomes part of the criminal justice record. This
record is typically available to investigators and prosecutors handling the patient’s case. It also may
have to be provided to the defense pursuant to the government’s discovery obligations89 (although
prosecutors may request the court to shield certain information from the defense, such as history of
prior pregnancies, abortions, and STIs).90
• Each case potentially involves individuals from different agencies responding to the sexual assault
victim that may have their own confidentiality policies (e.g., school counselors and mental health
providers).
• Both prosecutors and defense attorneys can call witnesses, including responders, to testify in court;
• Court documents and proceedings are generally matters of public record, with the exception of
certain excluded materials (e.g., some states’ statutes prohibit victim contact information from
appearing on public court documents).
• Patients may at some point wish to view or obtain applicable medical records and/or law
enforcement reports. They should have access to such documentation, and exam site and
jurisdictional procedures for accessing this data should be conveyed to patients.
• Military members can confidentially91 report being sexually assaulted to specified officials within the
military and therefore can be eligible to receive medical care, counseling, and victim advocacy
services without requiring command notification or triggering the investigatory process. This is known
as restricted reporting. Release of the information regarding the sexual assault to anyone other than
the specified officials who may receive a restricted report will result in the loss of confidentiality for
the victim and command and law enforcement will have to be notified of the sexual assault.
Consider the impact of federal privacy laws regarding health information on victims of sexual
assault. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and its
implementing regulations (found at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164), established national
standards for the protection of certain individually identifiable health information created or held by health
plans, certain health care providers, and health clearinghouses. With respect to disclosures to victim
advocacy organizations, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits hospitals and other health care providers to alert a
victim advocacy organization to the presence of a victim of sexual assault at the hospital without giving any
identifying information about the victim. Further, once the advocate is at the hospital, if the victim is informed
in advance and agrees or does not object, or the hospital reasonably infers from the circumstances, based
on professional judgment, that the victim does not object, then the Privacy Rule permits hospital staff to
introduce the advocate to the victim and share information pertinent to the advocate’s involvement in the
victim’s care. For more information on the ability of a health care provider to communicate with persons
identified by an individual as involved in the individual’s care, see A Health Care Provider’s Guide to the
HIPAA Privacy Rule: Communicating with a Patient’s Family, Friends, or Others Involved in a Patient’s Care,
available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/provider_ffg.pdf.
89 Discovery in a criminal case is the turning over of any evidence or information that the prosecutor is obligated by jurisdictional statute
or case law to turn over to the defense. (Drawn from electronic communications with Norm Gahn, Assistant District Attorney, Office of
the District Attorney for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, during the fall of 2003.)
90 Depending on jurisdictional law, law enforcement reports and reports of other governmental agencies may be subject to open public
records laws or Freedom of Information Act laws. In such instances, jurisdictional policy would govern when such information could be
released to the general public upon request. (Drawn from electronic communications with Robert Laurino, Deputy Chief Assistant
Prosecutor, Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, New Jersey, during the fall of 2003.)
91 Within the U.S. Department of Defense’s Restricted Reporting Policy, a military member may make a restricted report to a Sexual
Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), victim advocate, or health care provider.
48For more information about the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally, including the conditions under which other
disclosures are permitted, visit the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR)
Web Site at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/ for an array of helpful guidance documents and Frequently
Asked Questions.
HIPAA is not the only federal law that governs victims’ privacy rights. Agencies that receive funding under
the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) must also comply with VAWA’s confidentiality provisions. These
provisions require that a victim’s personally identifying information may not be released without a victim’s
written, time-limited, informed consent or a court or statutory mandate.
Strive to resolve intrajurisdictional conflicts. For example, maintaining confidentiality is often difficult in
isolated or small communities where people know one another or word of a crime travels quickly (e.g., school
campuses and tribal, military, religious, or immigrant communities). Special precautions must be taken in
these situations to preserve confidentiality. Every effort should be made to avoid conflicts of interest (e.g., the
investigator is the cousin of the suspect or the health care provider, or the advocate or interpreter is an
acquaintance of the patient). Give patients as many options as possible to avoid these dilemmas (e.g., allow
them to work with a different investigator or be examined at another site or by another examiner, if possible).
49505. Reporting to Law Enforcement
Recommendations at a glance for jurisdictions and individual responding to the sexual assault victims to
facilitate victim-sensitive reporting practices:
• Except in situations covered by mandatory reporting laws, patients, not health care workers, make the
decision to report a sexual assault to law enforcement
• Inform patients about reporting consequences.
• As a result of VAWA 2005, many jurisdictions have implemented alternatives to standard reporting
procedures.
• Promote a victim-centered reporting process.
Many sexual assault victims who come to health care facilities or other exam sites for the medical forensic
exam choose to report the assault to law enforcement. Reporting provides the criminal justice system with
the opportunity to offer immediate protection to the victim, collect evidence from all crime scenes, investigate
the case, prosecute it if there is sufficient evidence, and hold the offender accountable for crimes committed.
Given the danger that sex offenders pose to the community, reporting can serve as a first step in efforts to
stop them from reoffending. Equally important, reporting gives the justice system the chance to encourage
victims to seek assistance to address their needs, identify patterns of sexual violence in the jurisdiction, and
educate the public about such patterns. Service providers should discuss all reporting options with victims
and the pros and cons of each, including the fact that delayed reporting may be detrimental to the
prosecution of an offender. Victims need to know that even if they are not ready to report at the time of the
exam, the best way to preserve their option to report later is to have the exam performed. Information should
be provided in a language victims understand.
Some victims, however, are unable to make a decision about whether they want to report or be involved in
the criminal justice system in the immediate aftermath of an assault. Pressuring these victims to report may
discourage their future involvement. Yet, they can benefit from support and advocacy, treatment, and
information that focuses on their well-being. Recognizing that traumatic injuries heal and evidence on their
bodies is lost as time passes and that they may report at a later date, victims can also be encouraged to
have the medical forensic exam conducted. Victims who are recipients of compassionate and appropriate
care at the time of the exam are more likely to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecution in the future.
Except in situations covered by mandatory reporting laws, patients, not health care workers, make
the decision to report a sexual assault to law enforcement. Health care workers in some jurisdictions are
bound by law to report some or all forms of sexual assault, regardless of patients’ wishes.92 In the remaining
jurisdictions, no report should be made without the consent of patients. (Exceptions typically include cases
involving vulnerable adults and minors victimized by caretakers or other authority figures). All involved health
care providers should be aware of the reporting requirements in the jurisdiction in which they work.
In jurisdictions in which mandatory reporting by health care personnel is required, patients should be
informed of the legal obligations of health care personnel, what triggers a mandatory report, that a report is
being made, and the contents of the report. Patients should understand that even if health care personnel
make a mandatory report, they are not obligated to talk with law enforcement officials93
92 Some jurisdictions mandate reporting for some or all violent crimes, requiring health care workers to notify law enforcement in cases
involving a gunshot or knife wound, strangulation/choking, or other serious bodily injury. They vary, however, in whether they require
acts of sexual violence without serious physical injuries to be reported. Health care personnel should be aware that these reporting laws
may come into conflict with military policy allowing for restricted reporting for victims in the military.
93 Some victims may fear possible consequences of reporting (e.g., retaliation by offenders; rejection by family members and friends;
being discriminated against if they are males). Victims may have these and other fears because they are from populations with differing
sexual orientations or gender identities, or they are from racially or otherwise oppressed groups; they are inmates; or they fear being
deported or refused citizenship (in the case of recent immigrants and refugees). Some recent immigrants or refugees may fear law
enforcement because of past experiences of oppression by authorities in their countries of origin. In addition, many victims are not
willing to deal with the humiliation, loss of privacy, and negativity they perceive would accompany reporting, an investigation, and
prosecution. If an intimate partner or a family member committed the assault, victims may also be concerned about the consequences of
51States are required, as a condition of eligibility for STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant funds, to
allow victims to receive examinations and to have the examinations paid for regardless of the level of
participation of victims in the criminal justice process. Documentation and evidence collected could be
invaluable to the investigation and prosecution if patients should report at a later date, which often occurs.
Patients also have the right to receive medical care for assault-related injuries and concerns, regardless of
their decision to report and/or have evidence collected, although the state is not required to pay for medical
care.
Jurisdictions need to consider the challenges of storing evidence in cases where victims go through the
medical forensic exam but opt not to participate with the criminal justice process. In some communities, it is a
challenge to find adequate space to hold evidence in cases where a report has not been made. For more
information on this topic, see B.6. Evidence Integrity.
In addition, under VAWA 2005 as a condition of STOP Formula Grant funding, states must also certify that
law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and other government officials do not ask or require victims of sex
offenses to submit to polygraph exams or other truth telling devices as a condition for proceeding with the
investigation or prosecution of the offense.
Inform patients about reporting consequences. Prior to making a decision about reporting, patients need
information about issues related to reporting. For example, they should be informed of the following:
• The process of reporting the sexual assault to law enforcement and the information that will typically
be requested from the victim.
• Procedures dealing with reporting in the jurisdictional protocol for immediate response to sexual
assault.
• Whether health care personnel are mandated by law to report the assault.
• The fact that the report will trigger an investigation. Depending upon the results of the investigation,
the case may be referred to the prosecutor, and the prosecutor may file charges.
• The purposes of the exam and how documented injuries as well as evidence gathered could be used
during investigation and prosecution.
• Types of evidence (beyond that found on patients) that may be gathered during an investigation.94
• The fact that delays in reporting, especially extended ones, can result in loss of evidence and may
negatively affect the ability of the criminal justice system to investigate and prosecute a case.95
• Practices regarding prosecution of sexual assault victims for unrelated criminal charges.
• The right to accept or decline exam procedures and the possible consequences of declining.
• The right to copies of any communication or report issued to law enforcement and procedures for
accessing such data.
• Policies related to payment for the exam, evidence collection, and medical care, whether or not a
report is made.
• Policies on collecting/holding evidence in cases where patients are undecided about reporting, and,
if evidence can be collected with no report, the amount of time they have to make a reporting
decision.
prosecution on their families (e.g., loss of income, employment, profession, attorney fees, and childcare costs) and being blamed for
“tearing the families apart.” Incest victims may be deterred from reporting because offender registries might indirectly identify them.
94 For example, other evidence may be found on the suspect’s bodies and clothing, at the locations of actual assaults, and locations
victims went to immediately after the assaults.
95 Prompt reporting can facilitate a thorough investigation. Collecting evidence from patients is but one piece of investigative information
gathering. Other investigative activities may include, but are not limited to, identifying and collecting evidence from all crime scenes;
identifying, apprehending, and interviewing suspects; interviewing witnesses (both eyewitnesses and persons to whom victims initially
disclose); obtaining search warrants as needed (e.g., to search for drugs that might have been used to facilitate an assault or for
evidence used during an assault such as clothing, ropes, or condoms). Investigative activities depend on the specifics of each case.
52In response to VAWA 2005, many jurisdictions have implemented alternatives to standard reporting
procedures.96 Many communities have implemented alternatives to traditional reporting procedures, such as
anonymous or blind reporting. These procedures are used when victims do not want to immediately report or
are undecided about reporting with their own name and contact information (but are willing to report
anonymously).97 Government entities that mandate reporting for sexual assaults, in particular, have
implemented an option of third-party anonymous reporting for mandated reports, which allow a third-party,
such as the medical personnel, to make the report without including identifying information about the victim.98
Although the practice of anonymous reporting is not widespread it allows victims and/or third-party reporters
to share critical information about the assault with law enforcement without sacrificing privacy. It also enables
investigators to gain information about sex crimes that would otherwise go unreported.
To develop an anonymous/blind reporting system, law enforcement agencies can:
• Establish and uphold a policy of victim confidentiality.
• Allow victims to disclose as little or as much information as they wish.
• Accept the information whenever victims might offer it—a delay in disclosure is not an indicator of the
validity of the statement.
• Develop procedures and forms to facilitate anonymous information from third parties (e.g.,
examiners).
• Clarify options with victims for future contact—where, how, and under what circumstances they may
be contacted by the law enforcement agency or by another agency.
• Maintain these reports in separate files from official complaints to avoid inappropriate use.
Informed consent from victims for notification should be sought during the initial report, as well as appropriate
times, reasons, and methods to recontact them.99 For example, a victim may want to be contacted if another
victim who was likely assaulted by the same suspect comes forward.
Promote a victim-centered reporting process. Some approaches for communities to consider:
• Explore the myriad reasons why victims are reluctant to report and how the actions or attitudes of
agencies may help perpetuate these fears. Help agencies consider how to address reluctance and
fears (e.g., immigrant victims who fear deportation and immigration enforcement may benefit from
immediate access to legal services or information about their rights as potential U-Visa holders).
Information regarding U-Visas should be universally provided to all victims. The resource, if not
appropriate for the victim being seen, may be passed along to others through word of mouth.100
• Evaluate local trends regarding reporting and victims’ involvement in the criminal justice system.
Based on feedback, develop and implement a plan to improve multidisciplinary response to sexual
assault.
• Improve and increase professional training for first responders (e.g., training for law enforcement
investigators on effective interviewing techniques for sexual assault victims, training for health care
personnel on the clear use of language in documentation, training for prosecutors on strategies for
96The first two paragraphs in this section are drawn from S. Garcia and M. Henderson, Blind Reporting of Sexual Violence, FBI Law
Enforcement Bulletin, June 1999, pp. 12–16.
97 For example, the Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Police Department’s blind reporting system for sexual assault enables victims to
disclose as much or as little information as they want. A detective records the information but does not initiate an investigation unless
victims decide to file a formal complaint. The blind reporting system has been credited with contributing to a steady increase in sexual
assault reporting. The number of male victims who reported during that time also rose. (K. Littel, M. Malefyt, and A. Walker, Assessing
the Justice System Response to Violence Against Women: A Tool for Law Enforcement, Prosecution, and the Courts to Use in
Developing Effective Response, 1998, pp. 18–9.)
98 For example, all health care providers in Massachusetts who attend to, treat, or examine a sexual assault patient are required to
submit a third-party anonymous report (with no identifying information) to law enforcement in the community where the assault occurred
as well as to the state police. This report is required even if patients report the assault themselves. (Commonwealth of Massachusetts
SANE Protocol, 2002, pp. 8–9.)
99 All those involved in immediate response, including victims, need to understand the nature of DNA evidence and how CODIS can be
used to match offenders with DNA in the database. They also need to know the status of CODIS in their jurisdiction (states have varying
laws regarding which crimes qualify for inclusion in the database).
100 Legal Momentum has extensive resources available regarding U-Visas. See http://www.legalmomentum.org/our-work/immigrant-
women-program/u-visa.html. Additionally, immigrant women are entitled to emergency medical and post-assault healthcare. For a state-
by-state breakdown of the benefits afforded, see http://www.legalmomentum.org/assets/pdfs/4_nilc_table_10.pdf.
53overcoming a consent defense, and training for first responders on effective use of interpreters when
responding to sexual assault cases).
• Encourage reporting of criminal justice statistics that accurately reflect the full range of sexual
assaults that are reported in a jurisdiction.
• Initiate community education, outreach, and services targeting groups that may be reluctant to seek
assistance after an assault.
• Expand community collaboration to include immigrant victim advocates who can work with the local
coordinating council and SART/SARRT to inform immigrant victims of their rights as soon as
possible post-assault.
• Offer viable options for reimbursement of exam costs for which victims are responsible, such as
costs that are purely medical in nature.101
• Ensure that victims who opt not to participate in the criminal justice process have access to the same
comprehensive medical forensic examination as those who do.
• Encourage the development of a coordinating council and/or SART/SARRT to facilitate a more
coordinated, victim-centered, comprehensive community response to sexual violence.
• Support the formation of specialized examiner programs, investigative and prosecution units, and
sexual assault victim advocacy programs to handle these cases. Specialization can potentially
increase the knowledge base and commitment of those responding to sexual assault victims,
increase adherence to jurisdictional protocols for immediate response to sexual assault, encourage a
victim-centered response, and positively advertise services offered.
• Develop jurisdiction-wide public information initiatives on mandatory reporting—mandatory reporters
need to know applicable statutes regarding reporting sexual assault cases that involve older
vulnerable adults, persons with disabilities, and minors. A toll-free hotline number exclusively
dedicated to abuse reports may also help simplify reporting and ensure a written report of each case
and referrals to appropriate agencies. Such a hotline could be operated at a state, tribal, regional, or
local level. To encourage both reporting and follow-through, protective agencies that investigate
these cases should work collaboratively with local law enforcement agencies to ensure that each
case is dealt with in the best possible manner and that further harm does not occur.102
• In institutional settings such as prisons, jails, immigrant detention centers, nursing homes and
assisted living programs, inpatient treatment centers, and group homes, ensure that victims can
report assaults to outside agencies and are offered protection from retaliation for reporting.
• In each case, strive to create an environment in which victims are supported and respected
throughout the criminal justice process and beyond.103
• After steps have been taken to identify and remove barriers to reporting sexual assaults, educate the
public about the potential benefits of reporting, how to go about reporting, what happens once a
report is filed, and jurisdictional legal advocacy services available (if any) for sexual assault victims.
Build upon already existing public awareness efforts of local advocacy programs.
101 It would be ideal if victims did not have to cover any costs for the exam and related medical care. However, jurisdictions and exam
facilities vary in the costs that victims are required to cover. In some jurisdictions, victims are responsible for the costs of treatment for
injuries and possible pregnancy, STIs, and HIV infection. Some exam facilities are flexible—they may allow victims to pay as they are
financially able or may be willing to waive some or all charges.

546. Payment for the Examination Under VAWA
Recommendations at a glance for jurisdictions to facilitate payment for the sexual assault medical forensic
exam:
• Understand the VAWA provisions related to exam payment.
• Notify victims of exam facility and jurisdictional policies regarding payment for medical care and the
medical forensic exam.
Understand the VAWA provisions related to exam payment.104 Under the Violence Against Women Act
(VAWA) and subsequent legislation, grantees of the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant
Program must meet certain requirements concerning payment for the forensic medical exam in order to
receive funds. The STOP Program is a formula grant program which provides funds to all states, Territories,
and the District of Columbia.105
Each of these entities certifies each year that it is in compliance with the requirements of VAWA. 106
Specifically, the state, territory, or the District of Columbia must certify that it or another governmental entity
"incurs the full out-of-pocket cost of forensic medical exams" for victims of sexual assault. If one part of a
state or territory, such as a county or city, is forcing victims to incur these costs, then the state or territory will
not be able to certify and will be ineligible for the grant funds. In addition, under the Violence Against Women
Act of 2005, states must also certify that they do not require victims to participate with the criminal justice
process in order to be provided with an exam.107
States are permitted to use STOP Program funds to pay for the exams if they meet two conditions.108 First,
the exam must be performed by a “trained examiner for victims of sexual assault.” Second, the state may
not require victims of sexual assault to seek reimbursement from their insurance carriers.
In cases of victims associated with the U.S. military services, sexual assault forensic examinations may be
covered under Tricare for service members.
By regulation, "full out-of-pocket cost” means “any expense that may be charged to a victim in connection
with a medical forensic examination for the purpose of gathering evidence of a sexual assault.”109 Examples
of such expenses may include the full cost of the exam or a fee established by the facility conducting the
exam, or a copayment or deductible in jurisdictions that require victims to submit the charges to insurance.
Often, medical services that are not related to evidence gathering will not be covered by this requirement.
Notify victims of exam facility and jurisdictional policies regarding payment for medical care and the
medical forensic exam. Victims must be aware of exam facility and jurisdictional policies regarding payment
for other medical care related to the sexual assault. Many jurisdictions will not pay for medical care provided
as part of the medical forensic examination, such as the costs of treatment for injuries or treatment for STIs,
or may require victims to apply separately for crime victim compensation to be reimbursed for such
104 As a result of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, states can no longer pay for exams by reimbursing the
victim, instead they need to either provide the exams free of charge to the victim or arrange for victim to obtain the exams free of charge
to the victims.
105 Its purpose is to assist these jurisdictions in developing and strengthening law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat
violence against women, as well as in developing and strengthening victim services in cases involving violence against women.
106 For American Indian/Alaska Native victims, the costs of the exam will be born by either the state or in some cases the federal
government. Although tribes are not directly eligible for STOP Formula Grants, they are eligible for subgrants from the states, as well as
other Office on Violence Against Women grant programs that can address sexual assault.
107 Under 42 U.S.C. § 10607, a federal investigating agency that conducts a sexual assault investigation shall pay for the cost of a
forensic exam "which an investigating officer determines was necessary or useful for evidentiary purposes." However, in most cases
where the victim does not choose to report the assault to law enforcement or to participate with the criminal justice process, a state that
receives STOP funds will still be responsible for payment because at that stage there will be no federal investigation. The state’s
responsibility for payment applies regardless of whether the crime occurred in Indian Country or within the special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
108 42 U.S.C. 3796gg-4(c).
109 28 C.F.R. § 90.14(a).
55expenses. Individuals responding to the sexual assault victim need to be informed regarding payment
policies and procedures for all aspects of the medical forensic examination, so that they can accurately
inform victims.110 For example, responders can help them apply for crime victims’ compensation (if available)
or arrange a payment plan with the exam facility.111 When victims are billed by the exam facility for costs that
are their responsibility, procedures to protect their privacy should be incorporated into the billing process.
Personnel in facility billing departments should be educated regarding coding and billing practices in these
cases, as determined by facility and/or jurisdictional policy.
Reporting to law enforcement. States, territories, and the District of Columbia must pay for sexual assault
medical forensic exams without requiring victims to report the assault to law enforcement. Some victims are
unable to make a decision about whether they want to report to law enforcement in the immediate aftermath
of the assault. Recognizing that injuries heal and that evidence is lost as time progresses, victims should be
encouraged to have the physical findings documented and evidence collected right away, and then have
time to decide about reporting the crime.
See http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/faq-forensic-examinations.html and http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/stop-
formula-faq.pdf for more information on the STOP Formula Grant Program medical forensic exam payment
requirement.
110 Victims in federal cases should first apply to the state or territory crime victim compensation program for reimbursement of costs that
are their responsibility. If they are unable to obtain reimbursement via this channel, they should work with victim-witness specialists in
the federal agency investigating or prosecuting the case to identify other possible sources of funding or reimbursement. For more
information about crime victim compensation, please see http://www.ovc.gov/publications/factshts/compandassist/welcome.html.
111 Exam facilities are sometimes willing to waive some related medical care costs that are not covered by government entities.
56B. Operational Issues
This section discusses components essential to conducting the sexual assault forensic examination: the
health care providers conducting the exam, the facilities where exams are performed, the equipment and
supplies needed during the exam, and the sexual assault evidence collection kit. It also discusses timing
considerations in collecting evidence and evidence integrity during and after the exam.
The following chapters are included:
1. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners
2. Facilities
3. Equipment and Supplies
4. Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit
5. Timing Considerations for Collecting Evidence
6. Evidence Integrity
57581. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners
Recommendations at a glance to build capacity of examiners to conduct these exams:
• Encourage the development of specific knowledge, skills, and victim-centered approaches in examiners.
• Encourage advanced education and supervised clinical practice of examiners, as well as certification for
all examiners.
• Provide access to experts on anti-sexual assault initiatives who can participate in sexual assault
examiner training, mentoring, proctoring, case review, photograph review, and quality assurance.
It is critical that health care providers conducting the sexual assault medical forensic exam are committed to
providing compassionate and competent health care, collecting evidence in a thorough and appropriate
manner, and testifying in court if needed. Their commitment should be grounded in an understanding that
sexual assault is a serious crime that can have profound acute and chronic consequences for those
victimized. Providers should recognize the role of advanced education and clinical experience in building
competency to perform the exam.
A growing trend across the United States is the use of sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) to conduct
the exam. SANEs are registered nurses who receive specialized education and fulfill clinical requirements to
perform these exams. Some nurses have been certified as SANEs–Adult and Adolescent (SANE–A) through
the International Association of Forensic Nurses (IAFN).112 Others are specially educated and fulfill clinical
requirements as forensic nurse examiners (FNEs), enabling them to collect forensic evidence for a variety of
crimes. The terms “sexual assault forensic examiner” (SAFE) and “sexual assault examiner” (SAE) are often
used more broadly to denote a health care provider (e.g., a physician, physician assistant, nurse, or nurse
practitioner) who has been specially educated and completed clinical requirements to perform this exam.
All communities should strive to ensure that victims of a recent sexual assault have access to specially
educated and clinically prepared examiners to perform the medical forensic exam. As much as possible,
examiners should be permanent rather than on temporary assignment in a jurisdiction. It can be challenging
for examiners who are temporary (e.g., at an Indian Health Service facility) to understand needs of victims
from the community or to be familiar with jurisdictional policies and procedures. If they move to another job
assignment, arranging for them to testify in court can be complicated.113
Encourage the development of specific knowledge, skills, and victim-centered approaches in
examiners. Conducting a sexual assault medical forensic examination is a complex and time-consuming
procedure. It is useful for examiners to have specific knowledge and skills that can guide them as they
perform these exams.114 For example, it is beneficial for them to know about the following:
• The dynamics and impact of sexual victimization.
• Jurisdictional laws related to sexual offenses.
• Coordinated multidisciplinary response, roles of each responding agency, and procedures for
communicating with each agency during immediate response.
• The importance of examiner neutrality and objectivity during the examination.
112 Eligibility criteria for IAFN SANE Adult/Adolescent certification includes: registered license as an R.N. in the United States or its
Territories, or a license as a first-level general nurse in the jurisdiction of current practice; a minimum of 2 years of practice as an R.N. in
the United States or as a first-level general nurse in the country of licensure; successful completion of an adult/adolescent SANE
education program that includes either (a) a minimum of 40 continuing education contact hours of classroom instruction, or (b) 3
semester hours (or the equivalent) of academic credit in an accredited school of nursing, and sufficient supervised clinical practice until
determined competent in SANE practice. An appropriate clinical authority, as outlined in the adult section of the IAFN SANE Education
Guidelines (2008) must validate current SANE competency. (Drawn from the IAFN Web Site Certification Area at http://www.iafn.org.)
113 Most hospitals or medical clinics that physicians or advanced practice nurses are employed by or affiliated with require them to apply
for facility privileges. Those requesting privileges usually must agree to provide forwarding addresses when they leave. Also, medical
licenses can be tracked to the state or territory where the health care provider is working.
114 The next two bulleted sections are adapted from the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual
Abuse Victims, 2001, pp. 25–26, produced by the California Governor’s Office of Criminal Justice Planning. Also see the National
Training Standards..
59• The broad spectrum of potential evidence and physical findings in these cases.
• The importance of the medical forensic history and other documentation.
• Proper evidence collection and preservation procedures.
• Preexisting needs and circumstances of patients that may affect how the exam is conducted.
• Treatment options and procedures for common concerns such as pregnancy, STIs, and HIV
infection.
• Equipment, supplies, and medication typically used during the exam.
• Precautions to prevent exposure to potentially infectious materials.115
• Indications for follow-up health care and documentation of injuries.
• Applicable laws and protocols regarding performance of medical forensic exams and standardized
forms used to document findings.
• Patients’ needs for support, crisis intervention, advocacy, information, and referrals during the exam
process, local resources for addressing these needs, and procedures for accessing resources.
• The importance of establishing vehicles to ensure the quality of the exam and related
documentation.
• Examiner court testimony (what it involves and how examiners can prepare for it).
• Applicable research findings, technological advances, and promising practices.
It is critical for examiners to be able to:
• Preserve their neutrality and objectivity in each case.
• Assess patients’ clinical condition (physical and psychological assessment116) and provide
appropriate treatment and medical referrals (e.g., to a surgeon).
• Adapt exam procedures to address patients’ needs and circumstances as much as possible.
• Take measures during the exam process to reduce the likelihood of patients’ retraumatization.
• Take precautions according to facility policy to prevent exposure to potentially infectious materials.
• Contact advocates (where available) upon initial contact with patients so they can offer patients
support, crisis intervention, advocacy, information, and community referrals before, during, and after
the exam.117
• Explain the obligation and scope of mandatory reporting to the patient, if mandatory reporting is
required.
• Gather information sensitively from patients for a medical forensic history and use the history as a
guide when performing an exam.
• Explain to patients what items need to be collected for evidence and for what purposes.
• Involve law enforcement representatives promptly if patients want to report and work with them to
optimize the collection of evidence from patients, suspects, and crime scenes.
• Identify and describe pertinent genital and anorectal anatomical structures and external landmarks.
115 See the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard
(CFR 1910.1030). It may be accessed at http://www.osha.gov or by calling 800–321–0SHA. According to this standard, bloodborne
pathogens are pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. Among other things, the
standard requires employers who have employees at risk for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens and other potentially
infectious materials to develop plans to eliminate or minimize employee exposure. It also advises universal precautions that should be
observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials (this approach treats all human blood and certain human
body fluids as if they are known to be infectious). In addition, the standard requires employers to ensure that all employees at risk
participate in a training program to inform them of risks, related facility policies, and necessary precautions. Employers must also
establish and maintain a record for each employee with occupational exposure.
116 Examiners typically assess patients’ psychological functioning to determine whether there is a risk for suicide and whether patients
are oriented to person, place, and time. They may request a mental health evaluation for patients, if necessary.
117 It is helpful if jurisdictions clarify the specific roles of advocates and examiners during the exam process. In the absence of advocates
or other victim service providers, examiners may be responsible for providing crisis intervention and support to patients. In situations
where examiners are both collectors of evidence and crisis counselors, it is important to understand how these dual roles affect the
perception of their ability to testify in an unbiased manner.
60• Identify and document injuries and interpret physical findings; this documentation should include a
diagram of the finding on an appropriate anatomic drawing, a written description of the finding
(including any indication of tenderness or induration), and forensic imaging of any visible finding.
• Use enhancement techniques for detection and documentation of findings.
• Collect and preserve evidence for analysis by the crime laboratory.
• Collect and preserve toxicology samples in suspected alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault
cases.
• Maintain and document the chain of custody for evidence.
• Maintain the integrity of the evidence to ensure that optimal lab results are obtained.
• Evaluate the possibility of STIs and HIV infection and provide prophylactics and/or treatment.
• Assess pregnancy risk and discuss treatment options with the patient.
• Recognize evidence-based conclusions and limitations in the analysis of findings.
• Complete standard forms for documenting the medical forensic results of the exam.
• Discuss evidentiary findings with investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys as requested
(according to jurisdictional policy).
• Testify in court if needed.
Encourage advanced education and supervised clinical practice for health care personnel
conducting the exam, as well as certification for all examiners. Such a standard must speak to specific
education and supervision needs of involved disciplines. For example, nonphysician examiners may require
medical supervision and backup, in addition to completing necessary training and clinical requirements.
Certification through the IAFN is currently available only to nurses trained as SANEs. When designing
classroom education for examiners, make sure the examiners understand the importance of a
multidisciplinary response during the exam process. Consider involving trainers from health care, advocacy,
law enforcement, prosecution, judiciary, and crime laboratories.
Standardized curricula on sexual assault exams in medical school, nursing and nurse practitioner programs,
and physician assistant programs are recommended. Consideration must be given to how to systematically
secure, supervise, and retain examiners in/for poor, rural, or remote areas, institutional settings,118 military
bases, college campuses, tribal lands, migrant farm worker communities, and other areas needing increased
victim outreach. Examiners need to know how to respond in a respectful manner to various populations
within their community (e.g., local tribal victim service providers may be able to provide training on cultural
beliefs and practices that might be relevant in sexual assault cases).
In addition, other health care providers who come into contact with patients who disclose a recent assault
need information on procedures for obtaining immediate patient assistance and caring for patients prior to
their arrival at the exam site.
Provide access to experts on anti-sexual assault/violence initiatives who can participate in sexual
assault examiner training, mentoring, proctoring, case review, photograph review, and quality
assurance. Access to such experts can help increase examiner competence and the consistency of high
quality forensic examinations. Telemedicine may help provide this expertise, especially to rural and
underserved areas.
118 Examples of institutional settings include prisons, jails, immigration detention centers, juvenile detention centers, nursing homes,
assisted living and rehabilitation programs, and inpatient treatment centers.
61622. Facilities
Recommendations at a glance to build the capacity of health care facilities to respond to sexual assault
cases:
• Recognize the obligation of health care facilities to serve sexual assault patients in a culturally and
linguistically appropriate manner.
• Ensure that exams are conducted at sites served by examiners with advanced education and clinical
experience, if possible.
• Explore possibilities for optimal site locations.
• Communities may wish to consider developing basic requirements for designated exam sites.
• If a transfer from one health care facility to a designated exam site is necessary, use a protocol that
minimizes time delays and loss of evidence and addresses patients’ needs.
Recognize the obligation of health care facilities to serve sexual assault patients in a culturally and
linguistically appropriate manner.119 It is essential that all sexual assault patients who present to health
care facilities be thoroughly evaluated. Treating injuries alone is not sufficient in these cases. Staff who
examine these patients must be educated and clinically prepared to collect evidence and document findings
while maintaining the chain of custody. They should be able to coordinate crisis intervention and support for
patients, as well as provide STI evaluation and care, pregnancy assessment, and discuss treatment options.
They must be aware of and follow jurisdictional reporting policies, and be able to provide court testimony if
necessary.
The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)120 requires emergency and
ambulatory care facilities to have established policies for identifying and assessing possible victims of sexual
assault. It also requires staff to be trained on these policies. As part of the assessment process, JCAHO
requires these facilities to define their responsibilities related to the collection and preservation of evidentiary
materials.121 Sexual assault examiner programs are helping many health care facilities to carry out these
requirements. Facilities should also familiarize themselves with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment
and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which has provisions pertaining to the ability of hospitals to turn away
patients with emergency medical conditions.122
Ensure that exams are conducted at sites served by examiners with advanced education and clinical
experience, if possible. Some jurisdictions designate specific facilities as exam locations because they
employ or have ready access to specially educated and clinically prepared examiners, as well as the
necessary space, equipment, supplies, and policies to facilitate the exam process. Jurisdictions may rely on
examiner programs to serve multiple exam sites within a specific area.123 Communities can benefit from
designated exam facilities and examiner programs that use specially educated and clinically prepared
examiners to conduct the exam because they:
• Increase the quality of care for patients and attention to their needs.
• Increase the likelihood of a state-of-the-art examination.
119 This and the next paragraph were drawn from L. Ledray, Evidence Collection and Care of the Sexual Assault Survivor: The SANE-
SART Response, 2001, p. 1.
120 JCAHO standards for accreditation address a health care organization’s level of performance in specific areas—not just what the
organization is capable of doing, but what it actually does. The standards set forth maximum achievable performance expectations for
activities that affect the quality of care. These standards are developed in consultation with health care experts, providers, measurement
experts, purchasers, and consumers, and usually are updated every 2 years. (Drawn from
http://www.jointcommission.org/standards_information/standards.aspx).
121 The JCAHO requirements are discussed at
http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/commissioned/2forensicevidence/2forensicevidence.html.
122 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd. See http://www.emtala.com for more information about EMTALA.
123 A mobile examiner program may be based in a health care facility—in addition to providing services at that facility, it also may
contract with other exam sites to provide services as requested. Such a program may also be independent, with administrative offices
only, and solely contract with exam sites to provide examiner services.
63• Enhance a coordinated team approach.
• Encourage quality control (e.g., through use of competent and dedicated examiners, established
procedures for evidence collection, and standards for medical care).
Explore possibilities for optimal site locations. SART/SARRTs (or involved agencies) should determine
where exams should be conducted. Some factors to consider when identifying sites include safety and
security for patients and staff, physical and psychological comfort for patients, capacity to accommodate
victims with disabilities,124 availability of examiners with advanced education and clinical experience, access
to a pharmacy for medication, access to medical support services for care of injuries, access to lab services,
and access to the supplies and equipment needed to complete an exam.125 Decisions about site location
should reflect the needs of victims (e.g., for accessible care close to their home and local referrals), what is
most efficient for the multidisciplinary response team, and the need to maintain the neutrality and objectivity
of examiners (e.g. if the site location is at a rape crisis center, it may be seen as biased against the offender).
Designated facilities may be in hospitals, health clinics, mobile health units, or other alternative sites,
including family justice centers126 or nonprofit sexual assault victim services programs.127 The majority of
medical forensic exams are conducted in hospital emergency departments. This location typically offers
some level of security, is open 24 hours a day, and provides access to a wide array of medical and support
services. Clinical staff often have the experience and expertise to perform the exam and collaborate with
appropriate disciplines. Some jurisdictions have or are developing specialized hospital or community-based
examiner programs.128
SART/SARRTs may need to decide whether a tribal, local, regional, or state/territorial system of designated
facilities best serves community needs. Some issues that might impact this decision include community
demographics and geography; the need for and availability of specialized services; availability of local health
care facilities; local capacity to secure competent examiners and necessary space, equipment, and supplies;
willingness of involved disciplines to coordinate with a local facility or examiner program; distance to/from
tribal, regional, or state/territorial facilities; and service capacity of tribal, regional or state/territorial facilities.
Communities are encouraged to first consider using local designated exam sites. However, some may
ultimately opt for tribal-, regional- or state/territorial-level facilities. For example, a small state, tribe, or
sparsely populated region may establish one or more designated facilities to serve all of its localities.
Exam facilities and examiners that serve at the local level may benefit from networking with examiners in
other facilities or areas for support for peer review of medical forensic reports, quality assurance, and
information sharing (e.g., on training opportunities, practices, and referrals for patients).
Communities may wish to consider developing basic requirements for designated exam sites.
Examples of such requirements include:129
• The site will be within a reasonable distance from any point in the area it serves (“reasonable” is
locally defined).
• The site will promptly alert a SART/SARRT member, if one exists, when sexual assault patients
arrive.
• Urgent or emergent physical injuries (or other acute medical needs) will be treated immediately.
124 Title II and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act explains requirements for facilities in accommodating persons with
disabilities (which may vary depending on the type of facility). Title II prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in all
programs, activities, and services of public entities. Title III requires places of public accommodation to make reasonable modification in
their policies, practices, and procedures in order to accommodate individuals with disabilities. See http://www.ada.gov/ for related
information and resources.

126 Particularly on tribal land that is devoid of or a significant distance from a hospital, and the tribe is serviced by an Indian Health
Service (IHS) facility; consideration should be given to securing and maintaining examiners and necessary space, equipment, and
supplies to conduct these exams. Ideally, all IHS facilities should have examiners and a minimum standard for examiner training.

Victims, pp.10–11.

64• Responding examiners will be competent in their knowledge and skills.
• The site will ensure that admissions staff have the necessary resources and knowledge to best
accommodate the patient until the examiner or victim advocate arrives.
• The site will arrange for interpretation as needed in patients’ preferred languages and/or obtain
devices that facilitate communication for individuals with sensory or communication disabilities.
• Patients will be provided with a comprehensive medical forensic exam and resources to address
their immediate emotional and psychological needs.
• The site will provide a private, secure, and quiet waiting area for patients and for personal support
persons accompanying them.
• The site will provide a private and secure setting for the investigative interview.
• The site will provide a private exam room and other measures to assure patients’ privacy.
• The site will have a bathroom (preferably with shower facilities) available for patients’ use following
completion of the exam.
• The site or examiner program that serves the site will have/provide proper equipment and supplies to
facilitate a comprehensive exam (“proper equipment and supplies” are locally defined).
• The site or examiner program that serves the site will have a mechanism to ensure that evidence
collection kits are available and up to date.
• Patients will be offered medications for possible exposure to sexually transmitted infections.
• Patients will be assessed for pregnancy risk, informed about treatment options, and offered
treatment.
• Patients will be offered information about how exams are paid for in their jurisdiction and
reimbursement sources (if they exist) for related expenses that are their responsibility.
• Site billing departments will adhere to proper coding and billing practices for sexual assault cases, as
determined by the facility and informed by jurisdictional policy.
If designated facilities or sites served by examiner programs are selected, their success depends on getting
information about them to victims and agencies that provide immediate response or refer victims for
treatment and evidence collection. At a minimum, the list of designated exam sites should be provided to all
local hospitals, law enforcement agencies, emergency medical services, sexual assault victim advocacy
programs, and protective services. Promoting community public awareness about these sites is also
important given that victims may first disclose an assault to family members, friends, teachers, faith-based
leaders, employers, coworkers, and others. In addition, success will depend on interagency cooperation in
explaining facility options to victims and transporting them to designated exam sites (with their permission).
Law enforcement representatives and advocates may need guidance on how to recommend an exam
location to victims without mandating that they go to a specific site.
If a transfer from one health care facility to a designated exam site is necessary, use a protocol that
minimizes time delays and loss of evidence and addresses patients’ needs.130 Avoid transferring sexual
assault patients whenever possible. If transfer is necessary, explore options to ensure that the patient’s
comfort is prioritized. Every transfer can destroy evidence and cause patients further stress. However, if a
sexually assaulted individual arrives at a health care facility that, for some reason, is not able to provide a
medical forensic exam, interagency transfer procedures must be in place to transfer that individual to the
nearest designated exam site. Evidence should be preserved when examining, treating, or transferring
patients and providers should take care to preserve the chain of custody of such evidence. If there are acute
medical or psychological injuries that must be treated immediately, treatment should be provided at the initial
receiving facility. It may be helpful to offer patients support and advocacy from advocates at both the
receiving facility and exam site. A copy of all records, including any X-rays taken, should be transported with
patients to the exam facility. (However, it may not be necessary to send all medical records if patients’
medical needs are met before they are transferred to a nonmedical exam site for evidence collection.) All
health care facilities receiving federal funds, including Medicare and Medicaid payments, are required to
screen patients medically before transferring them to another exam site.131

Collection Protocol, 1998, p. 14.
131 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395dd.
65Patients have a right to decline a transfer. They should be aware, however, of the impact of refusing transfer,
as it may negatively affect the quality of care, the usefulness of evidence collection, and, ultimately, any
criminal investigation and/or prosecution. They should understand that declining a transfer might also be
used to discredit them in court. Providers should carefully discuss with patients the benefits of the transfer,
the possible benefits of refusing the transfer and the drawbacks of both options, so that patients can make
an informed decision. Providers should avoid pressuring patients to accept a transfer.
663. Equipment and Supplies
Recommendations at a glance to ensure proper equipment and supplies are available for exams:
• Consider what equipment and supplies are necessary to conduct a medical forensic exam.
• Address cost barriers to obtaining necessary equipment and supplies.
Examiners should know how to use all equipment and supplies (including medications) properly during the
exam. It is important that examiners and other individuals involved in sexual assault cases stay abreast of
the latest research on the use of equipment and supplies used in caring for sexual assault patients and/or
collecting evidence from them.
Consider what equipment and supplies are necessary to conduct a medical forensic exam. Plan to
have the following equipment and supplies readily available for the exam, according to jurisdictional
policies: 132
• A copy of the most current exam protocol used by the jurisdiction.
• Standard exam room equipment and supplies for a physical assessment and pelvic exam. Access
for patients with physical disabilities should be taken into account.133
• Comfort supplies for patients, even if minimal. Suggested items: clean and ideally new replacement
clothing, toiletries, food and drink, and a phone or at least easy access to a phone in as private a
location as possible. It is also important during the exam process to help patients obtain items they
request related to their spiritual healing.134 It may be useful for facilities to have items on hand that
are commonly requested in that jurisdiction (e.g., things that are used for local tribal traditional
healing practices) and policies for their use in the facility.135
• Sexual assault evidence collection kits and related supplies. (See B.4. Sexual Assault Evidence
Collection Kit for information on minimal kit contents.) Related supplies might include tweezers, tape,
nail clippers and scrapers, scissors, collection paper, saline solution or distilled water, extra swabs,
sterile containers, envelopes, paper bags, and pens/pencils.
• A method or device to dry evidence. Drying evidence is critical to preventing the growth of mold and
bacteria that can destroy an evidentiary sample. With any drying method or device used, ensure
minimal contamination of evidence, and maintain the chain of custody. The kit’s design can also aid
in the drying process (e.g., by providing clear instructions and supplies to allow drying to occur).
• A camera and related supplies (using the most up-to-date technology possible) for forensic
photography during initial and follow-up examinations. Related supplies might include digital media,
batteries and/or charger, a flash, a color bar, and a scale ruler for size reference. (Also see C.5.
Photography.)
• Testing and treatment supplies needed to evaluate and care for patients medically (follow exam
facility policies). Also, testing supplies may be needed that are not included in the evidence collection
kit. For example, supplies for toxicology testing are often not in the kit.
• An alternate light source (using the most up-to-date technology possible) can aid in examining
patients’ bodies, hair, and clothing. It can be used to scan for evidence, such as dried or moist
132 All the equipment and supplies discussed will not be needed in every exam. What is appropriate in each case will depend on the
circumstances of the assault and medical and forensic attention called for, patients’ needs, and patients’ consent to utilize equipment
and supplies. Jurisdictional and/or facility policies will also influence what equipment and supplies are used.
133 For example, it would be ideal to have an exam table with a hydraulic lift for persons with mobility impairments. If this exam table is
not available, health care personnel must be aware of how to assist patients with physical disabilities onto standard exam tables. If it is
determined that a patient can only be examined on an exam table with a hydraulic lift, procedures should be in place to get the patient to
a site with such a table with as little loss of evidence as possible.
134 Along with these items, patients may want the opportunity to speak with a trusted religious or spiritual leader, such as a medicine
man/woman, a rabbi, a priest, or a pastor, before, during, or after the exam.
135 Involved responders/facilities should be aware of local traditional healing practices and support patients if they wish to use such
practices at some point before, during, or after the exam. Keep in mind that each tribe has its own traditional practices to promote
healing, but not all Native people follow traditional spiritual paths. Rather, spiritual values and belief systems among Native people are
as widely diverse as they are among the general population.
67secretions, fluorescent fibers not visible in ambient light, and subtle injury.136 While the exam can be
done without a light source, it is a relatively inexpensive piece of equipment that is commonly used
during exams.137 (Also see C.6. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures.)
• An anoscope may be used in cases involving potential anorectal penetration or anal/rectal trauma.138
This instrument may be used to assist in visualizing an anal injury, obtaining reliable rectal swabs (if
there is a concern about contamination), and identifying and collecting trace evidence. (Also see C.6.
Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures.)
• Written materials for patients. (For details on this topic, see A.2. Victim-Centered Care.)
In addition:
• A colposcope with photographic capability may be used. Although some injuries can be detected
visually by examiners without the colposcope, the colposcope is an important asset in the
identification of microscopic trauma. Photographic equipment, both still and video, can be attached
for forensic documentation. (Also see C.6. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures.)
• A microscope. In some jurisdictions, examiners are required to prepare a wet mount slide and
immediately examine vaginal/cervical secretions for motile and nonmotile sperm.139 In these cases,
an optically staining microscope is used to highlight cellular material and facilitate the search for
sperm.140 (Also see C.6. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures.)
• Toluidine blue dye. In some jurisdictions, the dye is used to assist in highlighting observed genital
and perianal injuries. (Also see C.6. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures.)
(See C. The Examination Process for more discussion on use of equipment and supplies during the exam. )
Note that some jurisdictions, particularly those in rural and remote areas, are beginning to utilize advanced
technology (equipment and methods) such as real-time video consultation, store and forward video
consultation, and interactive video consultation to support examiners conducting exams. Using this type of
technology, examiners can eliminate the barriers of geography and consult with offsite medical “experts.”
(This use of such technology in medicine is sometimes called telemedicine.) Equipment needed to facilitate
use of telemedicine may include, but is not limited to, computers, software programs, and the Internet.141
Jurisdictions that use such technology should consider ways to protect victim confidentiality.
Address cost barriers to obtaining necessary equipment and supplies. Obtaining equipment and
supplies that can increase the quality and quantity of evidence collected can have a significant impact on
case outcomes. However, the costs of equipment and training on equipment use can be prohibitive for some
jurisdictions and examiner programs. Some ideas to address cost barriers:
• Seek used or donated equipment or alternative, less-expensive equipment where it exists.
136 Drawn from the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p. 37.
137 A Wood’s Lamp is perhaps the most commonly used type of light source in sexual assault exams. Examiners should be aware of
what the light sources they use will detect and their limitations. For example, many examiners find the Wood’s Lamp useful in helping to
detect secretions, stains, and fibers on patients. However, one research study questioned its utility as a screening device for the
detection of semen. (K. Santucci, D. Nelson, K. McQuillen, S. Duffy, and J. Linakis, “Wood’s Lamp Utility in the Identification of Semen,”
Pediatrics, 104(6), 1999.) Continued research is needed (and being conducted) on the utility of this and other light sources in evidence
collection. Ongoing refinement of these instruments is encouraged.
138 The examiner should use discretion in determining whether a case warrants the use of the anoscope for medical and/or forensic
purposes, as well as obtain patients’ informed consent for anoscopy. Particularly if a patient has been anorectally penetrated, that
patient may be uncomfortable with the use of the anoscope and could possibly even feel revictimized by it. The discomfort this
procedure may cause the patient should be weighed against its potential medical or forensic benefits.
139 Wet-mount evaluation of vaginal secretions for infection (e.g., yeast infection and STIs) may be conducted if medically or forensically
indicated, whether or not wet-mount evaluation for sperm is done. Hospital lab personnel rather than examiners usually analyze these
samples.
140 The most commonly used optically staining instrument by hospital labs is the phase contrast microscope. In jurisdictions that require
examiners to do wet-mount evaluations for sperm, an optically staining microscope should be readily available to them at all times.
Ideally, due to chain-of-custody issues and the fact that the slide will dry in 5 to 10 minutes, examiners should not have to leave the
exam room to evaluate the slide.
141 Keep in mind that telemedicine in sexual assault cases is in its infancy—further research and debate is needed to address concerns
related to logistics of use, patients’ consent, confidentiality, and impact; legal implications; affordability; and accessibility.
68• Apply for grant or foundation funding for equipment where eligible.142
• Ask for help from community groups in raising funds for one-time equipment or ongoing supply costs;
• Consider sharing costs and equipment with other departments in an exam facility or among other
near-by local health care facilities.
• Consider the benefits of a mobile examiner program where costs of equipment, examiner education
and clinical preparation, and on-call costs may be shared by multiple exam sites.
• Since the information gathered in the exam is used to investigate and prosecute the offense, ask for
assistance from local law enforcement and prosecutor’s offices in obtaining equipment and supplies
used specifically for forensic evidence collection.
142 Funding under the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program and the Grants to Indian Tribal Governments Program
may be used to cover costs of some equipment. For more information, see http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov.
69704. Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit
Recommendations at a glance when developing/customizing kits:
• Use kits that meet or exceed minimum guidelines for contents.
• Work to standardize sexual assault evidence collection kits within a jurisdiction and across a state or
territory, or for federal cases.
Use kits that meet or exceed minimum guidelines for contents. Many jurisdictions have developed their
own sexual assault evidence collection kits (for evidence from victims) or have purchased premade kits
through commercial vendors. Kits may vary from one another in types of samples collected, collection
techniques, materials used for collection, and terms used to describe categories of evidence. Despite
variations, however, it is critical that every kit meets or exceeds the following minimum guidelines for
contents.143
• A kit container. It is suggested that this container have a label with blanks for identifying information
and documenting the chain of custody. Most items gathered during evidence collection are placed
into the container, after being dried, packaged, labeled, and sealed according to jurisdictional policy.
Bags are typically provided for more bulky items that will not fit in the container (e.g., clothing). Some
jurisdictions provide large paper bags to hold the container and additional evidence bags.
• An instruction sheet or checklist that guides examiners in collecting evidence and maintaining the
chain of custody.
• Forms that facilitate evidence collection and analysis, including patients’ authorization for collection
and release of evidence and information to the law enforcement agency; the medical forensic history;
and anatomical diagrams.
• Materials for collecting and preserving the following evidence, according to jurisdictional policy:144
• Patients’ clothing and underwear and foreign material dislodged from clothing.
• Foreign materials on patients’ bodies, including blood, dried secretions, fibers, loose hairs,
vegetation, soil/debris, fingernail scrapings and/or cuttings, matted hair cuttings, material
dislodged from mouth,145 and swabs of suspected semen, saliva, and/or areas highlighted by
alternate light sources.146
• Hair if required in the jurisdiction.147
• Vaginal/cervical swabs.
• Penile swabs.
• Anal/perianal swabs.
• Oral swabs.
• Body swabs.148
143 The following resources were helpful in developing this list: the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit, VEC100, by Sirchie Finger
Print Laboratories, the Texas Customized Sexual Assault Evidence Collect Kit by Tri-Tech, Inc., the Commonwealth of Virginia’s
Physical Evidence Recovery Kit, the state of California’s Medical Forensic Report: Adult/Adolescent Sexual Assault Examination, Less
than 72 Hours (OCJP 923)), the Ohio Department of Health’s Sexual Assault/Abuse Evidence Collection Kit (as found in their protocol),
Detailed Instructions; Connecticut’s Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit (as found in their protocol), and the American College of
Emergency Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually Assaulted or Sexually Abused Patient, 1999, pp. 101–107.
144 Some samples that historically have been collected are no longer recommended in many jurisdictions, unless the medical forensic
history and physical exam indicate otherwise (e.g., collection of a saliva sample for “secretor status”).
145 Flossing for evidence is not routinely done across jurisdictions. Any related safety risks to patients (e.g., potential increased risk of
HIV exposure if there is semen in the mouth and flossing causes gums to bleed) must be considered and flossing for evidence can
potentially expose the patent to that risk.
146 It is acknowledged that approaches to categorizing evidence vary. For example, one kit may collect external genital swabs when
gathering foreign materials, while in another kit, collection of genital swabs may be a separate category of evidence.
147 Some jurisdictions collect pubic and head hair combings, others collect only pubic combings. Some also collect pubic and/or head
hair reference samples. Materials should be included in the kit to collect and preserve hair evidence required by jurisdictional policy.
Jurisdictions should evaluate the necessity of routinely collecting hair samples based on discussions of how often such evidence is
actually useful or used in the jurisdiction.
148 Material may be present on any body surfaces from contact with blood or body fluids. The swabs available as a standard in each kit
varies by jurisdiction.
71• Known blood, saliva sample, or buccal swab for DNA analysis and comparison.
(See C.6. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures for specifics about evidence collection techniques.)
All forms included in the kit should be designed to facilitate optimal forensic evidence collection, analysis,
and examiner testimony. Extra copies of forms should be available to examiners for cases when the kit is
not used, but documentation of the medical forensic history is completed.
Materials and forms for collecting toxicology samples should be available to examiners (and to responding
law enforcement officers and emergency medical technicians, according to jurisdictional policy).
Work to standardize sexual assault evidence collection kits within a jurisdiction and across a state or
territory, or for federal cases.149 A designated agency in the jurisdiction should be responsible for oversight
of kit development and distribution.150 It should:
• Ensure that facilities that conduct sexual assault medical forensic exams are involved in kit
development and supplied with kits.151
• Work with relevant agencies (e.g., crime labs, law enforcement agencies, exam facilities and
examiner programs, advocacy programs, and prosecutors’ offices) to keep abreast of related
changes in technology, scientific advances, and cutting-edge practice.
• Review periodically (e.g., every 2 to 3 years) kit efficiency and usefulness.
• Make adjustments to the kit as necessary.
• Establish mechanisms to ensure that kits at exam facilities are kept up to date (e.g., if a new
evidence collection procedure is added, facilities need to know what additional supplies should be
readily available).
(See B.6. Evidence Integrity for handling and storage of kits.)
149 It may be useful to consider developing a standardized kit across all communities, states, and territories, and for federal cases.
Further analysis is needed to assess the benefits and disadvantages of such a kit and the feasibility of development and
implementation. Some challenges could include building consensus across communities regarding best practices and obtaining buy-in
from involved agencies.
150 It is important to consider costs to the state/territory/tribe/federal agencies and local community, and ability of local communities to
cover costs. In some states, one state agency (e.g., the crime laboratory) assumes the costs. In others, the costs are passed onto local
criminal justice agencies.
151As a backup to having kits readily available at exam sites or with examiner programs, jurisdictions may also want to discuss the
feasibility of storing a few kits at local law enforcement agencies or in law enforcement patrol cars. Before storing kits in patrol cars,
however, make sure that the temperatures the kit will be exposed to will not affect kit contents.
725. Timing Considerations for Collecting Evidence
Recommendations at a glance for health care providers and other individuals responding to sexual assault
victims to optimize evidence collection:
• Recognize the importance of gathering information for the medical forensic history, examining patients,
and documenting exam findings, separate from collecting evidence.
• Examine patients promptly to minimize loss of evidence and identify medical needs and concerns.
• Make decisions about whether to collect evidence and what to collect on a case-by-case basis, guided
by knowledge that outside time limits for obtaining evidence vary due to factors such as the location of
the evidence or type of sample collected.
• Examiners and law enforcement representatives should seek education and resources to aid them in
making well-informed decisions about evidence collection.
Recognize the importance of gathering information for the medical forensic history, examining
patients, and documenting exam findings, separate from collecting evidence. Examiners should obtain
the medical forensic history as appropriate, examine patients, and document findings when patients are
willing, whether or not evidence is gathered for the sexual assault evidence collection kit. The history and
documentation of exam findings can help in determining if and where there may be evidence to collect and in
addressing patients’ medical needs. In addition, they can be invaluable in and of themselves to an
investigation and prosecution if a report is made. It is also important to document patients’ demeanor during
the exam process using specific, concrete terms (e.g., crying, shaking) and their statements made related to
the assault because if the case is reported, this information could be admitted as evidence at trial. When
documenting patient statements, it is important to write down the exact wording of the statement.
Examine patients promptly to minimize the loss of evidence and identify medical needs and
concerns. Evidence can be lost from the body and clothing through a number of mechanisms. For example,
degradation of some seminal fluid components can occur within body orifices, semen can drain from the
vagina or wash from the mouth, sperm can lose motility, bodily fluids can get washed away, and dried
secretions and foreign materials can fall from the body and clothing.152 Prompt examination also helps to
quickly identify patients’ medical needs and concerns.
Due to the stability of DNA and sensitivity of tests, advancing DNA technologies also continue to extend time
limits. These technologies are even enabling forensic scientists to analyze stored evidence from crimes that
occurred years before.153 Such breakthroughs demonstrate the importance of collecting all possible evidence.
Make decisions about timeliness issues for evidence collection on a case-by-case basis, guided by
the knowledge that outside time limits for obtaining evidence vary due to factors such as the location
of the evidence or type of sample collected. Examiners and law enforcement representatives, in
particular, should be aware of the standard cutoff time for evidence collection in their jurisdictions, which is
typically indicated in instructions in evidence collection kits. But it is important to remember that evidence
collection beyond the cutoff point is conceivable and may be warranted in particular cases. In any case
where the utility of evidence collection is in question, encourage dialogue between law enforcement
representatives (if involved), examiners, and forensic scientists regarding potential benefits or limitations.
152 Paragraph drawn from the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p.
29.
153 When the evidence was initially collected after the assault, it was not of adequate quality to allow crime lab analysis using existing
technologies. See . T.S. Corey, A.R. Wetherton, P.J. Foncek, and D. Katz, Investigation of Time Interval for Recovery of Semen and
Spermatozoa from Female Internal Genitalia, from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the Department of Pathology and
Laboratory Medi cine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, and the Kentucky State Police Forensic Science Laboratory. See also
K. A. Mayntz-Press, L.M. Sims, A. Hall, and J. Ballantyne, “Y-STR Profiling in Extended Interval (≥ 3days) Postcoital Cervicovaginal
Samples”, Journal of Forensic Sciences, V. 53, Issue 2, pp. 342–348, March, 2008.
73Individuals responding to sexual assault victims should avoid basing decisions about whether to collect
evidence on how they think patients’ characteristics or circumstances will affect the investigation and
prosecution. For example, the fact that an adolescent may have lied to her parents about where she was
going the night of the assault should in no way influence the decision of the examiner and/or the law
enforcement representative to collect evidence.
Examiners and law enforcement representatives should seek education and resources to aid them in
making well-informed decisions about evidence collection. Examiners and law enforcement
representatives require training and resources to allow them to make informed decisions about whether to
collect evidence and what to collect in each case. They also need local policies and kit instructions that
encourage them to make informed decisions in each case, rather than applying a limiting general standard to
all.154 First responders also need instructions on collecting a urine sample if there is any suspicion of alcohol-
or drug-facilitated sexual assault and victims cannot wait to urinate until their arrival at the exam site.
154 For many communities, moving away from the 72-hour cutoff time represents a major shift in policy. Training and policies should
discourage decision making about evidence collection that is based on extraneous factors, such as reluctance of a criminal justice
agency to pay for sexual assault evidence collection in general.
746. Evidence Integrity
Recommendations at a glance to maintain evidence integrity:
• Follow jurisdictional policies for drying, packaging, labeling, and sealing evidence.
• Make sure transfer policies maximize evidence preservation.
• Make sure storage policies maximize evidence preservation.
• Document the handling, transfer, and storage of evidence.
Follow jurisdictional policies for drying,155 packaging, labeling, and sealing evidence. Examiners
should be educated regarding these policies. It is critical to air-dry wet evidence at room temperature in a
clean, sterile environment and quick manner that prevents contamination.156 A drying box or other device
may be used to facilitate the drying process. Jurisdictions should have policies for handling evidence that
cannot be dried thoroughly at the exam site (e.g., wet clothing, tampons, sanitary napkins, tissues,
diaphragms, and condoms), as well as for liquid evidence such as urine and drawn blood samples. When
packaging dry evidence, use paper containers rather than plastic, because plastic containers retain moisture
and promote degradation of biological evidence. Following proper drying and packaging procedures is vital to
prevent the growth of mold and bacteria that can destroy an evidentiary sample.
Keep in mind that evidentiary materials include exam documentation. Follow jurisdictional policies for
documenting exam findings and the medical forensic history and for packaging, labeling, and sealing such
documentation. Properly recording and preserving this information is critical for its admissibility during a trial.
Make sure transfer policies maximize evidence preservation. Minimize transit time between collection of
evidence and storage of kits. To avoid potential degradation of evidence, it is important to transport kits
containing liquid samples and other wet evidence in a timely fashion. Only a law enforcement official or duly
authorized agent should transfer evidence from the exam site to the appropriate crime laboratory or other
designated storage site (e.g., a law enforcement property facility). Jurisdictional procedures for evidence
management and distribution must be in place and followed. Those involved in evidence management and
distribution should be educated on the specifics of these procedures and their responsibilities.
Make sure storage policies maximize evidence preservation. Secure storage sites should be designated
and storage requirements should be consistent across a jurisdiction. Storage requirements depend on what
types of specimens are being collected and on jurisdictional policy. For example, kits without drawn blood or
other wet evidence generally do not need to be refrigerated. Follow jurisdictional policy for refrigeration of
drawn blood samples and other wet evidence. The use of dried blood samples on blood collection cards is
encouraged because they do not require refrigerated storage.157 Urine should be refrigerated or frozen when
stored.158 Those involved in storing biological evidence should be knowledgeable regarding optimal storage
conditions as well as the hazards for handling and storing evidence such as blood and urine. Evidence
should be retained for as long as possible, as storage space permits. Some jurisdictions require storage of
evidence for the full statute of limitations of the offense.
Make sure jurisdictional policies are in place to address evidence storage in cases where patients are
undecided about reporting. Finding adequate storage space for these kits is a challenge for many facilities
and agencies (e.g., community-based or hospital examiner programs may lack the capacity for secure long-
term storage of kits at their facilities). Local responders, particularly examiners, law enforcement
representatives, and crime lab staff, should discuss and address these and related challenges and develop
155 Dry evidence unless indicated otherwise (e.g., freezing).
156 With the ever-increasing sensitivity of DNA analysis, there is a greater chance that accidental contamination and dilution by foreign
DNA can be detected. Every precaution should be taken to reduce outside contamination and dilution of evidence.
157 The National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting a 10-year project on DNA storage. Thus far, it confirms that
refrigeration of dried DNA is generally unnecessary.
158 Liquid blood and urine are generally required for toxicology purposes. These samples require refrigeration, preferably in a locked
refrigerator. If a locked refrigerator is not immediately available, these samples can be kept at room temperature for no longer than 24
hours.
75procedures that allow for the secure storage of these kits without revealing patients’ identity. Storing the
evidence as long as necessary is the ideal (e.g., until the patient decides whether to report or until the
jurisdiction’s statute of limitations for retaining evidence expires). However, due to lack of storage space, kits
in some jurisdictions are stored for a limited period of time (e.g., 1, 5, or 10 years) and then destroyed if no
report is made. Many jurisdictions have elected to store kits for the duration of the statute of limitations for
the offense. If a limited-time policy is implemented, it is important that patients are informed regarding the
amount of time they have to decide to report and procedures for reporting. It is also critical that the period of
time given to patients to decide allows them the chance to consider their decision thoroughly; a short time
such as a week or a month may not be sufficient to make such a decision.
Document the handling, transfer, and storage of evidence. Examiners must maintain control of evidence
during the exam, while evidence is being dried, and until it is in the kit container and sealed (and then follow
jurisdictional procedures for storing evidence securely or handing it over to a duly authorized agent for
transfer to a storage site). Documentation should continue with each transfer of the evidence to law
enforcement, the crime laboratory, and others involved in the investigative process.159 Patients, advocates,
family members, and other support persons should not handle the evidence. Documentation of the chain-of-
custody information is vital to ensuring that there has been no loss or alteration of evidence prior to trial.
Educate all those involved in handling, transferring, and storing evidence regarding the specifics of
maintaining the chain of custody. If the patient is transferred between facilities, staff at both facilities should
be careful to complete this documentation.

77781. Initial Contact
Recommendations at a glance to facilitate initial contact with victims:
• Build consensus among involved agencies regarding procedures for coordinated initial response when a
recent sexual assault is disclosed or reported. Educate responders to follow procedures.
• Recognize essential elements of initial response.
Build consensus among involved agencies regarding procedures for coordinated initial response
when a recent sexual assault is disclosed or reported. Educate responders to follow procedures.
First responders from these agencies (e.g., 911 dispatchers, law enforcement representatives, emergency
medical services (EMS) technicians, hospital emergency department staff, sexual assault examiners, and
advocates) need to be educated about and follow these procedures. Responders also need discipline-
specific procedures (e.g., EMS procedures should stress the importance of preserving evidence when caring
for acute injuries and treating victims with sensitivity).
In addition, other community professionals to whom victims may disclose need to know procedures for
activating the SART/SARRT or obtaining immediate assistance for victims if a SART/SARRT does not exist.
(For information on this topic, see A.1. Coordinated Team Approach and Appendix B. Creation of
SART/SARRTs.) Also, recognize that some institutions and residential living programs have internal
procedures for handling sexual assault disclosures. SART/SARRT members should work with these entities
to ensure that their procedures address the needs of victims and are coordinated with jurisdictional
multidisciplinary response.
Recognize essential elements of initial response. Some victims may initially present at an exam site. But
most victims who receive immediate medical care for sexual assault initially contact 911, law enforcement, or
an advocacy agency for help.
Law enforcement, 911, and EMS response. Steps that should be taken during initial law enforcement, 911,
or EMS contact include:
• Assess victims’ needs for immediate care for potentially life-threatening or serious injuries.
Administer necessary first aid and request/obtain emergency medical assistance according to
jurisdictional policy.
• Address safety needs of victims and others at the scene (e.g., offenders may be present), calling for
assistance/backup if needed.
• Assess quickly the age, abilities, communication modality, and health condition of victims and tailor
your response as appropriate (e.g., a qualified interpreter, assistive devices, or protective service
worker may be needed).
• Respond to requests for victim assistance as quickly as possible.160 Understand that victims need
immediate assistance for many reasons: they may not be safe, may be physically injured, and/or are
experiencing trauma. Be aware that time delays in response can cause loss of evidence and
increased trauma.
• If injuries do not appear serious, emphasize to victims the need for medical evaluation and address
related health concerns. Also, explain the purpose of the exam and what happens during the exam
process, keeping in mind that the amount of information that victims want at this time varies.
160 In some areas, law enforcement representatives may not respond promptly because they must travel considerable distances and
through rough terrain to get to victims’ locations. Some law enforcement agencies may not have enough representatives to respond to
each case in a timely manner (e.g., a rural sheriff’s office may only have one officer). In communities with such limitations, it is important
that agencies and professionals involved in these cases advocate for increasing the capacity of law enforcement agencies to respond
promptly. They also can work jointly to ensure that there is at least one responder/agency from which victims can consistently receive
initial help (e.g., EMS or the advocacy program). That professional/agency should be trained in initial response and be able to access
emergency medical assistance if needed and coordinate transportation to the exam facility. Information about which agency/responder
to call for help must be publicized in the community.
79• Inform victims about exam facility options (if options exist) and seek their consent to transport them
to the facility of their choice (if they had options) for treatment and/or medical/forensic evaluation.161
• Encourage victims’ interaction with advocates as soon as possible after disclosure of the assault,
even if victims choose not to receive medical care and/or have the medical forensic exam. In a few
jurisdictions, advocates may be dispatched directly to the scene to provide victim support and
advocacy, if appropriate. Follow local procedures for activating an advocate.
• Ask victims if they would like family members or friends to be contacted.
• Explain options for interpretation and translation for victims who are not proficient in English or who
may prefer to communicate in a non-English language.
• Take measures to preserve crime scene evidence, including evidence on the body and clothing of
victims. Document victims’ demeanor and statements related to the assault, according to
jurisdictional policy.
• Explain to victims their reporting options. Keep in mind that the amount of information desired will
vary per individual.
• Responding law enforcement officials should seek basic information from victims about the assault in
order to apprehend suspects and facilitate crime scene preservation in a timely manner.
If victims agree to seek emergency care and/or have evidence collected:
• Explain to victims in a language they understand how to preserve bodily evidence until it can be
collected (e.g., do not wash, change clothes, urinate, defecate, smoke, drink, eat, brush hair or teeth,
or rinse mouth).
• Explain to victims in a language they understand that clothing most likely will be taken as evidence.
They may wish to bring or have someone bring a clean change of clothes to the exam facility. If
applicable, let victims know that replacement clothing will be available at the exam site. If they
changed clothes since the assault, the clothing worn during and immediately after the assault will be
needed. Follow law enforcement procedures for retrieving clothing or other items from a crime scene
so that evidence is not inadvertently destroyed or contaminated.
• In suspected cases of alcohol- or drug-facilitated assault, victims’ first available urine sample should
be sought if they cannot wait to urinate until arrival at the exam site. (For information on procedures,
see C.7. Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault.) Victims might have been drugged without their
knowledge. If they or their families, friends, or responders suspect alcohol- or drug-facilitated assault,
a urine sample should be sought.
• Transport or arrange transportation for victims to the exam site that has the most appropriate
forensic medical examination capability.162 Victims with disabilities may have equipment (e.g.,
wheelchairs and other assistive devices) and/or service animals that also need to be transported.163
Keep in mind that victims may consider such equipment as extensions of themselves, so any such
equipment should be treated with care.
• Follow jurisdictional policy on alerting exam facilities about the pending arrival of patients.
• Do not take suspects to the same exam facility as victims at the same time, if possible.
Advocate response. If victims have initial contact with advocates, this contact typically occurs through a
phone hotline call or a face-to-face meeting. Advocates should follow agency-specific and jurisdictional policy
for first response. For example, advocates should assess victims’ safety and need for medical assistance
and call 911 in cases of serious injuries or when there is an imminent threat to someone. Advocates should
describe potential medical concerns related to sexual assault, support victims in seeking care for possible
injuries, provide information about their options (e.g., health care, advocacy and counseling, interpretation
and translation, evidence collection, exam site options, and reporting to law enforcement), and offer referrals.
161 Inform victims of the approximate amount of time it will take to travel to the facility and how long they will be at the exam site. This
information can help them prepare for what to expect and make needed arrangements (e.g., childcare, getting time off from work or
school, or informing family members). In some areas, it may take considerable time to get to the exam site (i.e., several hours). Involved
agencies in these areas may want to consider the feasibility of having a specially trained examiner located in their community.
162 Many jurisdictions have designated exam sites. For more information on this topic, see B.2. Facilities.
163 In addition, evidence may be found on assistive devices and/or service animals.
80They can explain to victims how to preserve bodily evidence for evidence collection and the importance of
prompt toxicology testing if alcohol- or drug-facilitated assault is suspected. In general, advocates can help
victims identify and consider how to address their needs and concerns, as well as
identify individuals who might support them in dealing with the aftermath of the assault. They can activate the
SART/SARRT (if one exists) with victims’ permission. Alternately, advocates can offer to help victims arrange
transportation to the exam site, obtain nonemergency medical care, and obtain assistance from law
enforcement. They can also accompany them through medical forensic procedures.
Regardless of which agencies are first responders, responders should always be sensitive to the victim’s
needs and level of trauma. It is common for victims of sexual violence to have showered, eaten or taken
other self-protective actions that may have destroyed evidence prior to engaging any service providers.
Responders should react in an understanding and non-judgmental manner to ensure they receive
appropriate care.
81822. Triage and Intake
Recommendations at a glance for health care providers to facilitate a triage and intake process that
addresses patients’ needs:
• Consider sexual assault patients a priority.
• Perform a prompt, competent medical assessment. Then respond to acute injury, the need for trauma
care, and safety needs of patients before collecting evidence.
• Alert examiners of the need for their services.
• Contact victim advocates so they can offer services to patients, if not already done.
• Assess and respond to safety concerns of victims upon arrival at the exam site, such as threats to
patients or staff.
• Assess patients’ needs for immediate medical or mental health intervention prior to the evidentiary exam,
following facility policy.
Consider sexual assault patients a priority.164 (For a discussion of this topic, see A.2. Victim-Centered
Care.)
Utilize a private location within the exam facility for patient intakes, as well as for a waiting area for patients’
family members and friends and law enforcement interviews. (Also see A.2.Victim-Centered Care.)
Perform a prompt, competent medical assessment. Then respond to acute injury, the need for trauma
care, and safety needs of patients before collecting evidence. In addition to promoting physical health,
sensitive and timely medical care can help reduce the likelihood of acute psychological trauma and its
aftereffects, support patients’ existing and emerging coping skills, and set the tone for patients’ resumption of
normal functioning.
Acute medical needs take precedence over evidentiary needs. Patients should be instructed to not wash,
change clothes, urinate, defecate, smoke, drink, or eat until initially evaluated by examiners, unless
necessary for treating acute medical injuries. If alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault is suspected, and
patients need to urinate prior to the arrival of examiners, ensure that the urine sample is collected properly
while maintaining the chain of custody.
The forensic examiner should be involved in all aspects of the medical forensic examination of the sexual
assault patient. As soon as possible after the initial triage, management, and stabilization of acute medical
problems and before treating non-acute injuries, the evidentiary exam can be conducted (with patients’
permission). In circumstances in which patients are seriously injured or impaired, examiners must be
prepared to work alongside other health care providers who are stabilizing and treating them. In such cases,
examiners may need to perform exams in settings such as a health care facility’s emergency department, an
operating room, a recovery room, or an intensive care unit.
Alert examiners of the need for their services. The SART/SARRT, if one exists, can work with exam
facilities to identify acceptable timeframes to conduct a medical forensic exam after a patient’s arrival and
medical evaluation, management, and stabilization. If examiners are not based at the site or need to be
dispatched, the facility should contact them immediately after identifying a sexual assault patient.165
164 Historically, sexual assault patients who came to a health care facility (namely hospital emergency departments) for medical care and
forensic evidence collection had to wait a long time to be examined. Often, they were not considered priority cases because they lacked
visible physical injuries or their physical injuries were less serious than others coming into the facility. The psychological trauma they
were experiencing often was not taken into account, nor was the fact that evidence can be destroyed or contaminated if collection is
delayed. Many communities are addressing this problem by establishing examiner programs. At busy health care facilities that make life
or death decisions about prioritizing patients, these programs can help ensure that sexual assault patients are offered and receive a
medical forensic examination promptly.
165 It is possible that examiners could also be dispatched by first responders at the crime scene or by health care staff after being alerted
that a sexual assault patient will be arriving at their facility. Although activating examiners as early as possible seems like it would
benefit these patients, such a procedure can potentially cause confusion. For example, after activating an examiner to go to a particular
83Examiners are often required to arrive at the exam site within a certain period of time (e.g., 30 minutes) after
being dispatched.
Contact victim advocates so they can offer services to patients, if not already done. (For a discussion
of this topic, see A.2.Victim-Centered Care.)
Assess and respond to safety concerns of victims upon arrival at the exam site, such as threats to
patients or staff. The facility should have procedures to assess such safety concerns at the exam site and
to respond to such threats or dangerous situations. (For a discussion of this topic, see A.2. Victim-Centered
Care.) Communicating any information may require a qualified interpreter166 for victims who are LEP.167
Assess patients’ needs for immediate medical or mental health intervention prior to the evidentiary
exam, following facility policy. Seek informed consent of patients before providing treatment. (For more
information on this topic, see A.3. Informed Consent.) Also, inform them that they have a right to receive
medical care regardless of whether the assault is reported to law enforcement. (For more information on this
topic, see A.5. Reporting to Law Enforcement.)
exam facility, there may be significant delays in getting the patient to the site or changes en route to the facility. Sexually assaulted
individuals may also change their minds about care or evidence collection.
166 There is currently no certification process for health care interpreters or translators. For more information about qualifications
including standards of practice for health care interpreters and translators, please see What’s in a Word: A Guide to Understanding
Interpreting and Translation in Health Care, National Health Law Program (2010).
167 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations require that entities that receive federal financial assistance
provide meaningful access to their programs, services, and activities for persons with limited English proficiency.
843. Documentation by Health Care Personnel
Recommendations at a glance for completing needed documentation:
• Ensure completion of all appropriate documentation.
• Educate examiners on proper documentation.
• Ensure the accuracy and objectivity of medical forensic reports.
Ensure completion of all appropriate documentation. Examiners are responsible for documenting the
details of the medical forensic exam and treatment provided in the medical record, as well as documenting
required data for the evidence collection kit, according to jurisdictional policy. This evidence collection kit
report usually includes patient consent forms related to evidence, the history of the assault, and information
pertaining to evidence collection that will assist the crime lab in material identification for analysis.168 (The
medical forensic history and documentation of exam findings are discussed in more depth in later chapters in
this section.) The only medical issues documented in this report are findings that potentially relate to the
assault or preexisting medical factors that could influence interpretation of findings. If the case is reported,
the criminal justice system will use the entire medical forensic record of the sexual assault visit, along with
collected evidence, photographs and video images, and victim/witness statements, as a basis for
investigation and possible prosecution. If examiners are required to testify in court, they will use the report to
recall the incident.
The overall medical forensic record kept by examiners and other clinicians follows a standard approach of
addressing acute complaints; gathering pertinent historical data; describing physical findings, laboratory and
x-ray findings, consultation reports (if done) and evidence collection procedures; and documenting treatment
(and response to treatment) and follow-up care. The complete medical forensic record of the sexual assault
visit should be maintained separately from the patient’s medical record to limit disclosure of unrelated
information and to preserve confidentiality. The medical record is stored at the exam site. The exam site
should have clear policies about who is allowed access to these records.169
The medical record is not part of the evidence collection kit and it should not be submitted to the crime lab or
given to law enforcement. Much of the record is not relevant to case prosecution, and releasing it infringes
upon patients’ privacy rights. Although all or part of the medical record may be subpoenaed, if patients do not
consent to its release, it is ultimately up to the court to decide whether such information is pertinent to the
case and should be released.
Educate examiners on proper documentation. It is vital that the exam documentation be thorough,
precise, and accurate. It is essential that examiners receive education on the importance of proper
documentation and on writing reports that are relevant to their role. As previously discussed, forensic
documentation must include diagrammatic rendering, written description (including assessment for
tenderness and induration), and forensic imaging of any visible finding (traumatic or evidence).
Law enforcement representatives and advocates who are involved in the response should understand the
importance of examiner documentation and be able to convey that importance to patients.
Ensure the accuracy and objectivity of medical forensic reports. It is suggested that examiners within
an exam site, jurisdiction, or region devise an appropriate review process tailored to their needs. Consider
having a clinical director or supervisor at the exam site systematically review documentation related to the
exam. (In some jurisdictions, review of nonphysician examiner’s documentation by a medical
director/supervisor is required.) These reviews can serve to increase the overall effectiveness of the
examiner program by ensuring that reports are completed according to policy, assessing staff training needs,
168 Documentation of exam findings should include patients’ demeanor and statements related to the assault not already recorded on
the medical forensic history. Such documentation can be admitted as evidence at trial in most states. Local prosecutors can provide
more detailed information on this type of documentation.
169 Mechanisms to restrict access to records related to the exam are particularly important in small communities where exam site
employees may be acquaintances, friends, and family members of patients or suspects.
85considering adjustments needed to paperwork, troubleshooting for potential problems, and identifying trends
in presenting the issues of patients. All identifying patient information should be removed when a document
is copied for a review. The clinical director or supervisor can also be involved in broader multidisciplinary
quality assurance efforts related to the exam process.
864. The Medical Forensic History
Recommendations at a glance for health care providers to facilitate gathering information from patients:
• Coordinate medical forensic history taking and investigative interviewing.
• Advocates should be able to provide support and advocacy during the history, if desired by patients.
• Consider patients’ needs prior to and during information gathering.
• Obtain the medical forensic history.
Coordinate medical forensic history taking and investigative interviewing. Examiners typically ask
patients to provide a medical forensic history after initial medical care for acute problems and before the
examination and evidence collection. This history, obtained by asking patients detailed forensic and medical
questions related to the assault, is intended to guide the exam, evidence collection, and crime lab analysis of
findings. In cases where the victim reports the assault, law enforcement representatives should also collect
information from patients to help in the apprehension of suspects and in case investigation.170
Gathering information from patients often takes place soon after they have experienced the assault. Not only
can discussing the assault cause patients to feel re-violated, but their emotional and physical condition may
make communication difficult. They may also be uncomfortable discussing personal matters with involved
responders. Those seeking information about the assault should work collaboratively to create an
information-gathering process that is as respectful to patients as possible and minimizes repetition of
questions.171 However, jurisdictions should consider the implications of the evolving law on hearsay
exceptions when determining the level and nature of coordination. See Appendix C for more information on
the relevant case law and how it relates to medical forensic examinations.
Promote a streamlined, victim-centered information-gathering process. Jurisdictions employ several
methods, including the following:
• Communication and coordination among responding officers, examiners, investigators, and
prosecutors as they go about their separate information-gathering processes.
• Examiners and investigators together ask patients basic questions in a language that she or he
understands. One asks questions while the others listen. They then speak to patients separately to
gather any remaining information required.
• The medical forensic history and investigative interviews are conducted simultaneously to the extent
feasible. The SART/SARRT should determine the information-gathering process, reflecting the best
use of resources and needs and consent of patients. The team may agree that a particular person or
agency will be the primary interviewer.172
Whatever the method selected, jurisdictions should carefully plan how they will coordinate the logistics of
medical forensic history taking and investigative interviewing.
Advocates should be able to provide support and advocacy during the history if desired by patients.
The presence of an advocate may help patients feel more comfortable answering questions. Advocates may
also assist patients in voicing their concerns about questions being asked and clarifying their needs during
this time. Advocates should be careful not to answer questions asked of patients or otherwise influence their
statements.
170 The website of the Violence Against Women Online Resources offers several resources on law enforcement investigation of sexual
assault crimes. See http://www.vaw.umn.edu/categories/2,8.
171 Some repetition of questions is likely to occur during the exam process.
172 Caution should be exercised if combining medical forensic history taking with investigative interviewing. At the time of such
information gathering, patients may not want to speak with law enforcement or be ready to go into the extensive details needed for
investigative purposes. Patients may withhold information from law enforcement representatives or not want to talk with them about
certain issues (e.g., their menstrual cycle or types of penetration). They might feel more comfortable talking to examiners in private
about these topics. There is also a concern about questioners asking questions outside of their realm of responsibility.
87Presence of family members, friends, and other personal support persons. Prior to taking the history,
patients should be informed that the presence of personal support persons (other than advocates) may
influence or be perceived as influencing their statements.173 These individuals could be subpoenaed as
witnesses in their case.174 If, after receiving this information, patients choose to have personal support
persons present during the history, these individuals should be advised not to actively participate in the
process. For example, they should not answer questions for patients, comment on patients’ answers,
interrupt patients, or make facial expressions in response to patients’ answers.175
Consider patients’ needs prior to and during information gathering. Pressing issues (e.g., for treatment
of serious injuries, crisis intervention and support, translation and interpretation, and childcare during the
exam process) should be addressed before commencing with information gathering. Be mindful of patients’
capacity to answer questions during a lengthy information-gathering process, and take breaks as needed.
The facility should have procedures in place and examiners should be educated to accommodate patients’
communication skill level and preferred mode of communicating. This is particularly important for patients
with communication-related disabilities and limited English proficient patients. If interpreters are necessary,
they should be present prior to questioning and there should be space for them in the exam room and other
rooms where information is gathered. Patients with communication-related disabilities may wish to use
wordboards, speech synthesizers, or other assistive communication devices to help them communicate. The
use of cards with pictures (e.g., of medical procedures and human anatomy) may facilitate communication
with patients with some types of cognitive disabilities or limited vocabularies. 176
It is important that examiners are aware of and responsive to verbal and nonverbal cues from patients. For
example, patients may react negatively as they recall experiences during the assault or are reminded of
previous violence committed upon them. (It is important to document this information.) What they may need
most at this point is a break, the understanding of examiners, and opportunities to talk about what they are
experiencing. Advocates can be particularly helpful to patients who are dealing with these emotions.
Use a private and quiet setting for information gathering. Ideally, there should be no interruptions and no time
constraints for questioners or for use of the room where the information is being gathered. Although some
facilities may lack space, an effort should be made to secure a private and quiet setting for this purpose. In
many jurisdictions, history-taking takes place in the exam room prior to the exam.
Obtain the medical forensic history. The specific questions asked of patients by examiners for the medical
forensic history vary from one jurisdiction to the next, as do forms used to record the history.177 However, the
following information should be sought routinely from patients:178
1. Date and time of the sexual assault(s): It is essential to know the period of time that has elapsed
between the assault and the physical examination/collection of evidence as well as documentation of
173 Ideally, these individuals should not be present when giving patients this information or when patients make the decision whether
they want the support person present.
174 They should also be informed that the presence of these individuals during the medical forensic history could potentially reduce the
degree of confidentiality advocates can offer patients (e.g., they may be called on to provide testimony regarding the interactions
between patients and family members or friends present during this time). Also, in jurisdictions that have physician/patient privilege, but
not a victim advocate privilege, the advocate could be required to testify. Victims should be informed of this before disclosing non-
medically relevant information.
175 Requests to have family, friends, and other personal support persons present during the medical forensic history should be allowed
unless it is considered potentially harmful to the exam process by the SART/involved responders. For example, in cases involving
adolescents, parents or guardians should not be allowed in the exam room if they are suspected of committing the assault or of being
abusive to patients.

Paragraph partially drawn from N. Baladerian, Skills for Interviewing Adult Abuse Victims Who Have Developmental Disabilities, p. 1.
177 In some jurisdictions, examiners ask for investigative details during history taking. In others, examiners only ask for information
related to treatment and collecting/interpreting physical and lab findings. One concern is that investigative details reported by examiners
that differ from the law enforcement report may be used to undermine the credibility of patients. Patients should be told that if they are
too uncomfortable or embarrassed to talk about something, they should say so rather than saying something that contradicts information
that may be in the law enforcement report. (Drawn from L. Ledray, SANE Development and Operation Guide, 1998, p. 77.) Another
concern is that asking investigative questions is outside the examiner’s role.

88injuries. Evidence collection may be influenced by the time interval since the assault as well as the
interpretation of both the physical exam and evidence analysis.
2. Pertinent patient medical history: The interpretation of physical findings may be affected by medical data
related to menstruation, recent anal-genital injuries, surgeries, or diagnostic procedures, blood-clotting
history, and other pertinent medical conditions or treatment.
3. Recent consensual sexual activity: The sensitivity of DNA analysis makes it important to gather
information about recent consensual intercourse, whether it was anal, vaginal, and/or oral, and whether a
condom was used. A trace amount of semen or other bodily fluid, as well as genital microtrauma, may be
identified that is not associated with the crime. Once identified, it may need to be associated with a
consensual partner, and then used for elimination purposes to aid in interpreting evidence.179
4. Post-assault activities of patients: The quantity and quality of evidence is affected both by actions taken
by patients and the passage of time. It is critical to know what, if any, activities were performed prior to
the examination (e.g., have patients urinated, defecated, had consensual sexual intercourse, wiped
genitals or the body, douched, removed/inserted a tampon/sanitary pad/diaphragm, used oral
rinse/gargled, washed, brushed teeth, eaten or drank, smoked, used drugs, or changed clothing?).
5. Assault-related patient history: Information such as the location of nongenital injury, tenderness, pain
and/or bleeding, and anal-genital injury, pain, and/or bleeding can direct evidence collection and medical
care. Patients should also be questioned about strangulation since this type of injury can result in airway
obstruction if swelling occurs and strangulation is a very common occurrence in sexual assault cases.
6. Suspect information (if known): Forensic scientists seek evidentiary items that may have had cross-
contact or transfer among patients, suspects, and crime scenes. The gender and number of suspects
may offer guidance to types and amounts of foreign materials that might be found on patients’ bodies
and clothing. Suspect information gathered during this history should be limited to that which will guide
the exam and forensic evidence collection. Detailed questions about suspects are asked during the
investigative interview.
7. Nature of the physical assault(s): Information about the physical surroundings of the assault(s) (e.g.,
indoors, outdoors, car, alley, room, rug, dirt, mud, or grass) and tactics employed by suspects is crucial
to the detection, collection, and analysis of physical evidence. Tactics may include, but are not limited to,
use of weapons (threatened and/or injuries inflicted), physical blows, grabbing, holding, pinching, biting,
using physical restraints, strangulation, burns (thermal and/or chemical), threat(s) of harm, and
involuntary ingestion of alcohol/drugs. Knowing whether suspects may have been injured during the
assault may be useful when recovering evidence from patients (e.g., blood) or from suspects (e.g.,
bruising, fingernail marks, or bite marks).
8. Detection of alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault: It is critical in these cases to collect information
such as whether there was memory loss, lapse of consciousness, or vomiting; whether the patient was
given food or drink by the suspect (if the patient knows); or whether the patient voluntarily ingested drugs
or alcohol. Collecting toxicology samples within 120 hours of the suspected ingestion is recommended if
there was either loss of memory or lapse of consciousness, according to jurisdictional policy.
9. Description of the sexual assault(s): An accurate but brief description is crucial to detecting, collecting,
and analyzing physical evidence. The description should include any:180
• Penetration of genitalia (e.g., vulva, hymen, and/or vagina of female patient), however slight,
including what was used for penetration (e.g., finger, penis, or other object);
• Penetration of the anal opening, however slight;
• Oral contact with genitals (of patients by suspects or of suspects by patients);
• Other contact with genitals (of patients by suspects or of suspects by patients);
• Oral contact with the anus (of patients by suspects or of suspects by patients);
• Nongenital act(s) (e.g., licking, kissing, suction injury, strangulation, and biting);
• Other act(s) including use of objects;
• If known, whether ejaculation occurred and location(s) of ejaculation (e.g., mouth, vagina, genitals,
anus/rectum, body surface, on clothing, on bedding, or other); and
179 Patients should be aware that there might be a need at a later time to obtain an elimination sample from consensual partners.
Jurisdictions may have policies in place for seeking such samples within a certain timeframe following the exam.
180 Specific questions asked will depend on case facts (e.g., the gender of the patient and the gender of the suspect).
89• Use of contraception or lubricants.181
These questions require specific and sometimes detailed answers. Some may be especially difficult for
patients to answer. Examiners should explain that these questions are asked during every sexual assault
medical forensic exam. They should also explain why each question is being asked.
181 Certain contraceptive preparations can interfere with accurate interpretation of preliminary chemical tests frequently used in the
analysis of potential seminal stains. In addition, contraceptive foams, creams, or sponges can destroy sperm. Lubricants of any kind are
trace evidence and may be compared with potential sources left at the crime scene or recovered from bodies of suspects. Knowing
whether a condom was used also may be useful in explaining the absence of semen.
905. Photography
Recommendations at a glance to photograph evidence on patients:
• Consider the extent of forensic photography necessary.
• Consider the equipment.
• Be considerate of patient comfort and privacy.
• Explain forensic photography procedures to patients.
• Take initial and follow-up photographs as appropriate, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Consider policies on storage, transfer, and retention of photographs.
Consider the extent of forensic photography necessary. Taking photographs of patients’ anatomy that
was involved in the assault should be part of the medical forensic examination process in sexual assault
cases. Such photographs can supplement the medical forensic history, evidence documentation, and
physical findings.182 As to the extent of photographs necessary, communities appear to take two different
approaches. Some routinely take photographs, with patients’ permission, of both detected injuries and
normal (apparently uninjured) anatomy involved in the assault. These jurisdictions encourage examiners to
collect and document all evidence and leave the determination about the value of the evidence to litigants.
Other communities limit photographs to detected injuries. However, photographs should not be used to
interpret subtle and/or nonspecific findings (e.g., erythema or redness) that are not noted on exam
documentation. Review of photographs cannot reliably diagnose injuries not seen by examiners.
Involved prosecutors, law enforcement officials, examiners, and advocates should further discuss the extent
of photography they view as critical, examine any related case law, consider their concerns on this issue and
how to be sensitive to victims, and, ultimately, determine what strategy is right for their community.
Consider the equipment. Examiners should take these photographs, due to the highly personal nature of
the photography involved. Examiners are responsible for forensic photography during the exam because
patients are often more comfortable and less traumatized when they take photographs.183 Any photographs
taken by nonmedical personnel should include only the head and extremities and should not document
findings on the torso or genital region.
Examiners should be familiar with equipment operation and be educated on forensic photography in sexual
assault cases. Photographic equipment should be used that can clearly document the level of injury. Consult
with local criminal justice agencies regarding the types of equipment that should be used (e.g., prosecutors
can assess which types of equipment produce results that are acceptable to the court).184 Also consult with
local examiners, because they are often knowledgeable regarding photographic and video equipment used
in these cases and their effectiveness in capturing images during the exam.
Be considerate of patient comfort and privacy. Minimize patients’ discomfort while they are being
photographed and respect their need for modesty and privacy. Drape them appropriately while taking
photographs.185
Also, consider how to best provide support to patients during this time. Patients may want an advocate
and/or a personal support person to be present. Take measures to avoid allegations of impropriety when
photographing patients. For instance, if for some reason a male examiner is photographing a female patient,
another woman should be present at this time.

183 Avoid requiring that patients go to another site (e.g., the law enforcement agency) to have initial photographs taken.
184 For a discussion of the admissibility of digital photographs, please see D. Nagosky, The Admissibility of Digital Photographs in
Criminal Cases, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, December, 2005.
185 Drawn from the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p. 56, and the
American College of Emergency Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually Assaulted or Sexually Abused Patient, 1999,
p. 113.
91Explain forensic photography procedures to patients. Taking photographs of patients in the aftermath of
an assault can be retraumatizing. To help reduce the chances of retraumatization, examiners can help
patients understand the purpose of photography in forensic evidence collection, the extent to which
photographs will be taken and procedures that will be used, potential uses of photographs during
investigation and prosecution (especially anogenital images if taken), and the possible need to obtain
additional photographs following the exam. (Also see A.3. Informed Consent.)
Take initial and follow-up photographs as appropriate, according to jurisdictional policy.186 Strive to
control every element in the photograph to produce a clear, powerful statement. Photographs should be
taken prior to evidence collection.
Patient identification. Link patients’ identity and the date to the photographs, according to jurisdictional
policy.187 For example, print the patient’s name, date of exam, and the examiner’s name/initials on a plain
sheet of paper, or using a patient label. Photograph this sheet at the beginning and end of the roll of film for
identification. Some jurisdictions also photograph the face of patients for identification purposes. Some
cameras offer the option of imprinting the date and/or time on the negative, and some have the ability to
enter a case number so the face or name of a patient is not on the film. Digital imaging can automatically
embed the date/time and a variety of other technical data in each image. This information can be accessed
when the image is downloaded onto the computer.
Mechanisms should be in place (e.g., at law enforcement agencies and exam facilities) to protect patients’
privacy and confidentiality related to the photographs.
Clear and accurate photographs. Use the shutter speed and lens aperture to control exposure (automated
cameras and flash units can give incorrect exposures). Use adequate lighting whether the source is natural,
flood, or flash. Use of flashes and lighting in the exam room can change the color of evidence; a filter may
help adjust lighting so that the photograph is truer to color (noting in records any alterations to the
environment to enhance photographs). Include a color bar in the photograph to ensure accurate color
reproduction.
Strive for undistorted photographs with good perspective (whenever possible, use a normal focal length lens,
and keep the plane of the film or digital sensor parallel to the plane of the object to be documented. Maintain
sharp focus (keep the camera steady, focus carefully, use maximum depth of field, and look at the frame of
the scene).
A good-quality macro lens with a ring strobe flash offers the best quality and most flexibility for forensic
photography involving sexual assault.
Scale. Use a forensic scale or ruler for size reference in photographs. In addition to those photographs that
identify patients and anatomical locations being photographed, take at least two photographs of each area—
one with and one without scale. Taking two photographs in this manner demonstrates that the scale was not
concealing anything important. Photograph evidence in place before moving it or collecting it. Do not alter or
move evidence when photographing, and make every effort to minimize background distraction in
photographs while maintaining the focus of areas being photographed.
Orientation of shots. Take at least two shots at three orientations:
1. Take medium-range photographs of each separate injury, including cuts, bruises, swelling, lacerations,
and abrasions. Work from one side to the other and then top to bottom, or design a workable method. Be
consistent. Take “regional” shots to show injuries in the context and orientation of a body region; these
photographs should include easily identifiable anatomical landmarks.
2. Take closeup images of particular injuries, using the scale. When photographing a wound, show its
relationship to another part of the body. Take at least three photographs involving a wound area. Shield

Sexually Abused Patient, 1999, pp. 113–115.

92uninvolved breast or genital areas when possible; highly graphic photos may be deemed inadmissible in
court and make the case less credible. All injuries should be recorded with a closeup view using a macro
lens or setting. Try to capture subtleties in texture and color. Document pattern injuries caused by an
object. Do not use a flash function around an injured eye as it can cause retinal damage.
3. In some cases, a full body photograph may be appropriate to show scope of injury or state of clothing.
However, such photos should be taken ensuring as much modesty and privacy as possible, through
draping and other techniques. Photos taken solely for the purpose of identification should be done with
patients fully clothed or in a gown.
Photographing skin. Closeup photographs of hands and fingernails may show traces of blood, skin, or hair.
Be sure to look for damage to nails or missing nails. Photograph marks of restraint or bondage around wrists,
ankles, or neck; they may be compared later with the object in question that made the marks. Photograph
transfer evidence present on the body or clothing, such as dirt, gravel, or vegetation.
Bite mark evidence. Photograph bite marks, according to jurisdictional policy.188
Accountability. All photographs should be clearly labeled and the chain of custody maintained. Follow
jurisdictional policy for development of film, transfer, duplication or additional prints, and storage of
photographs. Do not include photographs in the evidence collection kit sent to the crime lab.
Follow-up photographs. Photography should be repeated as new or different evidence on patients’ bodies is
found following the exam (e.g., bruising may appear days later). Create procedures that examiners, law
enforcement investigators, and patients follow to ensure this evidence is documented. In addition to
documenting emerging or evolving injuries, follow-up photographs provide documentation of healing or
resolving injuries and clarify findings of stable, normal variants in anatomy and nonspecific findings like
redness or swelling that could be confused with acute injuries.
Consider policies on storage, transfer, and retention of photographs. Photographs taken by examiners
should primarily be considered as part of the patient’s medical forensic record and should not be
automatically turned over to law enforcement. Law enforcement should be guided by the body diagrams
used in documentation in deciding what photographs to subpoena.
188 When bite mark evidence is presented, it may be helpful to consult a forensic odontologist, if one is available. However, this type of
evidence is controversial. It is more important to ensure swabbing of bite marks.
93946. Exam and Evidence Collection Procedures
Recommendations at a glance to facilitate the exam and evidence collection:
• Recognize the evidentiary purpose of the exam.
• Strive to collect as much evidence from patients as possible, guided by the scope of informed consent,
the medical forensic history, exam findings, and instructions in the evidence collection kit.
• Be aware of and document evidence and injuries that may be pertinent to the issue of whether the
patient consented to the sexual contact with the suspect.
• Understand how biological evidence is tested.
• Prevent exposure to infectious materials and risk of contamination of evidence.
• Understand the implications of the presence or absence of seminal evidence.
• Modify the exam and evidence collection to address the specific needs and concerns of patients.
• Explain exam and evidence collection procedures to patients.
• Conduct the general physical and anogenital exam and document findings on body diagram forms.
• Collect evidence to submit to the crime lab for analysis, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Collect other evidence.
• Keep medical specimens separate from evidentiary specimens collected during the exam.
Recognize the evidentiary purpose of the exam. During the exam, examiners methodically document
physical findings and facilitate the collection of evidence from patients’ bodies and clothing. The findings in
the exam and collected evidence often provide information to help reconstruct the details about the events in
question in an objective and scientific manner.189 Of course, health care needs and concerns of patients may
be presented in the course of the exam that should be addressed prior to discharge. However, patients must
understand that the exam does not provide routine medical care. For example, a pap smear will not be done
during the female pelvic exam.190 (This chapter focuses on evidentiary components of the exam. Other
chapters in the protocol discuss more fully medical and other related needs and concerns of patients.)
Collect as much evidence from patients as possible, guided by the scope of informed consent, the
medical forensic history, exam findings, and instructions in the evidence collection kit. Evidence
collected during the exam mainly includes biological and trace evidence. To reconstruct the events in
question, evidence collected is used in four potential ways in sexual assault cases:
• To identify the suspect;
• To document recent sexual contact;
• To document force, threat, or fear; and
• To corroborate the facts of the assault.
Be aware of and document evidence and injuries that may be pertinent to the issue of whether the
patient consented to the sexual contact with the suspect. In the majority of sexual assaults, patients
know the suspects. For example, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, in 2008, 57 percent
of rapes/sexual assaults involved offenders who were nonstrangers.191 Most nonstranger suspects and many
stranger suspects (if confronted by professionals in the criminal justice system) will claim that the patient
consented to the sexual contact.192 Consent claims typically stem from a lack of evidence and documentation
concerning force and coercion. Thus, evidence and documentation of physical findings related to whether
189 Note that while exam findings and evidence collected from patients are important in reconstructing the events in question, during a
criminal investigation, law enforcement officials look for additional evidence that will create a more complete picture of the event.

95force or coercion was used against patients (e.g., findings that reveal injuries, alcohol or drugs taken
involuntarily, or signs of a struggle) are important in these types of cases. However, the absence of physical
trauma does not mean that coercion/force was not used or prove that patients consented to sexual contact.193
Also, some physical findings that suggest force are not necessarily indicative of a sexual assault. It is
important to remember that if an investigation takes place, law enforcement officials will look for additional
evidence that may help to overcome a claim of consent.
Understand how biological evidence is tested.194 Semen, blood, vaginal secretions, saliva, vaginal
epithelial cells, and other biological evidence may be identified and profiled by a crime lab. The information
derived from the analysis can often help determine whether sexual contact occurred, provide information
regarding the circumstances of the incident, and be compared to reference samples collected from patients
and suspects for identification purposes. A primary method used by crime labs for testing biological evidence
is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis.195 The most common form of DNA analysis used in crime labs for
identification is called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR allows the analysis of evidence samples of
limited quality and quantity by making millions of copies of very small amounts of DNA. Using an advanced
form of PCR testing called “short tandem repeats” (STR); the laboratory is able to generate a DNA profile,
which can be compared to DNA from a suspect or a crime scene.196
Distinguish patients’ DNA from suspects’ DNA. Blood or buccal (inner cheek) swabbings should be collected
from patients for DNA analysis to distinguish their DNA from that of suspects. (Procedures for collecting
these samples are provided later in this chapter.) If the case is reported to law enforcement, patients’
biological samples and DNA profiles should be used only for investigation of the sexual assault, and their
DNA profiles should not be uploaded into CODIS.197 Neither biological samples nor DNA profiles should be
provided to law enforcement or prosecution for another case in which patients may be suspects,
inadvertently given to health insurance carriers, or used for research purposes without patients’ consent.198
Criminal justice agency policies should be in place and followed for the secure storage of biological samples
and appropriate disposal of these samples and DNA profiles.
Prevent exposure to infectious materials and risk of contamination of evidence. Examiners should take
precautions during the exam to prevent exposure (to both patients and health care staff) to bloodborne
pathogens and other potentially infectious materials. For example, it is important to follow facility policies on
washing hands, handling contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps, wearing protective
equipment, and minimizing splashing, spraying, and spattering of these materials. (For more information on
this topic, see B.1. Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners.)
With the ever-increasing sensitivity of DNA analysis, there is a greater chance that accidental contamination
can be detected. Forensic evidence, which is usually small in volume, can be contaminated and diluted by
foreign DNA. Every precaution should be taken by all first responders to reduce outside contamination and
dilution of evidence. For example, examiners should wear non-powdered gloves199 and change them
throughout the exam/evidence collection whenever cross-contamination could occur or when moving to
different body surface areas. Examiners and other responders should seek guidance from their crime labs on
procedures to prevent contamination.

195 DNA determines each person’s individual characteristics. An individual’s DNA is unique except in identical twins. DNA in the cell
nucleus is genetic material inherited from biological parents. (Drawn from Arkansas’ Sexual Assault: A Hospital/Community Protocol for
Forensic and Medical Examination, 2001.)
196 There is a concern that if DNA evidence is found, prosecutors may not utilize other evidence, especially when labs have limited
resources. But because persons known to victims commit the vast majority of sexual assaults, DNA findings must be used in
conjunction with other forensic evidence recovered, particularly when issues of consent arise. Law enforcement investigators and
prosecutors should receive training on maximizing the use of all forensic evidence collected.
197 In the fall of 2003, legislation was introduced to implement the President’s DNA Initiative provisions that would bar the inclusion of
elimination samples in CODIS. These samples include those obtained from sexual assault victims, as well as individuals with whom they
had recent consensual sex prior to the exam.
198 An exception is that a forensic lab may input frequency information related to the DNA profiles in its statistical database. Victims’
identity remains anonymous.

96Understand the implications of the presence or absence of seminal evidence.200 The relevance of
semen evidence in cases involving male suspects covers the spectrum, depending upon case facts. Semen
is composed of cellular and liquid components known as spermatozoa (sperm) and seminal fluid. Semen
evidence is valuable because it can be used to positively identify suspects. 201 However, it is critical to note
that failure to recover semen is not an indication that a sexual assault did not occur. There are a number of
reasons why semen might not be recovered in these cases: Assailants may have used condoms, ejaculated
somewhere other than in an orifice or on patients’ clothes or bodies, or not ejaculated at all. Semen may
have been depleted by frequent ejaculation prior to the sample in question.202 Chronic alcohol or drug abuse,
chemotherapy, cancer, infection (e.g., mumps or tuberculosis), or congenital abnormalities also may
suppress semen production. Other factors may contribute to the absence of detectable amounts of semen
evidence. For example, significant time delays between the assault and collection of evidence may cause
loss of semen evidence, semen may be washed away prior to the exam or improperly collected, and an
object other than a penis may have been used for penetration.
Modify the exam and evidence collection to address the specific needs and concerns of patients.
Examiners should be aware that patients’ beliefs might affect whether and how certain evidence is collected.
For example, patients from certain cultures or religious backgrounds may view hair or fingernails as sacred
and decline collection of hair evidence. (For more information on this topic, see A.2. Victim-Centered Care.
Accommodating mobility impairments is discussed in footnotes for this chapter. For details on
accommodating communication needs and responding to verbal and nonverbal cues, see C.4. The Medical
Forensic History.)
Explain exam and evidence collection procedures to patients. Whatever the methods used for seeking
informed consent from patients for the exam and evidence collection, the full nature of procedures and
options should be explained. Examiners may provide some basic information prior to starting the exam and
additional information as the exam proceeds. For example, if specialized equipment is used, examiners can
explain to patients, at some point prior to its use, what the equipment is, how it will be used, for what
purpose, and how long the procedure will take. Encourage patients to ask questions and to inform examiners
if they need a break or do not want a particular part of the exam or evidence collection done. (For more
information on obtaining informed consent of patients, see A.3. Informed Consent.)
Conduct the general physical and anogenital exam and document the physical findings on body
diagram forms.203 In addition to instructions included in the evidence collection kit, the exam should be
guided by the scope of informed consent and the medical forensic history.
In the course of the exam, examiners may question patients about trauma related to the assault. These
questions should be specific enough to yield clinically relevant information. For example, simply asking if
patients are injured or hurt anywhere is not focused enough—they may not know where they are injured until
examined and/or asked questions such as if they hurt in specific body locations.
General physical examination. Obtain patients’ vital signs, note the date and time of the exam, physical
appearance, general demeanor, behavior, and orientation, and condition of clothing on arrival. Record all
physical findings (which include observable or palpable tissue injuries; physiologic changes; and foreign
materials such as grass, sand, stains, dried or moist secretions, or positive fluorescence) on body diagram
forms. Be observant for redness, abrasions, bruises, swelling, lacerations, fractures, bites, burns, and other
forms of physical trauma. Potential traumatic findings should be palpated to assess for tenderness and
induration. On dark-skinned individuals, it may be difficult to identify these areas and they may need to be
sought out specifically.

201 In the absence of sperm, certain seminal fluid components may be used to identify semen.
202 If assailants who had a vasectomy ejaculated, their seminal fluid would not contain sperm.
203 This section on performing the exam is primarily drawn from the American College of Emergency Physicians’ (ACEP) Evaluation and
Management of the Sexually Assaulted or Sexually Abused Patient, 1999, pp. 103–107. Much of the ACEP exam procedures were
based on the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims.
97Anogenital examination.204 During the female genital exam,205 examine the external genitalia and perineal
area for injury, foreign materials, and other findings in the following areas: abdomen, thighs, perineum, labia
majora, labia minora, clitorial hood and surrounding area, perurethral tissue/urethral meatus, hymen,206 fossa
navicularis, and posterior fourchette. The use of a colposcope during the external genital exam enhances
viewing microscopic trauma and may provide photographic documentation.207
Then examine the vagina and cervix for injury, foreign materials, and foreign bodies. Use a colposcope or
other magnifying device if available. In some jurisdictions, toluidine blue dye may be used to highlight
trauma, either with or without the use of a colposcope.208 Examine the buttocks, perianal skin, and anal folds
for injury, foreign materials, and other findings. If rectal penetration is reported or suspected, an anoscope
can be used as a tool to identify and evaluate trauma (it may also be used to help obtain anal swabs and
trace evidence).
For male patients, examine the external and perineal area for injury, foreign materials, and other findings,
including from the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, foreskin, urethral meatus, shaft, scrotum, perineum, glans, and
testes. Document whether patients are circumcised.
Documentation of findings. Record findings from the general physical and anogenital exam on appropriate
body diagram forms. Detailed descriptions of findings should be provided as required. During the exam,
collect evidence as specified in the evidence collection kit and photograph anatomy involved in the assault
according to jurisdictional policy. Follow jurisdictional policy regarding documentation, photography, and
collection of bite mark evidence.209
Collect evidence to submit to the crime lab for analysis, according to jurisdictional policy.210 The
following evidence from patients, along with completed documentation forms, typically is submitted to the
crime lab designated by the jurisdiction.211 Jurisdictions may require collection of additional or different
204 If patients are mobility impaired, review their history at this stage. In patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), the level of injury and any
history of autonomic dysreflexia will have to be noted and given special attention. Other considerations in these patients are histories of
muscle spasm and triggers for both muscle spasm and autonomic dysreflexia. Examiners should be sure to ask about things such as
whether these patients have ever had a speculum exam, what this experience was like, what the most comfortable position would be for
the anogenital exam, and any history of autonomic dysreflexia with a speculum exam. (Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s SANE
Protocol, 2002, p. 36.) Transgender individuals with a masculine identity and those with a constructed vagina may sustain additional
physical and emotional damage when vaginally assaulted.
205 Some patients may not have previously had a gynecological exam and need a detailed explanation and support during this part of
the exam. (Drawn from L. Zarate, 2003, Suggestions for Upgrading the Cultural Competency Skills of SARTs, Arte Sana Web site,

206 The Tanner Scale of Secondary Sexual Development is a sexual maturity rating scale that defines a child’s stage of puberty.
(American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, Glossary of Terms and the Interpretation of Findings for Child Sexual Abuse
Evidentiary Examinations, p. 7.) These developmental stages are relevant to the interpretation of physical findings in child and
adolescent cases. There is a relationship between Tanner Stages and hymenal development. Physical findings must be evaluated in the
context of hymenal development for the interpretation of findings. (The California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault
and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p. 61.)
207 Colposcopes have magnifying lenses ranging from 4x to 30x power and can have 35-mm camera or video camera attachments.
Colposcopes have a green filter that enhances the visualization of scars, unusual vascular patterns, and genital warts. Examiners can
use the colposcope to obtain magnified images of the oral pharynx, genital, and rectal areas. Minor skin and/or mucosal trauma such as
abrasions, lacerations, petechiae, focal edema, hymeneal tears, and anal fissures are more easily seen with magnification, and
photographs can be taken for documentation. Attached video cameras can also record images. (Drawn from the California Medical
Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p. 58).
208 The use of toluidine blue dye is controversial in some jurisdictions (e.g., it may be perceived by the court as changing the appearance
of the tissue) and not universally used. When employed, toluidine blue dye (1-percent aqueous solution) should be applied by cotton
swab before any internal or digital speculum examination. Although DNA evidence will be preserved, care should be taken to avoid
letting dye enter the vaginal vault. Excess dye may be blotted away with 1-percent acetic acid solution or lubricating jelly. Toluidine blue
dye cannot separate consensual from nonconsensual lesions. Patients should be advised that small traces of the dye might shed in their
clothing over the 2 days following the exam. (Information on use of this dye is drawn from the American College of Emergency
Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually Assaulted or Abused Patient, 1999, p. 117.)
209 In addition to documenting, swabbing, and photographing bite marks, an odontologist may need to make casts. Without a cast, teeth
cannot be matched to suspects. The American College of Emergency Physicians’ Evaluation and Management of the Sexually
Assaulted or Abused Patient, 1999, pp. 111–112, offers guidelines for bite mark documentation.

Assaulted or Abused Patient, 1999, pp. 103–107.
211 In some cases, it may be appropriate to submit evidence to the FBI Laboratory. It accepts cases from any duly authorized law
enforcement agency. However, if the case is not a FBI case and the jurisdiction has capability to analyze DNA, then the DNA Unit of the
FBI Lab will generally not accept the case. Cases that occur on Indian reservations may be submitted directly to the FBI Lab from local
or tribal law enforcement agencies, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the FBI and will be worked on by the Indian Country Evidence Task
98specimens. Trained examiners should use the medical forensic history and the physical assessment of the
patient to guide the evidence collection process. Instructions supplied in the kit may be helpful as a guide for
those who are not experienced in the process of evidence collection. However, it should be recognized that
the kit instructions should not be read in front of the patient, which could be cause further emotional trauma
in the aftermath of the assault. If any requested evidence is not collected, examiners should note reasons on
documentation forms.
Collect clothing evidence. Clothing frequently contains important evidence in sexual assault cases. It
provides a surface upon which traces of foreign materials, such as semen, saliva, blood, hairs, fibers, and
debris from the crime scene, may be found. While foreign matter can be washed off or worn off the body, the
same substances often can be found intact on clothing for a considerable length of time following an assault.
Damaged or torn clothing may be significant, as damage may be evidence of force (do not cut through any
existing holes, rips, or stains on clothing). If the examiner detects damage to the clothing, ask the patient if
that damage was related to the assault or present prior to the events in question. Evidence on patients’
clothing can be compared with evidence collected from suspects and crime scenes. Common items collected
from patients include underwear, hosiery, blouses, shirts, and pants. Coats and shoes are collected less
frequently because they are less likely to have evidentiary value and their loss may represent a significant
financial burden for victims.212 Transgender individuals may be unwilling to part with prostheses and similar
items for reasons of safety and/or cost.
Procedures for collecting clothing, underwear, and foreign material dislodged while undressing include the
following:
• Place a clean hospital sheet on the floor as a barrier. Then place the collection paper on the barrier
sheet. Be careful to prevent evidence transfer. Document all findings. Ask patients to disrobe
(assisting them as requested and then draping them appropriately).213 When disrobing, have
patients remove shoes and then undress over the collection paper to catch any foreign material that
is dislodged.214 If someone assists, she/he should wear gloves.
• Collect clothing pertinent to the assault. First determine if patients are wearing the same clothes
worn either during or immediately following the assault. If so, the clothing should be examined for
any apparent foreign material, stains, or damage. When the determination has been made that
items may contain possible evidence, those items should be collected. If it is determined that
patients are not wearing the same clothing that they did either during or immediately after the
assault, examiners should inquire as to the location of that clothing. If that clothing has not been
brought to the exam site, information on clothing location should be provided to law enforcement (if
involved) so that clothing can be retrieved and examined before any potential evidence is
destroyed.215 In addition to collecting underwear worn at the time of or immediately after the assault,
it may also be important to collect underwear patients are wearing at the time of the exam (if
relevant to the case).
• Be sensitive about how much clothing to take as evidence. For example, take patients’ coats or
shoes only if it is determined that there may be evidence on them. The exam site can coordinate
with advocacy programs to ensure that replacement clothing is available for patients in a range of
Force. Should a jurisdictional lab not have a hair examiner but have the capability to analyze DNA, items requiring only DNA analysis
should not be submitted. Items such as clothing that will be examined for both DNA and trace evidence should be submitted to the FBI
Lab first. These items will be returned after processing for trace evidence and can then be sent along with DNA-only evidence to the
jurisdictional lab. Do not submit items to the FBI Lab for trace evidence analysis after they have been previously examined by another
lab. For more information or help submitting a case to the FBI Lab, contact your local FBI office or see the Handbook of Forensic
Services at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/handbook-of-forensic-services-pdf.

213 If patients are concerned about disrobing in front of advocates and/or personal support persons, they can turn around, hold up a
sheet to shield patients, or leave the room while patients disrobe.
214 For patients with mobility impairments, put the foreign material collection sheet on the exam table and leave in place until the exam is
completed. If patients prefer to disrobe in their wheelchairs, sheets can be tucked in around the wheelchair to catch debris. Avoid putting
chairs on paper, as debris from wheels may contaminate evidence. (Commonwealth of Massachusetts SANE Protocol, 2002, p. 33.)

99sizes. This clothing is critical in some instances (e.g., a patient may own only the clothing that is
being collected).
• If female or transgender male patients are menstruating, collect tampons and sanitary napkins. Air-
dry them as much as possible and then place them in a separate paper collection bag.
• Follow jurisdictional policy for handling and transporting wet evidence that cannot be dried
thoroughly at the exam site (e.g., wet clothing, tampons, and sanitary napkins). Ensure that it is
packaged in leak-proof containers and separated from other evidence when being transported. It is
critical to alert involved law enforcement representatives and crime lab personnel about the
presence of wet evidence and the need for its immediate analysis or further drying.216
• After drying items according to jurisdictional policy, place each piece of clothing and collection paper
in a separate paper bag, label, seal, and initial the seal. If additional bags are needed, use new
grocery-style paper bags only. The barrier sheet is not submitted as evidence.
• Tape/seal bags closed; label, seal,217 and initial the seal.
Collect debris.218
• Collect obvious debris on patients’ bodies (e.g., dirt, leaves, fibers, and hair) on a collection sheet—
package, label, seal, and initial the seal.
• Fingernail evidence: ask patients whether they scratched the suspects’ face, body, or clothing. If so,
or if fibers of other materials are observed under patients’ fingernails, collect fingernail clippings,
scrapings, and/or swabbings, according to jurisdictional policy.219 If fingernail scrapings are
collected, package fingernail scrapings and tools used to obtain the sample, label, seal, and initial
the seal. Cut broken fingernails at the remaining jagged edge for later comparison. If artificial
fingernails or nail extensions are being worn by the patient, another nail should be enclosed as a
known sample if one is missing. Package, label, seal, and initial the seals.
• If requested, assist patients in putting on exam gowns after clothing and debris are collected.
Collect foreign materials and swabs from the surface of the body. Carefully inspect the body, including head,
hair, and scalp, for dried or moist secretions and stains (e.g., blood, seminal fluid, sweat, and saliva) and
other foreign material. Use an alternate light source to assist in identifying evidence. Obtain swabs from any
suspicious area that may be a dry secretion or stain, any moist secretion, any area that fluoresces with
longwave ultraviolet light, and any area for which patients relate a history or suspicion of bodily fluid transfer
(e.g., licking, kissing, biting, splashed semen, or suction injury). Also collect swabs from potentially high-yield
areas (e.g., neck, breasts, or external genitalia) if the history is absent or incomplete.
• Use a moist swab to collect dry secretions, followed by a dry swab. Swab moist secretions with a dry
swab. Separate swabs should be used for every sample area collected. Follow jurisdictional policies
regarding the number of swabs required to collect each specimen.
• Swab bite marks. In some jurisdictions, an initial moist swabbing followed by a dry swabbing has
been shown to result in full DNA profiles.
• Optional—smear swabs onto microscope slides, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Cut matted head, facial, or pubic hairs bearing crusted material (or flake off material if possible) and
place in an envelope.
• According to jurisdictional policy, air-dry all specimens, package swabs and slides separately, label,
seal, and initial the seals. Note that coding of evidence must allow the crime lab to know which swab
was used to prepare which slide.
• If teeth are flossed prior to oral swab collection, package used floss (if available), label, seal, and
initial the seal.

217 Do not use saliva to seal envelopes; rather, try using moistened gauze pads or paper towels. (Drawn from Connecticut’s Video
Training Program, Part 1, The Examination: Sexual Assault Evidence Collection, 1998.)
218 Debris-containing evidence may be found on equipment, such as wheelchairs, scooters, canes, wheelchair pads, assistive
communication devices, catheters, and service animals, used by some patients with physical impairments. Swab equipment and/or
animals for evidence, if appropriate, according to jurisdictional policy. Always ask patients for permission to do so.
219 Some jurisdictions routinely collect fingernail samples and photograph fingernail damage that may have been related to the assault.
100Collect hair combings. Follow jurisdictional policy for collecting hair combings. The purpose of this procedure
is to collect hair shed by suspects that may have been transferred to patients’ hair. Hair combings may also
reveal other foreign materials. It is important to examine head, facial, and pubic hair for secretions, foreign
materials, and debris and collect as appropriate (see above for collection of debris and foreign materials).
Pubic hair combings may be necessary if the assault involved the genital area of patients, according to
jurisdictional policy. To collect pubic hair combings:
• Use the comb and collection paper provided for this procedure.
• Place the unfolded paper under patients’ buttocks and comb hair toward paper (patients may comb).
• Fold comb with debris/hair into paper. Package paper, label, seal, and initial the seal.
Collect hair reference samples as needed.220 Follow jurisdictional policy for collection of hair reference
samples.221 Many jurisdictions do not routinely collect plucked head and pubic hair reference samples. Some
will only collect these samples if the lab requests it at a later time. In other jurisdictions, both samples are
collected routinely unless otherwise indicated or declined by patients.222 Whatever the jurisdictional policy,
patients should always be informed about the purpose of collection, procedures used to collect samples,
discomfort that may be involved, and how these samples may be used during the investigation and
prosecution. If hair reference samples are not collected at the initial exam, it is important to inform patients
that there might be a need to collect these samples for crime lab analysis at a later date. They should be
aware that hair evidence collected at a later date may not be as conclusive as if it is collected at the time of
the initial exam (e.g., due to the fact that hair characteristics can change over time).
When these samples are collected, the indications, timing, and techniques vary. Jurisdictional policies should
be in place and followed. Give patients the option of collecting samples themselves.
Collect oral and anogenital swabs and smears. Patients’ consent, the medical forensic history, and exam
findings should guide collection of oral and anogenital specimens. In general, specimens should be collected
only from orifices and areas surrounding the orifices that patients report to be involved in the assault.223 Keep
in mind that some patients may be vague about the type(s) of sexual contact that occurred. Examiners can
help clarify which orifices were involved by asking appropriate questions. If there is uncertainty about
involved orifices (e.g., because patients have little memory of the assault, were unconscious or incoherent,
or do not understand what occurred), collection from oral, vaginal, and anal orifices (with patients’
permission) may be appropriate. In some jurisdictions, policy calls for collection from all three orifices. Again,
patients’ consent is needed to collect these samples. Things to note when collecting these swabs and
smears:
• Caution patients who use a bathroom prior to the exam that evidence may be present in pubic,
genital, and anal areas and urge them not to wash or wipe away secretions until after evidence
collection.
• When taking a swab, examiners should take care not to contaminate the collection with secretions or
materials from other areas, such as vaginal to rectal or penile to rectal.
220 See footnote under hair combing regarding patients with limited mobility.
221 Crime labs use reference samples to determine whether or not evidence specimens collected are foreign to patients. There is a lack
of consensus across jurisdictions about whether to collect these samples routinely during the initial exam. Head and pubic hair reference
samples from patients can provide a source of comparative information for forensic scientists, but these samples are not needed in
many cases and can be retrieved from patients at a later date if necessary. If the samples are not taken at the time of the exam,
however, patients may be reluctant to return later for collection. Also, hair characteristics may change over time. For patients, gathering
these samples can be a painful and embarrassing procedure that follows the trauma of the assault. But, given the choice of having
samples taken at the initial exam or at a later date, many opt to get it over with during the exam. Hair pulled or cut from patients is rarely
used to prosecute a case. With the advent of DNA technology, the court’s use of these reference samples declined. Yet, particularly in
cases where DNA evidence is not available, hair reference samples could be useful evidence. SARTs (or involved responders) should
ensure that their decisions about collecting hair reference samples reflect current best forensic practices, advances in technology, and
the need for sensitivity to patients.
222 Note that a patient may believe hair is sacred and thus may be reluctant or decline to have hair evidence collected.
223 It is important to note, however, that there is a lack of consistency across jurisdictions as to whether specimen collection from all
orifices is routine or conducted on a case-by-case basis, based on the assault history and exam findings.
101• Follow jurisdictional policy for collecting swabs (and the number of swabs used to collect a sample),
smearing swabs on slides, and drying and packaging swabs and slides. Also, follow jurisdictional
policy for timeframes in which samples should be collected unless otherwise indicated.
• Do not stain or chemically fix swabs or smears.
• When preparing slides, note that coding of evidence material must allow the crime lab to know which
swab was used to prepare which slide.
• Document any foreign substance or material introduced by health care providers (e.g., lubricating
jelly on a speculum or betadine prior to introduction of a catheter).
Oral sample224
• Place swabs together to collect specimen from oral cavity between gums and cheeks and under
tongue. Remove dentures and swab with same swabs.
• Optional—smear swabs onto two microscopic slides.
• Air-dry swabs and slides.
• Package slides and swabs, place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
External genital sample225
• Swab external genital dry-skin areas with swabs (blind swabbing by protocol or history), at least one
dry and one moistened with a drop of sterile, distilled, or deionized water, according to jurisdictional
policy.
• Optional—smear swabs on two microscope slides.
• Air-dry swabs and slides.
• Package slides and swabs, place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
Vaginal/cervical sample
• Use swabs together to collect a sample from vaginal pool. It is prudent to collect swabs from both
the vagina and cervix, regardless of time between assault and exam.
• Optional—smear swabs onto microscope slides.
• Air dry swabs and slides.
• Package slides and swabs, place in envelope, label (specifically indicating sampling site), seal, and
initial the seal.
Wet-mount evaluation.226 Some jurisdictions require examiners to conduct wet-mount examinations of
vaginal/cervical secretions for motile and nonmotile sperm in cases in which a male suspect may have
ejaculated in a patient’s vagina.227 Because sperm motility decreases quickly with time and removal from the
vagina/cervix,228 wet-mount evaluation during the exam can provide the only opportunity to see sperm
motility.229 The presence of motile sperm may help narrow the timeframe that the crime could have occurred.
224 One jurisdiction also collects a lip/lip area swab and smear and an oral rinse if there was oral contact.
225 Note that cleansing the area for catheterization and/or applying Lidocaine may dilute or contaminate the evidence. Therefore, when
Lidocaine is applied to the perineal and anal areas to minimize the risk of autonomic dysreflexia, it should be done only after swabbing
the external genitalia for evidence. If catheterization is required either for evidence collection or to empty the bladder for speculum
examination, it should be done only after swabbing the external genitalia. (Commonwealth of Massachusetts SANE Protocol, 2002, p.
38.)
226 Note for clarity that this and the next paragraph discuss wet-mount evaluation for sperm. However, wet-mount evaluation of vaginal
secretions for infection (e.g., yeast infection and STIs) may also be done during the exam if medically or forensically indicated. Hospital
lab personnel usually analyze these samples.
227 If and when wet-mount evaluation for sperm is done, examiners should exercise discretion conducting this procedure in the presence
of patients and be sensitive in explaining the implications of positive and negative wet mounts to patients (if they want to know).
Examiners should remind law enforcement investigators that a lack of sperm does not mean an assault did not occur and that the crime
lab will later examine prepared slides using stains and other techniques not available to examiners. Thus, if sperm is present, the lab’s
rate of identification will probably be higher than it was for examiners. Providing this information might help deter misinterpretation of
results.
228 In most cases, sperm becomes nonmotile in the vagina within 10 to 12 hours after ejaculation. (Drawn from W. Green, M. Kaufhold,
and E. Schulman, Sexual Assault Evidentiary Exam Training for Health Care Providers, Participant Manual, 2001, p. 39 of Module 7.)
Both motile and nonmotile sperm may be found in the cervix for longer periods of time after the assault than in the vagina. Sperm may
not be found after an assault for many reasons (see section in this chapter on the importance of semen evidence).
229 Drawn from W. Green, M. Kaufhold, and E. Schulman, Sexual Assault Evidentiary Exam Training for Health Care Providers,
Participant Manual, 2001, p. 39 of Module 7.
102In most jurisdictions, however, the crime lab is responsible for all analysis of evidence230 and examiners do
not do the wet-mount evaluation for sperm.231 Follow jurisdictional policy on whether wet-mount evaluation
for sperm is needed and methods of evaluation. If it is required, examiners must be educated on use of the
microscope, identification of sperm, and reporting their findings and have quakuty assurance mechanisms in
place to assure the accuracy of their findings.
• If necessary, prepare a wet-mount slide according to jurisdictional policy. Dab one swab collected
from the vaginal pool on a slide.232 Typically, the slide is prepared by placing one drop of normal
saline onto the “dab” of vaginal material just placed on the slide. Place a cover slip on the slide.
• View for presence of sperm under a microscope at 400x or by using a phase contrast or other
optically staining microscope (within 10 minutes of preparing slide).233
• Air-dry this swab and slide (not removing the cover slip).
• Package swab and slide, place in envelope, label as “wet mount” (specifically indicating sampling
site), seal, and initial the seal.
While the speculum is still in place and after all swabs and evidence have been collected, any necessary
medical cultures may be taken, if medically indicated.
Penile sample
• Slightly moisten swabs with distilled water and thoroughly swab the external surface of the penile
shaft and glans. Swab all outer areas of the penis and scrotum where contact is suspected. Avoid
swabbing the urethral meatus.
• Gently roll the swabs over one of the microscope slides, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Air-dry swabs and slides.
• Package slides and swabs, place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seals.
Immediately following this procedure, any necessary medical cultures should be taken.
Perineal area sample234
• If there was vaginal/anal contact, there may be leakage of semen in the perineal area. Use an
alternate light source on the anal area and flake off or swab areas of dried secretions using a moist
swab followed by a dry swab.
• Optional—smear swabs on microscopic slides, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Flaked dried secretions should be placed into the provided container. Air-dry swabs and slides and
package them separately. Place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
• Avoid contaminating anal/rectal samples by cleansing the perianal area after external secretions and
foreign materials have been collected.
Anal/rectal sample235
230 A possible exception may be toxicology analysis.
231 While crime labs can reliably identify the presence of sperm on permanent stained slides, they cannot identify motile sperm due to
time delays. Information about the presence or absence of sperm and motile sperm obtained at the time of the exam can impact the
investigation and patients’ decision making. One concern related to examiners doing wet-mount evaluations for sperm is that their
findings may be different than those of crime labs (e.g., the examiner may not detect sperm, while the crime lab does).
232 Alternate methods for obtaining materials for wet mounts: a sample may be collected from a vaginal aspirate or fluid from the lower
bill of speculum after withdrawing it from vagina, or sperm are occasionally found on microscopic urinalysis. (W. Green, M. Kaufhold,
and E. Schulman, Sexual Assault Evidentiary Exam Training for Health Care Providers, Participant Manual, 2001, p. 38 of Module 7.)
233 Examiners rather than hospital lab personnel should view these slides. Otherwise, delays between preparation of slides in the exam
room and analysis in the hospital lab could cause a negative result (e.g., sperm present, but not motile). Also, those involved in the
chain of custody of this evidence should be kept to a minimum.
234 See the next footnote for patients with spinal cord injury and/or history of autonomic dysreflexia.
235 Note that for patients with spinal cord injury and/or history of autonomic dysreflexia, collection of anal/rectal samples is performed
only with the highest level of awareness of risks and with observance of precautionary steps. Possible triggers for autonomic dysreflexia
are anxiety, pelvic exam (a cold speculum or the pressure of manipulating a speculum or manipulation of the cervix and pressure on the
uterus), rectal exam or swabbing, impacted bowel, urinary retention, a kinked catheter, a bladder infection, and deep skin lesion. Some
symptoms are highly elevated blood pressure, nasal congestion, sudden onset of headache, flushing, sweating, shortness of breath,
and muscle spasm. Precautions against a possible attack requires an empty bladder or leg bag for the exam; application of lidocaine gel
to perineum and/or anal area before exam; examination performed in a semi-supine position; slow insertion and minimal manipulation of
a warm speculum; constant monitoring of blood pressure and “checking in” with patients; having rapid acting anti-hypertensive
103• Collect swabs from the anal cavity. 236 Avoid contact with external skin surfaces.
• Optional—smear swabs on microscopic slides, according to jurisdictional policy.
• Air-dry swabs and slides.
• Package swabs and slides, place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
At this time, any additional examinations or tests involving the anus should be conducted.
Known blood or saliva sample or buccal (inner cheek) swab for DNA analysis and comparison. Many
samples collected during the exam contain a mixture of secretions. To interpret DNA profile results obtained
from these swabs, it is essential to know the DNA profile of patients. Patients’ DNA reference samples are
used for this purpose. Follow jurisdictional policy regarding the type of samples accepted by the crime lab.
Collection of a buccal swab or saliva sample is encouraged unless it is medically or forensically necessary to
take blood. If a blood sample is collected, the most noninvasive method of collection should be used.
Buccal swabs: Decide on a case-by-case basis whether it is appropriate to collect a buccal swab reference
sample for DNA typing rather than a blood sample. For example, a blood sample may not be needed or
patients might not allow blood to be drawn. (Note that buccal swabs and saliva samples are not suitable for
blood typing and serology.) If oral copulation is asserted or suspected, a buccal swab or saliva sample for
patients’ DNA reference may be contaminated. In those cases, blood is usually the better reference sample.
However, examiners should consult local crime labs to ensure their collection methods reflect the lab’s
preferred method.
• Buccal swab: Have patients rinse their mouths with tap water and then expose the inner cheek
area. Swab this area with gentle pressure. Air-dry the swab, package, place in envelope, label,
seal, and initial the seal.
Dry Blood
• If drawn blood is not being collected for medical or toxicological purposes, consider dry blood
collection because it is a less invasive method of blood collection and is easier to store.237
• Using a betadine swab, wipe the tip of the left or right ring finger.
• Using a sterile lancet, prick the finger.
• While holding the finger over the circles on the blood collection card, milk the finger, allowing two
drops of blood to fall in a circle. Repeat procedure for any remaining circles as required by
jurisdictional policy (it may not be necessary to fill all circles).
• Allow blood to air-dry according to jurisdictional policy. Fill out the patient’s name on the first line.
Package according to jurisdictional policy, then place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
Drawn Blood
• In order to minimize patients’ discomfort, collect drawn blood needed for the reference sample at the
same time blood is collected for medical or toxicological purposes.
• Blood for the reference sample may be collected in lavender-top and/or yellow-top blood drawing
tubes. These colored tubes contain preservatives suitable for forensic blood typing. The color to use
medication on hand; and making health care staff aware of risks and on alert. Treatment for autonomic dysreflexia includes stopping the
exam, bringing patients to sitting or semi-supine position, and involving emergency medical staff immediately who can administer a fast-
acting anti-hypertensive medication. (Commonwealth of Massachusetts SANE Protocol, 2002, p. 40.)
236 If needed, an anoscope can be used to identify anal injuries and obtain anal swabs after perianal cleansing. These swabs should be
obtained by direct visualization from the rectal mucosa visible above the tip of the anoscope. If patients are unable to tolerate a water-
moistened anoscope or anal speculum, lightly coat the instrument with lidocaine jelly or use manual traction and obtain samples from
the anal canal. If a lubricant (other than water or saline) or lidocaine jelly is used, document its use and the reason for it. (The California
Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001, p. 48.) The examiner should use discretion
in determining whether a case warrants the use of the anoscope for medical and/or forensic purposes, as well as obtain patients’
informed consent for anoscopy. Particularly if a patient has been anorectally penetrated, that patient may be uncomfortable with the use
of the anoscope and could possibly even feel revictimized by it. The discomfort this procedure may cause the patient should be weighed
against its potential medical or forensic uses.
237 Several state protocols indicate dry blood collection is an acceptable method to obtain known DNA samples.
104is typically specified by the designated crime lab.238 If tubes are included in the evidence collection
kit, check expiration dates and replace if expired.239 Mix according to jurisdictional policy.
• Write the patient’s name, date and time of collection, and the collector’s initials on the tube.
Package according to jurisdictional policy, then place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
Collect other evidence. Other evidence may be collected beyond what is needed for the sexual assault
evidence collection kit. This could include toxicology samples or other evidence based on the unique facts
and circumstances of the case.
Miscellaneous swabs may be collected, depending upon the area of contact noted in the medical forensic
history. Some jurisdictions are collecting wet to dry swabs from the surfaces surrounding orifices that were
penetrated or that had touch contact during an assault (e.g. area surrounding the mouth in the case of an
oral assault, or the inner thighs in a vaginal penetration).
Toxicology samples. Make the decision about whether to collect toxicology samples for forensic purposes,
what to collect, and collection methods according to jurisdictional policy. Do not put toxicology samples in
the sexual assault evidence collection kit, unless otherwise indicated. Identify which forensic labs the
jurisdiction has selected to analyze these samples, choose a lab, and follow transfer policies. (See C.7.
Alcohol- and Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault for more information on collecting toxicology samples.)
Dental floss. Use of dental floss is not recommended for additional evidence collection in cases with oral
penetration. Flossing can create increased opportunity for infection through microtrauma to the gums.
Keep medical specimens separate from evidentiary specimens collected during the exam. Specimens
collected for medical purposes should be kept and processed at the medical facility, and specimens collected
for forensic analysis should be transferred to the crime laboratory or other specified laboratories for analysis
(with patients’ consent). It is not necessary to maintain the chain of custody on medical specimens—instead,
follow exam facility policy for documenting medical care and storing medical records. Exam sites that
perform exams for military installations should consider Memoranda of Understanding to address such
issues as storage of evidence.

1051067. Alcohol and Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault
Recommendations at a glance to facilitate response in suspected alcohol- and drug-facilitated sexual
assault:
• Promote training and develop jurisdictional policies.
• Plan response to voluntary use of drugs and/or alcohol by patients.
• Be clear about the circumstances in which toxicology testing may be indicated. Routine testing is not
recommended.
• Toxicology testing procedures should be explained to patients.
• Toxicology samples should be collected as soon as possible after a suspected drug-facilitated case is
identified and informed consent is obtained, even if patients are undecided about reporting to law
enforcement.
• Identify toxicology laboratories.
• Preserve evidence and maintain the chain of custody.
Promote training and develop jurisdictional policies. It is essential that examiners and other relevant
health care personnel, 911 dispatchers, law enforcement representatives, emergency medical technicians,
prosecutors, judges, and advocates receive training and information on alcohol and drug-facilitated sexual
assault. They need to be educated on the use of drugs and alcohol to facilitate sexual assault, screening for
alcohol- or drug-facilitated assault, and how to handle situations in which an alcohol- or drug-facilitated
sexual assault is suspected. Both agency-specific and multidisciplinary policies should be developed to guide
immediate response to a suspected alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault.240
First responders must recognize that although Rohypnol and gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) are widely
publicized as the “drugs of choice” in drug-facilitated sexual assault, assailants may use numerous other
substances (including alcohol) to facilitate sexual assault.241 They must understand the urgency of collecting
toxicology samples, if it is medically necessary, or if an alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual assault is
suspected, as well as the importance of obtaining informed consent from patients prior to sample collection.
They should also be aware that collection of toxicology samples is typically separate from the sexual assault
forensic evidence collection kit, and procedures for toxicology analysis may be different from that of other
evidence analysis.
Ideally, the first available urine sample should be collected in suspected alcohol- or drug-facilitated sexual
assault cases. Law enforcement agencies and emergency medical services should develop procedures and
staff training for collection in cases where patients must urinate before arriving at the exam site. Advocates
and other professionals who may have contact with patients prior to their arrival at the exam site should also
be educated to provide those who suspect that alcohol or drugs were used to facilitate the assault with
information on how to collect a sample if they cannot wait to urinate until they get to the site.
Plan response to voluntary use of drugs and/or alcohol by patients. It may be revealed during the exam
process or through toxicological analysis that patients voluntarily used drugs and/or alcohol shortly prior to
the assault.242 Voluntary drug and/or alcohol use by patients during this period should not diminish the
perceived seriousness of the assault. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors should guard against
disqualifying cases in which patients voluntarily used illegal drugs or used alcohol (whether legal or illegal
use). Patients should understand that information related to voluntary alcohol or drug use may be used to
undermine their credibility in court, but also that in some instances it might be helpful in prosecuting a case
by documenting their vulnerability (see the following section on explaining procedures). Also, before pursuing
240 These policies should clarify that patients should not be responsible for costs related to toxicology testing. Testing done as part of
forensic evidence collection is typically paid for by the involved government entity.
241 For more information about use of Rohypnol and GHB in drug-facilitated cases, see American Prosecutors Research Institute,
Violence Against Women Program, The Prosecution of Rohypnol and GHB Related Sexual Assaults, 1999.
242 Health care personnel involved in sexual assault cases should adhere to facility policy regarding 1) asking patients about alcohol and
drug use in the course of intake and treatment and 2) testing for alcohol and/or drugs if deemed medically necessary.
107charges related to illegal drug or alcohol use by patients, prosecutors should give great weight to the impact
that the threat of such charges may have on patients’ willingness to report the sexual assault and be involved
in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. Some jurisdictions have statutes protecting sexual assault
victims regarding drug and alcohol testing.243
It is important to document patient voluntary use of drugs and alcohol between the time of the assault and
the exam. Some patients may self-medicate to cope with post-assault trauma and require immediate medical
treatment. In addition, ingestion of drugs and/or alcohol during this period may affect the quality of evidence
and negatively impact patients’ ability to make informed decisions about treatment and evidence collection.
SART/SARRT members should have training on alcohol and substance abuse and how it is not uncommon
for victims to use drugs and alcohol to cope with past sexual assault experiences or trauma. It is important to
provide referrals and resources for victims who may reveal that they have a chemical dependency.
Be clear about the circumstances in which toxicology testing may be indicated.244 Routine toxicology
testing is not recommended. However, in any of the following situations, the collection of a urine and/or
blood sample may be indicated:245
• If a patient’s medical condition appears to warrant toxicology screening for optimal care (e.g., the
patient presents with drowsiness, fatigue, light-headedness, dizziness, psysiologic instability,
memory loss, impaired motor skills, or severe intoxication).
• If a patient or accompanying persons states the patient was or may have been drugged.
• If a patient suspects drug involvement because of a lack of recollection of event(s).246
Toxicology testing procedures should be explained to patients. Seek informed consent from patients to
collect toxicology samples. Patients should understand the following before agreeing to toxicology testing:247
• The purposes of toxicology testing and the scope of confidentiality of results.248
• The ability to detect and identify drugs and alcohol depends on collection of urine and/or blood within
a limited time period following ingestion.
• There is no guarantee that testing will reveal that drugs were used to facilitate the assault.
• Testing may or may not be limited to drugs commonly used to facilitate sexual assault249 and may
reveal other drugs or alcohol that patients may have ingested voluntarily.
• Whether any follow-up treatment is necessary if testing reveals the presence of drugs used to
facilitate sexual assault.250
243 See Cal. Pen. Code Section 13823.11 which states that testing to determine if alcohol or other drugs were associated with an
attempted or completed sexual assault as part of a forensic exam is not admissible against the victim in a civil or criminal proceeding
and provides other immunity and confidentiality safeguards.
244 There is some controversy related to if and when to collect toxicology samples and test patients for drug and/or alcohol use. Some
jurisdictions only collect these samples if drug-facilitated sexual assault is suspected or if a medical need arises. They seek to minimize
patients’ discomfort and avoid collecting unnecessary items. Other jurisdictions collect toxicology samples from every patient (with
permission) and analyze these samples as case facts and jurisdictional policy dictate. In addition to cases of suspected drug-facilitated
assault, some jurisdictions may request a toxicology sample if there is indication that patients voluntarily used drugs and/or alcohol prior
to the assault. One rationale for such a policy is that prosecutors will want all information on drug and alcohol use to prepare for the
case. When developing jurisdictional policy about when and if to collect toxicology samples, involved professionals should consider the
perspective of patients and the criminal justice system and make thoughtful, victim-centered decisions.
245 Bullets drawn from Connecticut’s Interim Sexual Assault Toxicology Screen Protocol, 2002.
246 Often, drugs used to facilitate sexual assault are mixed with alcohol and other beverages to further incapacitate patients, usually
without their knowledge. Once patients recover from the effects of drugs and/or alcohol, anterograde amnesia may make it difficult to
recall events. Consequently, patients may not be aware of the assault or even of how they were drugged. (Drawn from Connecticut’s
Interim Sexual Assault Toxicology Screen Protocol, 2002.)
247 List adapted partially from Connecticut’s Interim Sexual Assault Toxicology Screen Protocol, 2002.
248 If the patient authorizes the release of toxicology testing results to law enforcement and/or prosecution, this information will most
likely be discoverable by the defense. If toxicology testing is done for purely clinical purposes and results are documented only in the
patient’s medical records, the results are typically more difficult, but not impossible, for the defense to discover.
249 In some jurisdictions, examiners may be able to request testing for specific drugs used to facilitate sexual assault. In others, tests for
specific drugs are not done, rather, toxicology samples are screened for all ingested drugs and alcohol.
250 For example, patients with health conditions that may be affected by drug or alcohol intake may need information on possible impact
of involuntary drug/alcohol ingestion and what to do to identify, treat, or avoid potential problems.
108• Test results showing voluntary use of drugs and/or alcohol may be discoverable by the defense and
used to attempt to discredit patients or to question their ability to accurately perceive the events in
question (however, these results could also help substantiate that voluntary drug and/or alcohol use
sufficiently impaired patients’ consent and prevented legal consent).251
• Whether there is a local prosecution practice of charging sexual assault victims with a crime for
illegal voluntary drug and/or alcohol use revealed through toxicology screening.
• Declining testing when indicated by circumstances as described above may negatively impact the
investigation and/or prosecution.252
• When and how they can obtain information on the results from toxicology testing.
• Who will pay for toxicology testing.
• If toxicology testing can proceed without a report to law enforcement.
Care should be taken when providing the above information to patients. In particular, they may need to hear
repeatedly from examiners that voluntary use of drugs and/or alcohol, if any, does not reduce the
seriousness of the assault. Under no circumstances should the medical forensic exam and treatment be
conditioned upon patient consent to toxicology testing. Victims should be given access to the results of any
toxicology screening performed and should be given information on how to obtain a copy of the results.
Toxicology samples should be collected as soon as possible after a suspected drug-facilitated case
is identified and informed consent is obtained, even if patients are undecided about reporting to law
enforcement. The length of time that drugs used for drug-facilitated assault remain in urine or blood
depends on a number of variables (e.g., the type and amount of drug ingested, patients’ body size and rate
of metabolism, whether patients had a full stomach, and whether they previously urinated).253 Urine allows for
a longer window of detection of drugs commonly used in these cases than does blood.254 The sooner a urine
specimen is obtained after the assault, the greater the chances of detecting substances that are quickly
eliminated from the body.255
Immediately collect a urine sample when appropriate. If patients may have ingested a drug used for
facilitating sexual assault within 96 hours prior to the exam, a urine specimen of at least 30 milliliters but
preferably 100 milliliters (about 3 ounces) should be collected256 in a clean plastic or glass container (follow
jurisdictional policy). The urine sample does not have to be a clean catch (e.g., bacteria in the urine will not
compromise test results). If patients cannot wait to urinate until their arrival at the exam facility, first
responders should ask them to provide a sample and bring it to the facility, documenting the chain of
custody. It is suggested that law enforcement officers and emergency medical technicians keep specimen
cups readily available, according to agency policy.
Ideally, patients should not urinate until after evidence is collected. However, the number of times that
patients urinated prior to collection of the sample should be documented.
Collect a blood sample when appropriate. If ingestion of drugs used to facilitate sexual assault may have
occurred within 24 hours prior to the exam, a blood sample of at least 20 milliliters should be collected in a
gray-top tube (contains preservatives sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate257) according to jurisdictional
policy. A blood sample taken within this time period may pinpoint the time when drugs were ingested.258 If a
blood sample is collected for toxicology screening, it should be accompanied by a urine sample. If blood
alcohol determination is needed, collect blood within 24 hours of alcohol ingestion, according to jurisdictional
251 The prosecutor can work to minimize the possibility that information about voluntary alcohol and/or drug use will be used against
patients, particularly if patients are truthful from the start about their preassault drug/alcohol use and consent to testing.
252 For example, if there is a suspicion that the assault was drug-facilitated and there were no toxicology tests, investigators and
prosecutors may lack critical evidence, making it difficult to prosecute the case. Prosecutors might choose not to go forward with such a
case. Refusal to get tested may also be used by the defense to discredit the patient and question the validity of the charges.

109policy. (If blood has already been taken due to suspected drug ingestion, that sample can be used to
determine blood-alcohol level. An additional sample usually is not needed.)
Occasionally, patients of drug-facilitated sexual assault vomit. The analysis of the vomit may also be useful
to an investigation.259 Collect and preserve according to jurisdictional policy.
Package samples as appropriate. Package each toxicology sample according to the policy of the lab doing
the analysis, place in envelope, label, seal, and initial the seal.
Identify toxicology laboratories. Exam facility laboratories should not analyze toxicology samples in
suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault cases. Instead, involved criminal justice agencies should identify
forensic laboratories that can analyze these toxicology samples (they should have the capacity to detect
drugs in very small qualities).260 Information about these labs (e.g., contact information, evidence collection
and packaging procedures, and transfer procedures) should be provided to law enforcement representatives
investigating these cases, exam facilities, and examiner programs.
If toxicology tests are needed purely for the medical evaluation of patients, the exam facility lab typically
performs these tests. Lab results are recorded in patients’ medical records, according to facility policy. If
toxicology samples are needed for both clinical and forensic purposes, one sample can be collected for
immediate evaluation by the exam facility lab and another for analysis by the identified forensic lab. Take
samples at the same time to avoid more discomfort to patients than is necessary.
Preserve evidence and maintain the chain of custody. Involved health care personnel should be aware of
the toxicology lab’s requirements on collection, packaging, labeling, storage, handling, transportation, and
delivery of specimens.261 Policies should be in place for storage of these samples when patients are
undecided about reporting. As with any forensic evidence, the chain of custody must be maintained.
Refer to the current Forensic Toxicology Laboratory Guidelines by the Society of Forensic Toxicologists, Inc.,
and the American Academy of Forensic Sciences for detailed guidance on proper collection, labeling,
handling, submission, and analysis of toxicology samples.262

Urine should be refrigerated or frozen when stored.

1108. STI Evaluation and Care
Recommendations at a glance to facilitate evaluation and treatment of STIs:
• Offer patients information in a language they understand.
• Consider the need for STI testing on an individual basis.
• Encourage patients to accept prophylaxis against STIs if indicated.
• Encourage follow-up STI exams, testing, immunizations, counseling, and treatment as directed.
• Address concerns about HIV infection.
Contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI), also commonly known as a sexually transmitted disease or
STD, from assailants is typically a significant concern of sexual assault patients. Because of this concern, it
should be addressed as part of the medical forensic exam. Mechanisms should be in place in any setting
where these patients are examined for STIs to ensure continuity of care (including timely review of test
results) and monitor compliance with and adverse reactions to any therapeutic or prophylactic regimens.263
Offer patients information in a language they understand. Include information about the risks of STIs,
symptoms and the need for immediate examination if symptoms occur, testing and treatment options (and
the need for abstinence from sexual intercourse until treatment is completed), follow-up care, and referrals
as needed.264 Referrals should include free and low-cost testing, counseling, and treatment offered in various
sections of the community. Patients should be aware of the scope of confidentiality related to information in
their medical records related to STIs.265 The level of detail needed when providing this information verbally
varies (e.g., some patients may be aware of risks and want treatment, while others may not be as
knowledgeable of risks or their options).
Consider the need for STI testing on an individual basis. Testing at the time of the initial exam does not
typically have forensic value if patients are sexually active and an STI could have been acquired prior to the
assault. Also, despite rape shield laws, there may be a concern that positive test results could be used
against patients (e.g., to suggest sexual promiscuity). There may, however, be situations in which testing has
legal purposes, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was an element
of the crime. Or, for nonsexually active patients, a baseline negative test followed by an STI could be used
as evidence, if the suspect also had an STI.
Trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis (BV), gonorrhea, and chlamydial infection are the most frequently
diagnosed infections among sexually assaulted women.266 Their presence does not necessarily indicate
acquisition during the assault, since these infections exist among some sexually active women.267 The
medical forensic exam presents an opportunity to identify preexisting STIs, regardless of when they were
acquired, and for examiners to make recommendations for specific treatment. Testing for STIs at the time of
the exam also gives examiners and patients the option of deferring treatment until it is needed.
Seek the informed consent of patients for testing, if indicated, following CDC guidelines. (For more
information on this topic, see A.3. Informed Consent.)
263 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, December 17, 2010, 9(RR-12), p. 91. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/STD/treatment/ (CDC general phone: 800–311–
3435). Much of the information in this chapter was drawn from these guidelines. Note that the guidelines are updated periodically. In
addition to the guidelines, the CDC Web site at http://www.cdc.gov offers information on related research, news, and Internet links.
264 Drawn partially from Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 92.
265 Laws in all states limit the evidentiary use of a patient’s prior sexual history, including evidence of previously acquired STIs, as part of
an effort to undermine the credibility of a patient’s testimony. Evidentiary privilege against revealing any aspect of the exam or treatment
is enforced in most states. In unanticipated, exceptional situations, however, STI diagnoses may later be accessed. (Sexually
Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 90.)
266 Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection. In addition,
post-assault testing can detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Sexually Transmitted
Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 91).
267 The prevalence and incidence of STIs vary across societies and subpopulations defined by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and
socioeconomic status (Fenton, Johnson, and Nicoll 1997)
111Encourage patients to accept prophylaxis against STIs if indicated. If prophylaxis is accepted at the
time of the exam, testing is usually not indicated medically. Routine preventive therapy after a sexual assault
is often recommended because follow-up with these patients can be difficult.268 It also may reduce the need
for more expensive/extensive treatment if an STI is discovered at a later time. Meet or exceed current CDC
guidelines for STI preventive therapy for your geographic area.269 (The CDC suggests a regimen to protect
against chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomonas, and BV, as well as the hepatitis B virus.) If prophylaxis is
declined at the time of the initial exam, it is medically prudent to obtain cultures and arrange for a follow-up
examination and testing (it is recommended that all patients are reexamined—see the section on follow-up
activities). Document patients’ decisions and rationales for declining prophylaxis in their medical records.270
If patients’ clinical presentation suggests a preexisting ascending STI, such as fever, abdominal or pelvic
pain, and/or vaginal discharge, they should be evaluated and treated for the ascending infection. This
treatment should be based on specific treatment options for sexually transmitted infections in the local
community.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). See CDC recommendations related to HBV
diagnosis, treatment, prevention, postexposure immunizations, prevaccination antibody screening,
postexposure prophylaxis, and special considerations.271 Patients who have completed a full hepatitis B
vaccination regimen prior to the assault are protected from HBV infection and do not need further doses.
(See the CDC recommended regimen for adolescents and adults.) For those who were not fully vaccinated
prior to the assault, the vaccine should be completed as scheduled. Patients unvaccinated prior to the
assault or unsure of whether they have been vaccinated should receive active postexposure prophylaxis
(e.g., hepatitis B vaccine alone) upon the initial clinical evaluation. Follow-up doses should be given 1 to 2
and 4 to 6 months after the first dose. Unless suspects are known to have acute hepatitis B, HBIG (hepatitis
B immune globulin) is not required. (When HBIG is needed, use CDC recommended doses.)
Examiners must stress to patients receiving the HBV vaccine the importance of following up for
administration of doses as scheduled for full protection. Advocates should also be educated about the
possibility of patients receiving prophylaxis against HBV and encourage those who start the vaccine regimen
to follow up for required additional doses.
Obtain informed consent from patients for treatment. (For information on this topic, see A.3. Informed
Consent.) Patients should be aware of the benefits and toxicity associated with recommended regimens.
Encourage follow-up STI exams, testing, immunizations, counseling, and treatment as directed.272
Although patients may be reluctant to go for follow-up exams for STIs, such exams are essential because
they provide an opportunity to detect new infections acquired during or after the assault, complete hepatitis B
immunization, if indicated, and complete counseling and treatment for other STIs. Examinations for STIs for
all patients should be repeated according to exam facility policy—the CDC recommends a follow-up
appointment within 1 to 2 weeks of the assault. If patients tested negative at the time of the medical forensic
exam and chose not to receive prophylaxis, follow-up testing should be conducted.273 The CDC recommends
that in this case the follow-up exam be done within a week to ensure that positive test results are discussed
promptly with patients and treatment is offered. The CDC recommends follow-up testing for patients who
received treatment only if they report having symptoms consistent with an STI. (However, patients who were
treated should be informed of the option of follow-up testing to confirm the presence or lack of infection.) The
CDC recommends that testing for syphilis and HIV infection should be repeated 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6
months after the assault if initial test results were negative and if these infections are likely to be present in
assailants (see the upcoming section on evaluating risk for exposure to HIV).
268 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 91.
269 Antibiotic prophylaxes are updated periodically and are usually tailored to specific regions (because, for example, one part of the
country may be resistant to a certain antibiotic).
270 Nonphysician examiners providing STI prophylaxis typically must operate within the boundaries of a protocol and have access to
medical supervision, consultation, and review.

273 Infectious agents acquired through the assault may not have produced sufficient concentrations of organisms to result in positive test
results at the medical forensic exam. (Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 91.)
112It is important that follow-up communication with patients (particularly by examiners and advocates) include a
reminder to go to follow-up exams and receive STI-related testing, immunizations, and treatment as directed.
Advocates and health care personnel may be able to assist patients in making follow-up appointments,
obtaining transportation to and from appointments, and determining how to pay for expenses involved with
follow-up testing and care. Some jurisdictions may cover follow-up treatment as part of initial care through
funds such as crime victims’ compensation. In such instances, patients may be more apt to seek follow-up
treatment. Advocates may also be able to accompany patients to these follow-up appointments.
Address concerns about HIV infection. Although the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection274 from a sexual assault appears to be low,275 it is typically of grave concern for sexual assault
patients.
Provide information and referrals.276 Examiners should talk with patients about their concerns regarding the
possibility of contracting HIV.277 Although a definitive statement of benefit cannot be made regarding Post
Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) after sexual assault, the possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should be
assessed at the time of the examination. The possible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection should also
be discussed with the patient if the details of the assault pose an elevated risk for HIV exposure. These
particular factors may include: the likelihood that the assailant has HIV, the time elapsed since the event, the
exposure characteristics, and local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. A specialist consultation on PEP regimens is
recommended if HIV exposure during the assault was possible and PEP is being considered. The sooner
PEP is initiated after exposure, the higher the likelihood it will prevent HIV transmission if exposure occurred.
The CDC recommends offering the patient a 3-5 day supply of PEP if the medication is judged to be
necessary and the patient decides to utilize the treatment.278
As with other STIs, offer patients information about HIV risks, symptoms and the need for immediate
examination if symptoms occur, testing and treatment options, and the need for abstinence or barrier use
(condoms) during sexual intercourse until any treatment received is completed. Include local referrals for
testing/counseling and comprehensive HIV services in the community and region. This information can help
patients make decisions about testing and treatment based on facts rather than fear.279
Discuss testing options. Baseline HIV testing is not typically an exam component. However, if the assault is
considered a high risk for HIV exposure, patients should establish their baseline HIV status within 72 hours
after the assault and then be tested periodically as directed by health care personnel. However, even if the
assault is not considered a high risk for HIV exposure, some patients may still wish to be tested.
HIV testing should be done in settings where counseling can be offered to explain results and implications.
When providing testing referrals, let patients know whether testing services are free, anonymous, and/or
confidential.280 Confidential and anonymous testing is recommended.
Assess the need to offer HIV postexposure prophylaxis.281 In certain circumstances, the likelihood of HIV
transmission may be reduced by postexposure therapy for HIV with antiretroviral agents. Postexposure
274 HIV refers to any of a group of retroviruses that infect and destroy helper T-cells of the immune system. AIDS (acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome) can be triggered by infection with HIV. (Drawn from Arkansas’ Sexual Assault: A Hospital/Community
Protocol for Forensic and Medical Examination, 2001, p. B2.)
275 Although HIV-antibody seroconversion has been reported among individuals whose only known risk factor was sexual assault or
sexual abuse, the risk for acquiring HIV infection through a single episode of sexual assault is likely low. The overall probability of HIV
transmission during a single act of intercourse from a suspect known to be HIV-infected depends on many factors. In specific
circumstances, the probability of transmission could be high. These factors may include the type of sexual intercourse (oral, vaginal, or
anal), presence of oral, vaginal, or anal trauma (including bleeding), site of exposure to ejaculate, viral load in ejaculate, and presence of
a STI or genital lesions in assailants or patients. (Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, p. 92.)

available through aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/ or by calling the CDC’s HIV/AIDS Information Hotline (see below footnote).
277 Some states statutes provide for mandatory HIV testing of suspected sex offenders upon arrest and/or conviction. Patients should be
advised of the availability of such testing.

113therapy with zidovudine has been associated with a reduced risk for HIV infection and has become the
standard of care for health workers who have percutaneous (e.g., needle stick) exposure to HIV, but whether
these findings can be extrapolated to other exposure situations, including sexual assault, is unknown.
The use of antiretroviral agents after possible exposure through sexual assault must balance potential
benefits of treatment with its possible adverse side effects.282 Health care personnel must evaluate patients’
risk of exposure to HIV and consider whether to offer treatment based on their perceived risk. Examiners
unfamiliar with known risks associated with exposure or side effects of postexposure therapeutic agents
should consult with a specialist in HIV treatment. Numerous factors may influence the decision to offer
treatment, such as the time since the exposure occurred; the probability that the assailant is infected with
HIV; the likelihood that transmission could occur from the assault; and the prevalence of HIV in the
geographic area or institutional setting (e.g., a prison) where the assault occurred.283
Offer postexposure prophylaxis for HIV to patients at high risk for exposure, particularly when it is known that
suspects have HIV/AIDS. If offered, the following information should be discussed with patients:284
• The unknown efficacy of postexposure prophylaxis for HIV in cases of sexual assault.
• The known side effects and toxicity of antiretroviral medications.
• The need for frequent dosing of medication and the follow-up care necessary.
• The importance of compliance with the recommended therapy.
• The necessity for immediate initiation of treatment for maximum effectiveness.
• The estimated costs of the medication and monitoring.285
When given following a sexual assault, postexposure prophylaxis is the same as for occupational exposure
to HIV. Refer to CDC recommendations for postexposure antiretroviral therapy286 and consult with an HIV
specialist where possible. Careful monitoring and follow-up by a health care provider or agency experienced
in HIV issues is required. Patients should be alerted to symptoms of primary HIV infection (e.g., fever,
fatigue, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and rash) and seek care if these symptoms arise.
Seek informed consent of patients to administer treatment. The decision to begin or withhold treatment
should be made by patients and health care personnel after patients have been adequately informed of the
risks and benefits of treatment options. (For information on this topic, see A.3. Informed Consent.)

1149. Pregnancy Risk Evaluation and Care
Recommendations at a glance to evaluate and treat pregnancy:
• Discuss the probability of pregnancy with patients with reproductive capability.
• Administer a pregnancy test for all patients with reproductive capability (with their consent).
• Discuss treatment options with patients in their preferred language.
• A victim of sexual assault should be offered prophylaxis for pregnancy, subject to informed consent and
consistent with current treatment guidelines. Conscience statutes will continue to protect health care
providers who have moral or religious objections to providing certain forms of contraception. In a case in
which a provider refuses to offer certain forms of contraception for moral or religious reasons, victims of
sexual assault must receive information on how to access these services in a timely fashion.
Becoming pregnant from a sexual assault is a significant concern of sexual assault patients, and patients of
different ages, social, cultural, and religious/spiritual backgrounds may have varying feelings regarding
acceptable treatment options. Most programs offer pregnancy prevention or interception for sexual assault
patients if they are seen within 120 hours of the assault. Examiners and other involved health care
personnel must be careful not to influence patients’ choices of treatment.
Discuss the probability of pregnancy with patients with reproductive capability. The risk of pregnancy
from sexual assault is estimated to be 2 to 5 percent, similar to the risk of pregnancy from a one-time sexual
encounter. The 2005 National Crime Victimization Study 287 reported 64,080 female victims of rape;
therefore, statistically speaking, up to 3,204 pregnancies could have resulted from the rapes. Any female of
reproductive capability (Tanner Stage 3 and above, irrespective of menarche) can potentially become
pregnant from any single exposure. Determination of the probability of conception also depends upon other
variables, for example, the use of contraceptives, regularity of the menstrual cycle, fertility of the victim and
the perpetrator, time in the cycle of exposure, and whether the perpetrator ejaculated intravaginally.
Pregnancy resulting from sexual assault often is a cause of great concern and significant additional trauma
to the victim, so victims’ fears should be taken seriously.288 Although many transgender male individuals
believe they are infertile as a result of using testosterone, cases have been reported of unexpected
pregnancies. Therefore, if a transgender male individual has not had a hysterectomy, is still within
childbearing years, and the nature of the assault suggests it, the possibility of pregnancy should be
discussed, even if he has not been menstruating.
Administer a pregnancy test for all patients with reproductive capability (with their consent).289 An
exception is if a patient clearly is pregnant. If a patient is pregnant, the pregnancy may affect what
medications can be administered or prescribed in the course of or after the exam. Follow policies of the
medical facility for pregnancy testing. Sensitive beta-HCG pregnancy tests can be utilized. Most
commercially available urine pregnancy tests are sensitive to about 50 milli-international units/ml and will
detect pregnancy 8 to 9 days after conception, before a menstrual period is missed. Blood pregnancy tests
will detect HCG at very low levels. If the pregnancy test is positive, emergency contraception is
contraindicated and decisions about other medications (e.g., STI prophylaxis) must be made in consideration
of the pregnancy. If the test is negative and the patient has had unprotected intercourse within the last 10
days and would continue that pregnancy if conception has occurred, then she may be considered to be
pregnant and emergency contraception would not be administered.
Discuss treatment options with patients in their preferred language, including emergency
contraception.290 In cases of sexual assault, pregnancy is often an overwhelming and genuine fear.
Therefore, discuss treatment options with patients, including emergency contraception. An immediate option

289 Preexisting pregnancy may raise patient privacy issues. If the case is prosecuted, the prosecutor should work to address concerns
such as this one.
290 The National Sexual Violence Resource Center (877–739–3895 or 717–909–0710) offers more detailed information about sexual
assault and pregnancy on their Web site at http://www.nsvrc.org/.
115is to offer hormone therapy (emergency contraception pills or EC).291 Another option is to forgo immediate
treatment and have the patient follow-up with their primary care provider. Discuss options with the patient
and information regarding the timeframe for emergency contraception provision, so she can make an
informed decision. Inform the patient that the provision of any emergency contraception will not prevent
sexually transmitted infections. The conversation with the patient should include a thorough discussion,
including mechanism of action for each treatment option, side effects, dosing, and follow-up. This
information should also be provided in writing in the preferred language of the patient, if possible.
A victim of sexual assault should be offered prophylaxis for pregnancy, subject to informed consent
and consistent with current treatment guidelines. Conscience statutes will continue to protect health
care providers who have moral or religious objections to providing certain forms of contraception. In a case
in which a provider refuses to offer certain forms of contraception for moral or religious reasons, victims of
sexual assault must receive information on how to access these services in a timely fashion.
Offer/provide the patient with emergency contraception pills and anti-nausea medication if they are at risk,
according to facility policy.292 Emergency contraception is a hormonal method of preventing pregnancy that
can be used after sexual assault. There are multiple products available for EC. It is recommended, however,
that levonorgestrel,293 a synthetic hormone,294 be used.295 This option is recommended for its higher efficacy
rate and ease of dosing, and the fewest number of side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting.296
Levonorgestrel will not end a pregnancy that is already in progress and is considered a safe and easy
treatment for victims of assault in preventing a pregnancy. Levonorgestrel is most effective if used within
297
120 hours and can reduce the risk of pregnancy by up to 89 percent. Traditional dosing of levonorgestrel
includes administering two doses of 0.75 mg taken orally 12 hours apart. However, some studies indicate
that single dosing with 1.5 mgs of levonorgestral are just as effective and better tolerated by the patient.298
Follow-up Care: The patient should be informed that following the use of EC, there may be a heavier or
lighter menses than usual and the menses onset may not occur at the expected time. If no bleeding has
occurred within three weeks, the patient should be reevaluated and a repeat pregnancy test performed. The
patient must be advised not to have unprotected intercourse until after the menses has occurred, or the
repeat pregnancy test is negative.
If the facility chooses not to provide EC on site, the patient should be given prescriptions for EC and
antinausea medications, with a list of pharmacies that stock the medication. 299
If the facility is not willing to provide EC or write the needed prescriptions, it is recommended that the patient
be given local referrals to medical facilities that can immediately assist with alternative treatment.
If no referral is available, provide the patient with the following phone numbers: 1-888-not2late or the online
reference: http://not-2-late.com.300
291 Copper Bearing Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs) may also be an option, however, they are much less recommended because of the risk
of infection in certain cases, the potentially painful insertion procedure, and the need for follow-up care.

11610. Discharge and Follow-up
Recommendations at a glance to facilitate discharge planning and follow-up with patients:
• Address issues related to medical discharge and follow-up care.
• Advocates, law enforcement representatives, and other involved responders can coordinate with health
care providers to discuss a range of other issues with patients prior to discharge.
Health care personnel have important tasks to accomplish prior to discharging patients, as do advocates and
law enforcement representatives (if involved). These responders should coordinate their activities as much
as possible to reduce repetition and avoid further overwhelming patients.
Address issues related to medical discharge and follow-up care. Health care personnel (preferably
examiners) should address the following issues with patients prior to discharge:
Make sure patients’ medical and mental health needs related to the assault have been addressed. Discuss
with patients whether they have any other medical and/or mental health concerns related to the assault. 301 If
injuries or trauma have not been treated yet, examiners should refer patients to exam facility clinicians (e.g.,
hospital emergency department staff) for care or provide the appropriate community referrals prior to
discharge.
Provide patients with oral and written medical discharge instructions. Include a summary of the exam (e.g.,
evidence collected, tests conducted, medication prescribed or provided, information provided, and treatment
received), medication doses to be taken, follow-up appointments needed or scheduled, and referrals. The
discharge form could also include contact information and hours of operation for local advocacy programs.
Arrange follow-up appointments for patients. Follow-up may be indicated to document developing or healing
injuries (for example, bruising) and complete resolution of healing. Forensic follow-up may also be indicated
to further evaluate nonspecific findings (such as redness, swelling, or cervical abnormalities) that may be
related to acute trauma or may be normal variants. (A jurisdictional policy describing the indications and
procedures for follow-up for documentation purposes should be in place.) Appointments may also be needed
to address ongoing medical concerns. If appointments are not scheduled, at least indicate to patients which
appointments are needed and if sites are different than the initial exam. Make it clear that patients do not
have to disclose the assault to receive follow-up medical care. Follow-up appointments may include:302
• For patients with evidence of acute trauma: A short-term follow-up appointment to reexamine and
document the development of visible findings and photograph areas of injury; and an exam 2 to 4
weeks later to document resolution of findings or healing of injuries.
• For all patients: Repeat exams for STIs according to facility policy (see C.8. STI Evaluation and
Care).
• Primary health care providers or other nonacute care providers can provide longer term care as
needed (e.g., for HIV testing, STI testing, and administering doses of Hepatitis B vaccine).
Discuss follow-up medical contact procedures. Discuss with patients whether they would like health care
providers to provide a follow-up call and, if so, the best method and time for this contact (maintaining
patients’ privacy and safety). The main purposes of such a call are to check on medical status and remind
patients about the necessity of follow-up testing and care. An optimal time for a first medical follow-up
contact is 24 to 48 hours following discharge. Personnel following up with patients should be familiar with the
case, confidentiality issues, and potential medical needs.303
301 Care should be taken to ensure that mental health professionals can appropriately and respectfully handle patients from minority
and/or stigmatized groups such as specific cultural groups or transgender individuals.
302 Bullets drawn partially from the California Medical Protocol for Examination of Sexual Assault and Child Sexual Abuse Victims, 2001,
p. 98.
303 When appropriate, advocates may assist health care personnel in encouraging patients to seek the follow-up medical care they need.
They also may encourage patients to discuss with health care providers their concerns about initial and follow-up medical care.
117Advocates, law enforcement representatives, and other involved responders can coordinate with
health care providers to discuss a range of other issues with patients prior to discharge. Involved
responders should come to agreement about who is responsible for each step below and where coordination
is necessary. For example, while advocates usually explain advocacy services and law enforcement
representatives explain the investigative process, each responder may have a role in helping patients plan
for their safety and well-being. If health care personnel are the only responders involved, however, they may
need to provide patients with much of the information below.
After the exam is finished, address patients’ physical comfort needs. (For a discussion of this topic, see A.2.
Victim-Centered Care.)
Help patients plan for their safety and well-being. Jurisdictional and exam site policies should be in place to
facilitate this process. Assist patients in developing a postexam plan that addresses their physical safety and
emotional well-being. Screen for domestic and dating violence and others forms of abuse. Assist patients in
considering things such as:
• Where are they going after being discharged? With whom? Will these individuals provide them with
adequate support? Is there anyone else they would like to contact? (Provide information about
available community resources for obtaining support and help in making the contact if needed.)
• Will their living arrangements expose them to the threat of continued violence or harassment? Is
there a need for emergency shelter or alternative housing options? (Provide options and help obtain
if needed.)
• Are they eligible for protection orders? (Provide information and help obtain if desired.)
• Is there a need for enhanced security measures? (Discuss options and help obtain if desired.)
• If they feel unsafe, what will they do to get help? (Discuss options and help them develop a plan.)
Planning must take into account the needs and concerns of specific populations. For example, if patients
with physical disabilities require shelter, the shelter must be accessible and staff able to meet their needs for
personal assistance with activities of daily living.304 If patients living in institutional settings have been
assaulted by another resident, a staff person, or person who has easy access to residents, the institution
should offer alternative living arrangements and reduce the likelihood that patients have to come into contact
with the assailant again. It should also ensure them access to services designed to promote their recovery.
Explain follow-up contact procedures of all responders involved. Coordinate follow-up contact of involved
agencies as much as possible, keeping the number of responders contacting patients to a minimum. Explain
if contact procedures are different for patients with limited English proficiency or specific communities or
institutions (e.g., schools, military bases, prisons, or residential programs may have their own procedures).
Consider offering patients prepaid phone cards they can use to call a contact person with concerns or
questions.
Explain advocacy and counseling services. Sexual assault advocacy programs typically offer a host of
services for victims and their significant others, in addition to those provided during the exam process. (For
more information on services, see A.2.Victim-Centered Care.) Advocates can describe and offer patients,
their family members, and friends these services, as well as explain options for counseling in the jurisdiction
and offer referrals. Some advocacy programs provide professional mental health counseling, but many refer
patients to community or private agencies. Before being discharged, advocates should ask patients if they
can follow up with them. If they agree, they can determine optimal methods and times for the contacts.
During follow-up contacts, advocates can help patients reassess their safety; offer support and crisis
counseling; answer their questions and provide additional referrals and information; and help coordinate
other advocacy services and counseling based upon identified needs.
Explain the investigative process. If law enforcement is involved, inform patients that investigators will
request an interview with them, if not already done, explain the criminal justice process and victims’ rights,
reassess their safety and provide assistance as warranted, and then recontact them as needed as their case
304 Drawn from M. Nosek and C. Howland, Abuse and Women with Disabilities, 1998, p. 3.
118progresses.305 Explain if contact procedures are different for patients with limited English proficiency or for
specific communities or institutions. Patients should receive contact information of involved law enforcement
representatives and agencies and a case report number. They should feel free to call their investigator with
any new relevant information, if new signs of injuries appear, about suspects’ compliance with protection
orders or bond conditions, if suspects try to contact them, or with other related questions or concerns. They
should be aware that they will be contacted by the prosecution office if their case goes forward. (Patients
should be aware that it is their decision whether to report their case and talk with law enforcement officials
and prosecutors.)
If evidence has been gathered and law enforcement is involved, the law enforcement representative can
discuss with patients the possibility of a match being found through DNA analysis or of other victims of the
same assailant being identified. Ask patients if they want to be contacted by law enforcement in these
situations and, if so, determine the best contact method.
For patients who have not made a report and when law enforcement is not involved, patients should be given
information on who to contact and how if they decide that they do want to make a report. They should also
be given information on where the kit will be stored and how it will be tracked (for example if there is a
tracking number, it should be provided).
Provide information. Offer patients clear and concise information, both orally and in writing.306 Information
should be tailored to patients’ communication skill level/modality and language. (For more information on the
types of information that patients might find useful, see A.2. Victim-Centered Care.)
305 Some patients may want information, either during the exam process or after, about the amount of time it takes to process cases in
the criminal justice system. It can be helpful for them to know the range of time it typically takes in that jurisdiction for evidence to be
analyzed and for cases to be forwarded to prosecution or tried in court. This information may help them prepare for their justice system
involvement. At the same time, they must understand that every case is different and typical time estimates from the past may not apply.
306 Many local sexual assault advocacy programs and state coalitions of sexual assault programs offer publications that speak to victims’
concerns in the aftermath of an assault. However, any involved agency, SART, or coordinating council could develop such literature.
11912011. Examiner Court Appearances
Recommendations at a glance for jurisdictions to maximize the usefulness of examiner testimony:
• Encourage broad education for examiners on testifying in court.
• Promote prompt notification of examiners if there is a need for them to testify in court.
• Encourage pretrial preparation of examiners.
• Encourage examiners to seek feedback on their testimony to improve effectiveness of future court
appearances.
It should be expected that examiners will be called on to testify in court as either fact and/or expert
witnesses,307 even though in some cases, a plea bargain may be agreed upon, or the prosecuting attorney
may decide not to try the case. Examiners should always conduct and document each examination knowing
that legal testimony may ultimately be required.
Encourage broad education for examiners on testifying in court:308
• Provide them with information about courtroom proceeding basics (e.g., criminal justice process and
terms, who typically is present,309 and prosecution and defense strategies).
• Educate them about different types of testimony (including what can and cannot be said during
testimony). This information should assist examiners in explaining to patients during the exam their
potential role as a witness should the case be prosecuted.
• Help them understand that testifying in court can be a difficult experience. In almost every case that is
litigated, cross-examination after initial testimony will occur. Cross-examination is a part of our
constitutional framework, but as defense counsel represent alleged offenders, their questions may be
perceived by examiners as intimidating and hostile. It is critical that examiners are prepared to effectively
handle such situations and have a support system in place to help them prepare for and deal with related
stress they may experience.
• Provide them with pretrial preparation (see the section below on this topic).
Involve trainers from health care, prosecution, and the judiciary in trainings on court testimony. Also, include
defense attorneys who can educate examiners on defense perspectives. In addition to attending trainings,
examiners should stay abreast of cutting-edge practices and related case law (e.g., rulings that impact the
scope of issues they can testify on in court).310
307 An expert witness is person who has training, education, and experience on a particular subject and who is formally found to be
qualified as an expert by a judge. Expert witnesses may give opinions in court on matters in which their expertise is relevant. Nonexpert
witnesses normally cannot give opinions in response to questions in court, but can only testify to the facts (what has been observed,
collected, or heard). (Drawn from San Diego County’s SART Standards of Practice, 2001, p. 40.)
308 This section is partially adapted from the International Association of Forensic Nurses, SANE Education Guidelines, 1999. One useful
resource for SANEs and attorneys who utilize SANEs for testimony is L. Ledray and L. Barry, Sexual Assault Clinical Issues: SANE
Expert and Factual Testimony, Journal of Emergency Nursing, 24(3), June 1998, pp. 284–287.
309 The following may be present in the courtroom: the judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, jury, bailiff, clerk, court reporter, law
enforcement investigator, victim, defendant, and victim advocate.
310 This section focuses on preparing examiners for court testimony. Beyond preparing examiners, it is critical to encourage training for
attorneys who try these cases on how to properly interpret and use the medical forensic examination. In addition, they need an accurate
understanding about the education and clinical preparation, roles, and responsibilities of the forensic examiner. Like examiners, they
can benefit from participating in mock trials and need ongoing education to stay abreast of the latest best practices and related case
law. Prosecutors should be aware of and share related case law and protocol guides with judges as references to qualify examiners as
expert witnesses. They can also share questions they plan to ask to establish credentials of these witnesses. Additionally, prosecutors
must understand how to educate the jury about evidence that will be presented (e.g., a lack of physical injury does not equal lack of
sexual assault). Similarly, it is important to encourage judicial education on issues related to examiner testimony. Judges may not
understand all that occurs during the exam process or the full extent of examiner expertise. Understanding Sexual Violence: Prosecuting
Adult Rape and Sexual Assault Cases, Video Library I: Presenting Medical Evidence in an Adult Rape Trial, 2002, is a useful resource
for prosecutors and judges (for more information, see http://www.legalmomentum.org/our-work/njep/njep-sexual-assault.html). The
National Judicial Education Program (NJEP) offers this resource. It also offers a judicial curriculum on sexual assault trials.
121Promote prompt notification of examiners if there is a need for them to testify in court. Examiners
should be informed well in advance of a trial if they are being called as witnesses. It may be helpful for
attorneys calling them (both prosecutors and defense attorneys) to first develop relationships with
coordinators of examiner programs, if they exist, or staff that oversee examiners at the exam site. In some
facilities, they may need to reach out to risk management departments, which oversee all potential areas of
liability for the facility. The first time an attorney contacts the witness should not be through a subpoena.
Unexpected subpoenas can cause examiners a great deal of anxiety.311
Attorneys should regard examiners they call as witnesses with respect for the knowledge and expertise
examiners offer to the court. They also should work to minimize the amount of time examiners wait to testify,
allowing them to return to their work as quickly as possible. Judges also should be aware of the need to give
examiners priority in the scheduling of testimony.
Encourage pretrial preparation of examiners.312 Examiners should be prepared for both direct examination
and cross examination. When preparing to testify, the following suggestions may be useful to examiners:
• Although the criminal justice record includes the medical forensic report, photographs, and the
results of evidence analysis, medical records are confidential in most jurisdictions. Before examiners
or other involved health care providers can talk with an attorney about information in patients’
medical records, those records must be successfully subpoenaed. Health care facilities and/or
independent examiner programs typically have procedures in place for handling subpoenas.313
• It is critical that examiners meet in advance with the attorney(s) calling them as witnesses, in order to
prepare for testimony in individual cases. Not only should they review and discuss the initial
examination of the patient, but also any subsequent contacts between the patient and the examiner.
• Prior to testifying, examiners should review records of the exam and keep a log of materials
reviewed.
• Expert witnesses should be prepared to educate the court, particularly jurors. They should consider
terminology and descriptions that will most clearly advise lay persons in the courtroom.
• Examiners should keep in mind that anything they write about the case is potentially discoverable.
• Examiners should be prepared to prove qualifications and ready to discuss educational background,
clinical experience, and prior experience as expert witnesses. They may also need to explain
qualifications if they are testifying to facts in a case. They should keep a portfolio that lists education,
experience, and previous appearances as a witness.314
• Examiners should understand that they may not testify as to whether patients consented to sexual
contact; that is for the jury to decide. However, some jurisdictions allow expert testimony that speaks
to the consistency between patients’ statements and injuries rather than attempting to draw
conclusions about how injuries were caused or whether a sexual assault occurred.315
During testimony, examiners should consider the following:
• The role of the examiner in court is to educate judges and juries.
• Business attire is appropriate for court appearances. Limit excessive jewelry and other accessories
which can be distracting.
• Be sincere, polite, and appear in control. Being nervous is normal, even for examiners who have
testified previously. Make eye contact with those doing the questioning as well as with the jury.
• Listen to the questions carefully. Allow time to compose answers before speaking. Be concise and
correct in responses. Avoid terms such as “I believe” or “I think.”

122• Avoid medical jargon to the extent possible. If it is needed, define its usage.
• Answer only questions that are asked. Ask the questioning attorney for clarification or to restate the
question if needed.
• If the answer to a question is not known, say so. There is no reason for examiners to explain why
they do not know the answer. They can ask to refer to records if their memories need refreshing.
• Let the attorney guide the questioning. Answer only questions that are asked. Ask the questioning
attorney for clarification or to restate the question if needed. Do not elaborate unless the attorney or
judge asks for more information.
• If it is realized that an error or omission occurred in testimony, acknowledge it politely.
Although it is most likely that examiners will be called by the prosecution, they may also be called by the
defense. In either case, examiners are expected to give objective testimony. In addition to the previous tips,
examiners should consider the following:
• Seek guidance from the prosecutor regarding appropriate interaction with the defense attorney prior
to testimony.
• When disagreeing with the questioning attorney, do so without argument or interruption.
• Be aware of the phrasing of questions by the cross-examining attorney that may be designed to
place doubt on examiner testimony. For instance, if a compound question is asked, the answer to
one part may be “yes” and to the other part may be “no.” Be sure to divide answers as appropriate.
• If the questions of the cross-examining attorney include incorrect interpretation of previous examiner
testimony or documentation, the erroneous information should be corrected.
• Be careful to provide consistent answers, especially if cross-examining attorneys ask the same
question several times, using different wording.
Encourage examiners to seek feedback on their courtroom testimony to improve the effectiveness of
future court appearances. For example, after the legal proceedings have been completed, examiners may
wish to meet with prosecutors for feedback and evaluation of their testimony. Examiners might also want to
observe other experts testify in these cases.

128Appendix A. Developing Customized Protocols:
Considerations for Jurisdictions
Jurisdictions starting from scratch in developing their own exam protocols are encouraged to consider the
recommendations in this national protocol in their entirety and tailor them to fit local needs, challenges,
statutes, and policies. Jurisdictions that have existing protocols can consider whether any of the protocol
recommendations or the tasks below could serve to improve their immediate response to sexual assault or
address gaps in services or interventions.
Form a protocol planning team. At the least, this team should include those responders involved in the exam
process, including health care personnel, exam facility administrators, law enforcement representatives,
victim advocates, prosecutors, and forensic laboratory personnel. Organizations serving specific populations
in the community should also be involved at some level to make sure the protocol speaks to the needs of
victims of diverse backgrounds. Team participants should have authority to make policy decisions on behalf
of their agencies. Bringing together such a team can be challenging, particularly in jurisdictions with multiple
sexual assault victim advocacy programs, exam facilities, law enforcement agencies, prosecution offices,
and court systems (or where several levels of government may be involved in investigation and prosecution
of sexual assault cases). Although representation from all involved disciplines and agencies is encouraged,
at some point the team assembled will have to move ahead with planning efforts. Try to keep those absent
informed of team activities and offer them opportunities to provide feedback on protocol development and
revision.
Assess needs.316 Before initiating policy changes, it is important that the planning team assess the
jurisdiction’s current response to sexual assault, with a focus on the exam process. Some activities that may
help:
• Compare statistics on sexual assault within the community as captured by represented agencies.
• Identify community demographics, including the various populations that make up the area.
• Review existing feedback from victims about their experiences and satisfaction with immediate
response.
• Seek input from professionals involved in the exam process on current gaps, problems, and
challenges.
• Evaluate the adequacy of policies pertaining to each aspect of immediate response.
• Review systemic breakdowns that have occurred in immediate response.
• Evaluate the capacity of each discipline to support a coordinated immediate response.
• Evaluate the effectiveness of response to victims from diverse backgrounds or in certain types of
cases.
• Evaluate the adequacy of related trainings and resource materials.
• Identify related jurisdictional statutes and evaluate their adequacy in supporting effective response.
Devise an action plan. The protocol planning team can take what it learns through needs assessments and
translate it into an action plan for improving the exam process and creating a protocol. The plan should
clearly identify what needs to happen, who is responsible for coordinating or carrying out each action,
possible resources,317 desired outcomes, and how the effectiveness of the action will be evaluated. The plan
can be revisited periodically to assess progress and evaluate outcomes.
316 Section drawn from K. Littel, M. Malefyt, and A. Walker, Promising Practices: Improving the Criminal Justice System’s Response to
Violence Against Women, 1998, pp. 240 and 246, and American College of Emergency Physicians, Evaluation and Management of the
Sexually Assaulted or Sexually Abused Patient, 1999, p. 21.
317 Funding under the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program and the STOP Violence Against Indian Women
Discretionary Grant Program may be used to cover costs related to protocol development and implementation. For more information,
see http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/.
129Create a protocol. To promote an effective protocol development process, consider the following:318
• Who should lead efforts to create and implement the protocol?
• What process will be used to facilitate decision making on protocol development or revision?
• What process will be used for facilitating adoption of the protocol by individual agencies or
communities?
• How will protocol compliance be monitored and what mechanisms will be put into place to solve
problems as they arise?
The planning team should review the national protocol to determine what it wants to cover in its customized
protocol and the appropriateness of national recommendations for the jurisdiction. It must consider what
jurisdictional statutes and policies need to be discussed and how to address community-specific needs and
challenges. Once a draft has been developed, it should be made available to relevant professionals,
agencies, survivor groups, and organizations serving specific populations across the jurisdiction. Their
feedback should be solicited and then incorporated into the draft to the extent possible. Once a final protocol
is created, the team should consider pilot testing and revising it based on feedback from the tests. Then the
protocol should be implemented, as per recommendations of team members and others from whom input
has been sought.
Distribute the protocol. The planning team should determine the most efficient method to disseminate the
protocol to all professionals in the jurisdictions who are involved in the immediate response to sexual assault.
The planning team needs an up-to-date contact list of these professionals, and it should agree upon a
specific distribution plan (e.g., mailing or handing out hard copies and/or providing access to the protocol via
the Internet). If the Internet is used to distribute the document, make sure that professionals who do not have
Internet access get a hard copy.
Build the capacity of agencies to implement the protocol.319 A protocol’s effectiveness depends on individual
agencies having adequate resources (e.g., funding, personnel, multilanguage capacity, equipment,
supervision, training, professional development opportunities, and community partnerships) to carry out their
responsibilities and coordinate efforts with other involved responders. Agencies can assist one another in
building individual and collective capacity to respond to sexual assault and participate in coordinated
interventions. For example, together they can seek opportunities for technical assistance, training, and
grants and share costs, personnel, equipment, expertise, and information. Also, each jurisdiction most likely
will encounter a variety of barriers and difficulties in protocol implementation. Overcoming such problems
requires a willingness on the part of involved agencies to individually and collaboratively understand the
unique needs of victims in their community and to think “outside the box” to identify solutions.
To help with implementation, consider asking responding agencies to supplement the protocol with
interagency agreements or memorandums of understanding. Using the protocol as a basis, these
agreements can outline roles and articulate how responders should work together to coordinate response.
These documents should be jointly developed, agreed upon, and signed by agency policymakers. They can
be revised and signed on a periodic basis to ensure all professionals involved in the response are aware of
protocol changes and to reaffirm their commitment to carrying out agreements.
Promote training. Agency-specific and multidisciplinary trainings are crucial components of protocol
implementation. Involved responders must be informed of any changes in how they carry out agency-specific
responsibilities during the exam process and understand why these changes are needed. If they are being
asked to coordinate their efforts formally with other agencies, they must understand their role in coordination,
the benefits of a collaborative response, the challenges such an effort involves, and ways to overcome
challenges.

130Set up an evaluation system. The planning team should take the time to consider how to best compile data
related to the exam process (while maintaining victims’ anonymity) and how to use it to evaluate
effectiveness of response and make improvements to the protocol as needed.
Revise the protocol periodically. Revisions may be based on feedback from responders and victims,
evaluation recommendations, changes in laws, identification of new crime trends and prevention efforts,
technology, research, and identification of new promising practices. The planning team should keep track of
protocol areas needing improvement and meet periodically to discuss pertinent issues such as language to
be used, how to resolve controversies, and, ultimately, to make needed changes.
131132Appendix B. Creation of Sexual Assault
Response and Resource Teams
Create a SART/SARRT to facilitate coordination among involved disciplines.320 After identifying
members and defining roles, members can plan how to operate their team to best serve community needs.
Determine how the SART/SARRT is activated. Activation procedures should take into account that victims
enter the “system” at different points (e.g., through a call to 911 or a 24-hour advocacy hotline, arrival at an
exam site, or disclosure to a community professional). The SART/SARRT must determine how to publicize
its services to community professionals who may have frequent contact with individuals disclosing sexual
assaults. These professionals might include, but are not limited to, private physicians, health clinic staff,
mental health and social service program staff, personnel serving persons with disabilities, substance abuse
treatment program staff, school personnel, personnel from faith-based communities, corrections and
probation staff, and staff from residential living programs and emergency shelters. It also should publicize its
services more broadly to the public, explain the dynamics of sexual assault, and encourage victims to seek
help.
Plan SART/SARRT response to varying circumstances facing victims. The team should consider and plan for
modifications to the exam process to address specific needs and concerns of victims. For example, in order
to respond to non-English-speaking victims, team members must be able to speak their language or
promptly arrange for certified interpretation. For victims thought to have cognitive disabilities, team members
must know who to contact for assistance and ensure they receive the same access to services that other
victims would obtain. Some victims may request advocates and other responders of a specific gender or
from specific cultures. Procedures should be in place to ensure response to minors follows jurisdictional
statutes. SART/SARRTs should be prepared to deal with multijurisdictional coordination issues that may
arise when assaults occur on military sites or to soldiers in the field, school campuses, tribal lands, prisons,
and residential programs. Involving relevant agencies as soon as possible according to agreed-upon
procedures may help quickly determine who has jurisdiction over a case and how to best assist each victim.
Meet regularly. Outside of an immediate response, the SART/SARRT should meet regularly321 for two distinct
purposes. The first is to review immediate response in individual cases in order to improve overall team
performance. These reviews allow team members the opportunity to give each other feedback on
effectiveness of response during the exam process, problems needing resolution, and areas needing
improvement. Cases are typically reviewed anonymously, 322 without using victims’ names or other identifying
information.323 During these discussions, it is important that the team respect the confidentiality of information
in patients’ medical records and shared with community-based advocates. Secondly, the SART/SARRT can
utilize meetings of members to maintain and enhance the quality of the SART/SARRT. This task involves
addressing system issues, such as creating and revising policies and procedures in response to local
changes in governmental or community-based agencies, scientific or technological advances, and feedback
320 A more in depth discussion of SART development and maintenance than is provided is beyond the scope of this document.
However, resources do exist on this topic. For example, numerous jurisdictions have published guidebooks on organizing a SART
and/or protocols for SART response. Some sexual assault coalitions offer information, technical assistance, and training for
communities interested in starting SARTs. Since 2001, a national SART training conference has been held biannually (see
http://www.sane-sart.com/ for information). More information, including a SART Toolkit, is available at http://www.nsvrc.org.
321 “Regularly” is locally defined. Some teams meet monthly, while others meet every 6 weeks or quarterly. Teams might meet on a
regular basis for case review and get together less frequently to discuss more systemic issues.
322 In California, there is a law to protect discussions of individual cases during SART meetings. These discussions are technically
characterized as medical quality-assurance activities.
323 Case reviews usually include only those SART members typically involved in immediate response. But, even if all or most SART
members were involved in a particular case and were aware of victims’ identity, there is still no reason to reveal victims’ identity during
SART case reviews. SARTs may choose not to take notes about cases reviewed to ensure that the case-related information is not
shared with anyone outside of the meeting. In situations where victims’ identity might be easily deduced during a case review by
members not involved in response (e.g., if there had only been one case handled during the time period being reviewed), comments
should be kept as broad as possible and avoid case specifics. In communities where residents tend to know each other and news about
crime travels quickly, it may be challenging to not inadvertently reveal victims’ identify during SART case reviews. SARTs in these
jurisdictions should consider how to best approach case reviews in a way that reduces the likelihood of revealing victims’ identify.
133from victims. It also involves sharing general information related to the SART/SARRT and facilitating the
continuing education of the team.
Although it might be difficult to involve all relevant responders in SART/SARRT meetings (e.g., crime labs
may be a considerable distance from the community and lack resources to respond to local inquiries),
consider options such as teleconferencing to include their perspectives.
Encourage education for SART/SARRT members on coordinated response during the exam process.
For example:
• Discipline-specific training that advances responder skills and emphasizes a team approach is
crucial.
• Multidisciplinary training sessions can describe the SART/SARRT process, stress the need for a
prompt exam, explain the roles and challenges of each discipline, emphasize a victim-centered
approach, and make clear where coordination among disciplines is needed and how it should occur.
They can describe multidisciplinary policies, interagency agreements, standardized forms, and other
related materials.
• Multidisciplinary training can also build members’ understanding of needs, values/beliefs, and
practices of specific populations in their community. They can raise awareness of how different
populations respond to disclosures of sexual assault and work to build the capacity of involved
professionals to be sensitive to the needs of victims from those populations.
• Cross-training sessions are useful to allow responders from one discipline to educate those from
another discipline about the specifics of how they intervene in these cases and answer questions
that may arise. For example, law enforcement investigators can educate examiners and advocates
about what is involved in a thorough investigation, stressing that the forensic exam of the victim is
but one part of the investigation. In jurisdictions that border Indian Country, federal prosecutors can
educate other responders regarding federal Indian law and how it applies to sexual assault cases.
• Multidisciplinary trainings and cross-trainings can provide a forum for staff from different agencies to
get to know and respect one another, build common goals, and increase their comfort in working
together. Collaboration among agencies and individuals can provide responders with a broader
network of support as they do this work. These trainings can also stress the difficulty of working on
sexual assault cases and the secondary trauma that responders can experience. They can facilitate
discussion among responders about self-care and preventing or coping with secondary trauma, so
they in turn can provide optimal interventions and assistance to victims.
• There are more informal educational opportunities and tools that can foster coordination among
SART/SARRT members. For example, all key responders, especially those newly involved in sexual
assault cases, may find it useful to tour sites and offices involved in SART/SARRT response. Such
tours and discussions with site/office staff can help build knowledge of what response by each
discipline entails and the logistics of that response. Sharing related educational materials and
literature is an easy way to continuously expand the base of common knowledge among
SART/SARRT members. Tools such as flow charts and discipline-specific checklists that help
SART/SARRT members understand the continuum of response and appropriately coordinate their
interventions may also be useful.
Trainers. In addition to involving representatives from health care, advocacy, law enforcement, prosecution,
the judiciary, and crime and toxicology laboratories as SART/SARRT trainers, include defense attorneys to
educate participants on defense tactics. Utilize local agencies and leaders that serve specific populations to
educate the SART/SARRT on the needs of residents and services they offer relevant to victims of sexual
assault.
Outreach to rural, remote, and poor communities. It may be difficult for rural, remote, and poor communities
to offer training for SART/SARRT members, due to lack of resources and/or expertise. States, Territories,
and tribes may want to consider forming specialized teams that can offer multidisciplinary training consistent
with cutting-edge practices across all of their jurisdictions. These teams can work with local responders to
ensure that the training sessions they offer address unique community needs and challenges.
134Appendix C. Impact of Crawford v. Washington, Davis v.
Washington and Giles v. California
Crawford v. Washington and subsequent related court cases are only an issue when a victim is unavailable
for cross-examination at trial, which occurs infrequently in sexual assault cases. A prosecutor will rarely be
able to prosecute successfully a sexual assault of a competent adult victim without the victim’s cooperation
because of the difficulty in overcoming the consent defense. The term “competent adult” is used to describe
an adult victim who is viewed by the legal system as able to understand and participate in the criminal
proceedings, i.e., know the role of all the players. It is important to refer to state laws for definitions or
interpretations of what constitutes a competent adult in a given jurisdiction.
In the rare instance in which a sexual assault of a competent adult is prosecuted without the victim’s
cooperation, examiners’ testimony may be objected to as “testimonial” hearsay under Crawford v.
Washington324 and Davis v. Washington325 under the theory that the examiner was acting as an arm of law
enforcement. In Crawford, the Court held that testimonial statements of an unavailable witness could be
admitted at trial only when the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine that witness. Although
the Crawford holding offers examples of both testimonial and nontestimonial statements, it did not include a
specific definition.
In Davis, the Court defined statements that are made to government agents for the primary purpose of
receiving assistance in an ongoing emergency as nontestimonial. It defined as testimonial statements made
under circumstances that objectively indicate there is no ongoing emergency and the primary purpose of the
interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a later criminal prosecution. Forensic
examiners who perceive their primary role as law enforcement and conduct their practice with law
enforcement rather than medical goals risk having their statements excluded as testimonial under Crawford
and Davis. Forensic examiners should be asked about and must be able to articulate a practice philosophy
that is patient-centered and medically focused.
In cases in which it is established that the victim’s lack of cooperation is the result of a defendant’s actions
that are designed to cause the unavailability of a victim in order to prevent that victim from testifying in a
current or future prosecution, the prosecution may introduce a witness’ hearsay statements in a prosecution
based on the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.
For health-care providers, Crawford and its progeny do not change the priorities of the medical-forensic
examination, which should continue to hold the health and well-being of patients of primary importance. The
problem arises when clinicians are perceived to be investigators rather than health-care providers. Even in
cases in which a victim is cooperating in the prosecution of the perpetrator, statements made to the examiner
for the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment may still be excluded as hearsay if it is established that
the examiner is acting as an arm of law enforcement rather than acting primarily as a medical treatment
provider.326

REPORT WRITING MANUAL
PURPOSE
Writing a good police report is a vital part of conducting a complete and comprehensive investigation.
The purpose of this Manual is to update the report writing regulations for the Berkeley Police
Department. This Manual is being issued to take the place of the 2003 Special Order #03-026 “Report
Writing Regulations” which had previously taken the place of the 1991 General Order R-31 “Report
Writing Rules”.
To encourage crime reporting and cooperation in the investigation of criminal activity, all individuals,
regardless of their immigration status, must feel secure that contacting or being addressed by members
of law enforcement will not automatically lead to immigration inquiry and/ or deportation. While it may
be necessary to determine the identity of a victim or witness, members shall treat all individuals equally
and without regard to race, color or national origin in any way that would violate the United States or
California Constitutions.
REPORT WRITING - DEFINED
Report writing is defined as the accurate recording of facts and other pertinent information, presented
in a clear, complete, and logical manner, so that the information may be communicated to others.
REPORT WRITING - GOALS
The first goal of report writing is to present all relevant information with clarity, accuracy, completeness
and objectivity. The second goal is to apply the basic principles of correct and appropriate written
expression.
The two goals are not separate; they are integral parts of the process of written communication that
constitute a police report.
DEFINITIONS
Listed below are definitions pertaining to this Policy:
• Initial Report: The Case Report written by the handling employee documenting the details of
the preliminary investigation.
• Supplemental Report: A report that provides additional information about the case. This may
include:
Reports prepared by employees designated to assist the employee who prepares the
o
initial report.
Follow-up reports to an initial investigation.

• Attachments: Documents that accompany reports (diagrams, statements, ID reports, etc.).
• Report Forms: Various forms the Department has developed and/or uses, to ensure that
specific topic areas will be addressed during the-investigation and recording of an incident.
REPORT WRITING CHARACTERISTICS
Reports shall have the following characteristics:
• Accuracy: Employees are expected to make every effort to ensure that reports are accurate·
(without error}, and factual (supported by evidence). Accurate names, addresses, dates and
times, etc., are absolutely· essential to a good report. When opinions and conclusions are
necessary, they shall be labeled as
• Clarity: Employees shall take particular care to prepare reports that are clear and
understandable. Reports shall not be written in such a way that they are likely to be
misinterpreted by different readers. Employees shall avoid the use of vague or ambiguous
words that are likely to mislead or confuse the reader of the report.
• Completeness: Reports shall fully document details of the investigation. A complete report will
tell the reader everything known about the incident, and · document the assigned and assisting
officers' activities to the current stage of the investigation. Reports that· require an oral
explanation are not considered complete.
• Conciseness: A report is concise when the full message is provided in as few words as possible.
When useless words are eliminated, the report will be shorter and more direct; essential words
will stand out. Avoid repetition, but do not omit relevant information.
• Objectivity: Reports .shall be written in an impartial, unbiased, and unemotional manner.
• Legibility: All hand-printed reports are required to neat and legible.
DEPARTMENT FORMAT
Department format refers to the way our Department requires information to be organized and
presented in the narrative/supplemental portion of the report. This format excludes those reports
qualified for handling via Mobile Data Terminals/Mobile Data Browsers.
Each format topic shall be written in capital letters and underlined. If the format category(s) is not
applicable or pertinent, then it does not need to be included.
The format categories for Departmental narrative/supplemental reports are as follows:

SUMMARY
Requires a brief synopsis.be provided detailing the basic facts and elements of the crime(s).
• Example: An unknown subject pointed a gun at Smith and demanded his wallet. Fearing for
his life, Smith gave his wallet to the suspect.
• Example: An unknown subject(s) pried open the locked front door to the residence at 833
Gilman Street. The subject stole two laptops and remains outstanding.
• Example: Joe Johnson, the Tower Record security guard, saw Davis place a DVD inside her
jacket and leave the store without paying for the merchandise. Johnson signed a Citizen’s
Arrest form. Davis was cited and released.
STATEMENTS
Written or recorded statements shall be taken for in-custody cases, including those cases involving
private person arrests. (Note: In situations such as a petty theft from a business, the security guard's
report can suffice as the statement, providing the elements of the crimes have clearly been articulated).
Written or recorded statements shall be taken in cases when the case is being sent to the District
Attorney's Office for consideration of criminal charges.
A supervisor may also direct an officer to take a written or recorded statement regardless of the offense
classification (e.g., complex investigations, civil matters, etc.).
If an officer is unable.to take a written statement, the reason(s) should be indicated in the report (e g.,
victim in the hospital, witness refusal to give a written statement, etc.)·.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS
A written statement is a first person, chronological narrative of the events of the crime. It should include
the victim's or witness' description of the suspect(s) and a verbatim account of what the suspect said
and did. Be sure to include as much other relevant detail (such as weapon description and use) as the
person can remember. The individual's statement ·should always include a description of the actions
that establish the elements of crime required.
The officer should write the statement for the victim or witness. This ensures the statement while being
as complete and as accurate as possible, remains concise and focused. The statement should be in
3BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
the person's own words as much as possible. For example, the officer should not write a victim/witness
statement using police ''jargon'' type terms or abbreviations.
PROCEDURES
Written statement: Initially ask the open ended question of “what happened?” and allow the victim to
tell you about the incident in their own words. As they do this, write down notes, including questions
you’d like to follow up on. Such as if the person says, “The guy ran away and I called the police”, you
may follow up with, “what did the man look like? Which way did he go? Where did you call the police
from?” etc.
After you’ve asked your follow up questions, attempt to repeat the story from the beginning to the
person. You may start writing the statement at this point. Write up to a point in the story and ask if
they have anything to add to the statement so far, if not, continue writing a paragraph or page at a time
and clarify, if needed, with the person as you go. Any corrected errors or added language should be
initialed. Once finished writing the statement, always ask if they have anything else to add. Then have
the person read and sign each statement page. If they are unable to sign the statement, or
subsequently refuse, this should be written in the signature block and in the report.
LANGUAGE BARRIERS
In language barrier situations, the officer should attempt to find an appropriate bilingual
officer/employee or translator to take a statement. There is a need for flexibility in situations involving
language barriers. For example, a Spanish speaking victim might want to give their statement in
Spanish. The bilingual employee should prepare a summary of the statement for inclusion in the
investigation. It might also be necessary for the bilingual employee to later re- write the victim/witness
statement in English.
SUMMARIZE / PARAPHRASE
Victim/Witness Summarized or Paraphrased Statements:
• Summarize (cover the main points briefly)
• Paraphrase (restate using different words without changing the meaning)
Summarize or paraphrase statements made by involved parties. Use separate paragraphs for each
involved person. The statement should answer who, what, why, where, when, and how for each victim
and witness. Do not blend statements.
Example: Smith told me he parked and locked his car in the parking space in front of the apartment
building at 2112 Haste Street. Smith said his car is equipped with· a factory alarm system, which is
activated when a door is opened. Smith forgot to take his cellular telephone, leaving it in plain sight on
the passenger seat when he parked the car. Smith said he did not give anyone permission to enter his
car and take the cellular telephone.
4BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
RECORDED STATEMENTS
If a statement is tape recorded, the officer should provide a summary of the statement in his/her
investigative report.
SUSPECT STATEMENTS
Statements denying the crime, giving an alibi or some other excuse concerning the crime are very
important because recently arrested suspects will often have very little time to concoct convincing
falsehoods.
While taking the suspect's statement, officers should ask questions related to the suspect's account of
the incident. For example, if a suspect gives
Officers should make note of the time when advising the Suspect of his/her Miranda rights and the
suspect’s exact response to that warning, including any waiver of those rights. Even if a suspect does
not waive his/her Miranda rights, officers should keep in· mind that volunteered or spontaneous
statements that are not the result of any questioning by the police, are still admissible, and accordingly,
should be reported in detail.
Officers should refer to the Temporary Custody of Juveniles Policy for additional Miranda juvenile
guidelines.
DISPOSITIONS:
Describe the disposition of property, evidence, vehicles, persons arrested, etc. This category also
covers the investigation status or additional steps that are warranted.
Example: I booked the purse into BPD Property Room for safekeeping.
Example: I booked the stereo into the BPD Property Room. I entered the stereo into APS (Automated
Property System) as 'evidence'
Example: Officer Perkins booked Brown into BPD jail for burglary and possession of stolen property.
Example: Freeman indicated she wanted to pursue battery charges against Waldman. Case forwarded
to the DA for consideration of charging.
Example: Pauley is compiling a list of all the property stolen from her home. This case will be forwarded
to Property Crimes for follow up.
INVESTIGATIVE CASE STATUS
• Closed Status: This status shall be used only when conditions meet the requirements of the
Department's major disposition code that includes the Uniform Crime Reporting Regulations
and supplements thereto. In most cases, "closed” will be used only when the responsible has
been identified, arrested, and/or the investigation completed. The case may also be closed with
the arrest of one suspect, even if more are outstanding or unknown.
5BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
• Suspend Status: This status shall apply in cases where the assigned employee has
investigated all leads and is unable to accomplish more to close the case. Suspended means
the investigation is inactive and no further reports will be submitted until additional information
or evidence is developed to restore it to active status. To be suspended, the report must be
reviewed and the suspension approved by a Supervisor.
• Follow-up Status: This status shall apply to a case under active investigation which needs
additional investigation which the officer cannot complete. This may be due to time constraints
or staffing. Follow up responsibilities for Patrol and the Investigations Division can be found in
the Preliminary Investigations Policy.
ROUTING
Employees preparing reports shall ensure the report is submitted in AEGIS. If there is an in-custody
arrest or a request for a complaint, the PC Dec needs to be added to the “In-Custody” box.
GENERAL REPORT WRITING REQUIREMENTS
Completed Preliminary Investigation
The activities of an employee assigned to investigative an incident shall be decisive and constitute a
definite step toward the completion and disposition of the case. A completed preliminary investigation
is one which, when reviewed, leaves no initial questions unanswered; the reviewer can recognize
whether further investigation (follow-up) is warranted or whether the case should be suspended from
further active investigation.
First Person
Reports shall be written in the "First Person" writing style. Employees shall not use terms such as,
"this officer", "Reporting Officer" (or "R/O''), "the undersigned" etc., when referring to themselves in
reports.
Active Voice
Reports shall be written in "Active Voice" writing style. In addition to making reports more concise, the
active voice style clearly specifies who did what action, an essential element of law enforcement
reports.
Example: In the passive voice sentence, “A gun was found to be under the bush" the reader does not
know “who” found the gun. In the active voice, the sentence ·would read, "I found a gun under the
bush."
Example: "The knife was collected and placed into evidence." This is passive voice and is not
acceptable. In active voice, the sentence would be written as ''Officer Johnson collected the knife and
placed it into evidence."
6BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
Labeling
The practice of “labeling" (referring to persons as "Victim #1”, “V#2”, “Witness”, ''suspect'' should be
avoided in those cases where the person's name is known. If the person's last name is known, it should
be used.
For example, if John Smith is a victim of burglary, he should be referred to as "Smith'' throughout the
narrative instead of “V#1” or Victim #1”. Exceptions to this requirement are as follows:
• Cases where a subject's name is not known: In those situations, refer to persons as "Suspect
#1”, “S#1” etc. is allowed.
• Same surname: If two or more persons involved in an incident share the same last name, they
shall be identified by use of their first initial and last name, or by an involvement code (“V”, “W”,
“RP”, etc.) preceding their last name. Example: J. Smith said his daughter, R. Smith, saw a
suspicious-car driving around their neighborhood the day prior or (V) Jones said his son (RP)
Jones was home asleep when their home was broken into.
• Penal Code 293: Victim Exceptions: Per California Penal Code Section 293, investigating
officers shall notify victims of specific offenses that they have the option of requesting their
name not be a matter of public record. The name and any identifying information of such a
victim shall be listed only on the first page of the Case Report. All other references to the victim
within the report shall use the term ''victim'' as required by Penal Code Section 293.
Confidentiality
Although Penal Code Section 11107 and Government Code Section 625.4 have been commonly
construed as making police reports "confidential”, recent court decisions have held that absent
specified circumstances, the entire report must be made available to the public. Victims and witnesses,
who request that their names remain “confidential” shall be told that their request will be noted.
However, the Department cannot guarantee that any information contained in a report will not be
provided to suspects, the public, or the press.
Abbreviations
Only common, widely accepted abbreviations shall be used. Race/Sex/Age Group abbreviations are
specifically outlined in General Order R-27.
Jargon
Employees shall avoid the use of police jargon and phraseology when writing reports. Reports shall
be written in a clear, natural writing style so that they will be understandable and of use to individuals
outside the law enforcement environment.
Slang and Profanity
7BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
Slang or profanity shall not be used except as necessary to quote statements made by suspects (e.g.,
for modus operandi purposes). When reporting verbatim statements made by victims, witnesses or
suspects, quotation marks shall be used as appropriate.
Opinions/Conclusions
Except when appropriate (e.g., a narrative summary for the purposes of establishing credentials, law
enforcement expertise, articulation of probable cause, factors supporting a detention and/or arrest,
etc.), opinions and conclusions should not be present in the report. An officer's report shall not include
words or phrases that belittle, ridicule or humiliate persons, groups or institutions unless the words or
phrases are material to the incident or complaint being investigated.
Information contained in police reports must be objective and relevant to the investigation.
WRITTEN REPORTS
Written reports should be written in block form (without indentation), single-spaced, with double-
spacing between paragraphs. Hand written reports shall be written in all capital letters, and with a black
ink pen. Paragraphs should contain details for one topic area. Every sentence in a paragraph must
relate to the paragraph's main idea.
Case/Page Number(s)
Employees are to ensure that all documents filed have the report case number in the upper right corner
on each page (including both sides of a document if writing appears on each side) i.e. a criminal arrest
history printout shall have the case number written in the upper right hand corner.
FIELD NOTES
There will be situations where employees may find it useful or necessary to write notes prior to the
preparation of the report. Current law does not require the retention of field notes once the report is
written; however, notes may only be discarded if:
1. It is done in "good faith, and with no intent to hide or deceive.
2. The destruction of notes does not violate a Department regulation or policy.
It shall be Department policy that field notes may be discarded once the report has been written and
the report accurately reflects the contents of the notes.
Exceptions: An exception are those cases where notes contain information not directly transferable to
the police report; these notes should be retained and booked as evidence.
PERSONS - DESCRIPTIONS
Employees shall obtain complete identifying information, whenever possible, from all persons
8BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
contacted. Complete information shall include the last name, first name, and middle initial or middle
name.
Telephone numbers shall include area codes. Officers should get alternative methods of contact
whenever possible, such as email addresses, home phone, work phone, etc.
If the individual is temporarily staying elsewhere, include the temporary address in the report narrative.
• Exception: This requirement does not pertain to cases involving domestic violence. To ensure
the safety of the victim(s), temporary addresses should never be included in police report. The
assigned officer shall ensure this contact information gets conveyed to investigative personnel
(e.g., via e mail, memorandum, voice mail message).
PROPERTY AND EVIDENCE
Many reports will involve property. Whether lost, found, stolen, recovered or taken for observation,
there are specific guidelines established by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) for the reporting
of property. BPD personnel must be familiar with and follow carefully the DOJ requirements.
Individual items of property shall be listed with the report and categorized as follows:
• Stolen
• Recovered
• Lost
• Evidence
• Safekeeping
• Recovered
Provide a physical description, model name or number, color, size and other condition or defect.
If the item is unusual or difficult to describe, supplement the report with a sketch or photograph, if
available. The goal is to provide as much detail as possible in order to help identify the item later if
needed.
Provide the serial number or other identifying number for the item.
Value: Known or estimated 100% value, rounded to the next whole dollar. Use exact values where
necessary to establish crime class or in cases where exact value is essential to accuracy of the report
(e.g., an in-custody shoplifting case).
In most other cases, the victim's evaluation can be accepted.
Use the retail value for articles subjected to depreciation because of use, etc., or other factors that
cause the value to decrease with use. Insurance companies will determine fair market value.
Use the wholesale cost (cost to the merchant) of goods stolen-from inventory, warehouses, etc.
9BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
Use replacement cost for new or almost new items.
SUBMISSION OF REPORTS
Procedures for Uniform personnel: Uniformed personnel are defined as. Patrol Team members,
Special Enforcement Unit/Drug Task Force, Bike Officers, Reserve Officers and Community Service
Officers. Uniformed personnel are expected to file each day, before closing their tour of duty, a full
report of their activities in connection with the cases assigned to them.
When applicable, this includes offense forms, supplementals, diagrams, or other reports assigned by
a supervisor.
Uniformed personnel shall submit all completed reports into AEGIS for review. Any additional
documents which need to be attached to the case should be placed in the appropriate Patrol Team
report tray.
LATE REPORTS - PATROL
The following list illustrates those types of reports and/or situations that could qualify for late
submission of a police report providing the “Late Report” request has been approved by a supervisor.
• A protracted, in-progress case still requiring several hours of investigation and/or report writing.
Example: An assault via deadly weapon with the assigned officer responsible, for compiling
a comprehensive narrative, as well as coordinating the supplemental reports of all assisting
officers.
• Completion of non-critical reports (e.g. cold burglaries, non-custodial theft reports, etc.) that
would otherwise require expenditure of paid/compensatory overtime .for the reports to be
submitted during the same tour of duty. Example: An officer assigned to a non-injury collision
involving multiple vehicles, driver statements, witnesses, etc.
• An officer's inability to get a mandated statement from a witness or victim during their tour of
duty (e.g., victim in the emergency room, witness left Berkeley prior· to police contact, etc.).
Unless there are mitigating circumstances, reports involving any in-custody arrests or missing
adults/juveniles should not be approved for late submittal.
Supervisors need to keep in mind the officer's schedule. For example, reports should not be
approved for late submittal if an officer is going on his/her days off.
LATE REPORTS - DD / SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS
Report Submittal Procedures for Investigative personnel: Investigative personnel are defined as Traffic
Officers, Detective Bureau, Special Investigations Bureau officers and Identification Technicians .· Due
to the nature of their assignment, the initial report and/or supplemental investigative reports they have
10BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
been assigned should be filed within a week.
Investigative personnel shall get supervisory approval for any exception to the above requirement.
A situation warranting an exception to the submission requirements might be an internal investigation.
Supervisory personnel assigned to various investigative units (e.g., Traffic Bureau, Detective Bureau,
Special Investigation Bureau and Identification Technicians) are responsible for setting up procedures
governing report submittal and review processes.
PATROL SERGEANT REPORT REVIEW AND ROUTING PROCEDURES
Sergeants shall ensure they review those reports submitted to AEGIS respective to their Patrol Team.
Sergeants, who supervised other uniformed personnel (e.g., Special Enforcement Unit/Drug Task
Force, Community Service Officers, Community Services Bureau/Crime Analysis Unit, Bike Officers,
Reserve Officers, etc.), shall ensure they review all reports submitted by their personnel during their
work shifts.
A sergeant whose officer is staying late to work on an IN-CUSTODY case shall confer with another

SHORT REPORTS
“Short” reports consist only of an “Investigative Narrative”. Short reports are appropriate when
there are no suspects or leads, such as a 459 auto or 10851. For example:
INVESTIGATIVE NARRATIVE:
12BERKELEY POLICE DEPARTMENT
REPORT WRITING MANUAL
On 2/23/13 at 1147 hrs I contacted Nead at her home regarding a stolen auto report. Nead advised
she parked her vehicle last night at 1800 hrs on the west side of Ellis St. just north of Russell St. Nead
advised she came out this morning and saw it was gone. Nead advised that she left the vehicle locked,
all keys are accounted for and no one has permission to drive the vehicle.
I gave Nead advice and a report receipt. I conducted an area check for the vehicle with negative
results. I entered the vehicle into SVS and had Dispatch broadcast a BOLO.
Nothing further.
DESCRIPTIVE WORDS
When describing a scene, it is often easy to use a basic description to get to the next portion of the
report, i.e. “the apartment was in disarray”. However, you aren’t doing the scene justice, especially if
details may become useful at a later time. So instead of, “ the apartment was in disarray”, you might
say, “I observed dirty clothing on the floor and on the furniture. Dirty dishes in the sink, flies throughout
the apartment, I could smell the strong odor of ammonia and observed a dirty litter box in the corner.
Beer bottles and cigarette butts littered the coffee table.
You may think writing this is redundant when you have a body camera or there was video taken of the
scene, but usually those looking at the case initially wont view the video until much later. It’s imperative
to convey situation to get the attention of the reader, to paint the picture and help them understand
what happened.

CALL TAKING
SCOPE

911 EMERGENCY CALLS
STANDARDS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Standard for Answering 9-1-1 Calls. At all times, ninety five percent (95%) of all 9-1-1 calls in the
communications Center should be answered within twenty (20) seconds (approximately 6 rings).
During the hours of 1000-1900, ninety percent (90%) of all 9-1-1 calls shall be answered within ten
(10) seconds (approximately 3 rings).
2. Order of Answering Priority. It is the responsibility of on duty call takers to answer all in-coming
calls. All phone calls shall be answered in order of priority.
a. 1st priority will be 9-1-1 lines
b. 2nd priority will be emergency 7/10 digit phone lines
c. 3rd priority will be non-emergency lines
d. 4th priority will be fire, administrative and/or internal phone lines
3. Standard Answering Protocols
a. 9-1-1 lines. All 9-1-1 lines shall be answered “9-1-1, what is the address of the
emergency?”
b. 7 digit emergency and non-emergency lines: the call taker shall clearly identify both the
answering Agency and themselves.
c. Fire, administrative and/or internal phone lines. When answering in house and direct connect lines,
the call taker shall clearly identify both the answering agency and themselves.
4. WIRELESS 911 PHASES- Wireless 9-1-1 Call Routing
All wireless and wireline 9-1-1 calls are received in the Communications Center on the same trunks.
This system has been implemented to insure that wireless calls are handled in the same manner
as wireline calls.
Phase 0 (Zero) Occurs when a wireless 9-1-1 call is delivered to the Communications Center with
or without call-back or location information. In an Enhanced 9-1-1 environment the Communications
Center may receive the following information: the tower-face or routing telephone number identifier,
location of the tower that is handling the call and wireless service provider.
Phase I Occurs when a wireless 9-1-1 call is delivered to the Communications Center with the
following information: wireless phone call back number, location of the tower that is handling the
call and identification of the wireless service provider responsible for the tower that is handling the
call.
Phase II Occurs when a wireless 9-1-1 call is delivered to the Communications Center with the
approximate location of the wireless caller based on the X, Y (longitude and latitude) coordinates
determined by the system. In the event Phase II information is not delivered with the initial call
data, the call taker should wait ten (10) seconds before initiating a re-transmittal.
TRANSFERRING CALLS
1. Non-Emergency Calls Received on Emergency Lines. If a call is of a non-emergency nature
and it is received on an emergency telephone line, the dispatcher will advise the caller that they
have called on an emergency line and will direct the caller to a non-emergency line. It is not
recommended that the call be transferred to an administrative line, since that may tie up the 9-1-1
trunks.
2. Transferring Emergency Calls. When emergency calls need to be transferred to another agency,5
egaP
the dispatcher will transfer the call without delay. The dispatcher will advise the caller: “Please do not hang
up; I am connecting you with (name of the agency).” The dispatcher should stay on the line until the
connection is complete and all pertinent information has been relayed to the answering PSAP.
4. Misrouted Calls/ Incorrect ANI/ALI Information. Calls may be received by this Agency that are
intended for another Agency or display incorrect location information on the ALI screen. The call
taker should complete an Alameda County Report of Misroute or Incorrect ALI Information from
and forward it to a Supervisor for processing.
PROCESSING CALLS (LANDLINE AND WIRELESS)
1. Abandoned Calls/Disconnects. The call taker will attempt a call back when a landline or wireless
9-1-1 call is received and the call disconnects before the dispatcher can determine if assistance is
needed. The dispatcher will call the number back once to make this determination. If the phone is
busy or there is no answer, additional attempts to contact the caller will not be made by the
dispatcher. If the callback attempt goes to voicemail, no message will be left. If the call taker is
unable to make contact and verify that no assistance is needed, a call for service shall be
created using the CFS type “A911 or W911”.
2. Silent Calls. In compliance with Public Law 101-336, also known as the Americans with Disibilities
Act, all silent calls will be interrogated with a TTY/TDD to determine if the caller is attempting to
report an emergency using a special communications device for hearing impaired individuals. If the
call taker is unable to verify that no assistance is needed, a call for service shall be created
using the CFS type “A911 or W911” and attempt to communicate/contact shall be
documented in the call narrative.
3. Contact. If contact is made with the caller, the call taker shall interview the caller to determine
whether a Police, Fire or Medical response is required.
 Indicated emergency. Any evidence of an emergency situation requires that the call taker
initiate efforts to re-contact the caller to determine the nature of the incident and an accurate
location for appropriate public safety response. If attempts to contact the caller are
unsuccessful, a call for service shall be created based on the caller location provided
by the ANI/ALI. Extraordinary attempts to locate a Phase I or II wireless 9-1-1
disconnect caller will only be made in the instance where an emergency is clearly
indicated.
 Discretion. The call taker should pay close attention to background noise, tone and word
choice of the caller as additional evidence to assist with determination of the status of the 9-1-
1 call. The time of day and location of the caller may be additional clues to indicate whether a
response is necessary. In any situation where the call taker believes an emergency
situation may exist, a call for service shall be created.
 Foreign language calls. The dispatcher will contact the language line for assistance in
processing the call. The dispatcher will give the Agency’s client ID 901104 and specify the
language needing translation.
4. Cancellation. Communications personnel may disregard a wireless or landline 9-1-1 call if there
is evidence that the call is one of the following situations:
 9-1-1 Misdial. A call is classified as a 9-1-1 misdial when the caller stays on the line and
admits to the misdial. No call for service will be created.6
egaP
 Unintentional 9-1-1 call. A call is classified as unintentional when the call taker can hear
conversation, radio, etc. in the background and have listened sufficiently and checked with a
TTY/TDD to determine that there is no indication of an emergency situation. No call for
service will be created.
 Children playing on the phone/ Prank calls. Call takers will call back a suspected prank
caller. Children playing on the phone and prank calls should be treated as a real emergency
until proven otherwise. The called party will be questioned to determine if further action is
needed or a response is required.
 Chronic prank calls. At the call taker’s discretion a call for service may be created using
the CFS type “AID” and call nature of “to dispatch”, to have field units issue an
admonishment to the prank caller.
5. Phase 0, 1 or 2 calls:
When a wireless call is received and distance displayed on the ALI exceeds 50 meters (150 feet)
the call taker shall create a call for service using the call type “W911” and enter the location
information and document the distance in the call narrative. If no sounds of distress or
emergent circumstances are detected by the call taker, the call will be documented and
closed without being dispatched.
When a wireless call is received and distance displayed on the ALI is less than 50 meters (150
feet) a call for service shall be created using the CFS type “W911” and the call taker shall enter the
location information and document the distance in the call narrative. If the call taker is unable to
make contact and verify that no assistance is needed, an officer shall be dispatched for an
area check.
6. Documentation. Call takers will document with whom they spoke, the reason 9-1-1 was dialed
(e.g. nature of the call, or accidental, misdial) and any other explanatory or “intuitive” observations
discerned from the call. A disposition should be added to the call record for statistical analysis and
documentation.
7. Redundant Calls. Redundant calls occur when several calls have been received on the same
incident. The call taker will make sure that the caller is reporting the same incident and not an
unrelated one. Once the call taker is sure that the caller is reporting an incident that has already
been received and any additional pertinent information is obtained, the caller will be advised that
the call information has already been reported. These calls should be disconnected as soon as
possible in order not to tie up any 9 -1-1 lines unnecessarily.7
egaP
EMERGENCY MEDICAL DISPATCH (EMD)
1. Purpose and Scope: The purpose of this procedure is to provide members of the public, when
calling for emergency medical assistance, with first aid pre-arrival instructions that will assist the
victim while waiting for the arrival of emergency first responders. This procedure outlines how callers
are to be connected to qualified dispatchers at the Alameda County Regional Emergency Call Center
(ACRECC) to provide Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD). Emergency Medical Dispatchers (EMD)
do not diagnose medical conditions, nor do they give medical advice. They instead provide basic
instructions over the telephone, following and established protocol, to assist in the care of the patient
until fire and medical personnel arrive. ACRECC has adopted the National Academy of Emergency
Medical Dispatch (NAEMD) as the EMD standard for our service area.
2. Procedure: EMD services are provided by ACRECC dispatchers. Berkeley Public Safety
Dispatchers (PSD’s) shall not give instructions intended to be covered by an EMD dispatcher. The
transfer of an emergency call should be done in accordance with the State Mandatory Standard.
a. State Mandatory Standard: When transferring a 9-1-1 call, the transferring agency should
advise the calling party that the call is being transferred. The transferring agency should
remain on the line until the call has been successfully transitioned to the receiving call taker.
9-1-1 calls may only be transferred once. Should a 9-1-1 call be inadvertently transferred to
the wrong agency, that agency will perform the interrogation and relay the information to the
proper agency. (State of California 9-1-1 Operations Manual Fifth Edition).
3. Call Processing: All calls for medical assistance shall, whenever possible, be immediately
transferred to ACRECC for EMD instructions once the nature and location of the emergency has
been determined. The call taker will enter the appropriate call for service (Police, Fire or both) and
advise the caller that they are being transferred to an Emergency Medical Dispatcher.
a. For in progress crimes the call taker should attempt to obtain nature of crime, suspect
information and scene security information and remain on the line after transferring the call in
order to provide updates as needed.
b. When transferring the call to ACRECC, the call taker will announce the call and if at all
possible, remain on the line and monitor the information in order to update responding Police
and/or Fire units.
a. The announcement should include the following:
This is Berkeley; we are transferring a caller with a medical emergency.
o
State the chief complaint (difficulty breathing, broken leg etc…)
o
Provide the call back number of the caller.
o
c. Should the ACRECC dispatcher obtain relevant information after the call taker has terminated
the call, it is the responsibility of that dispatcher to re-contact BPD and relay the information.
d. If the call is received via a transferable non-9-1-1 line, the call taker shall obtain the location
of the incident and the call back number of the caller in case the transfer does not go through.
The call taker shall transfer the caller to ACRECC using the appropriate emergency seven
digit number, announce the call and follow the procedures as if the call was a 9-1-1 transfer.8
egaP
INTERNET-BASED INCIDENT REPORTING (COPLOGIC) CRITERIA
General Order C-7 Internet-Based Incident Reporting establishes a policy and procedure for the
Department’s internet-based incident reporting system (CopLogic). A main tenement of that General
Order is that our department will remain true to our established value of excellent customer service. This
Captain’s Instruction is effective immediately and is intended to provide further detail on how the
availability of CopLogic will be shared by the Communications Center with community members who are
making a crime or incident report.
The call taker shall use the following criteria to determine if it is appropriate to offer internet-based
reporting:
1. The caller is reporting one or more of the following crimes:
a. Harassing phone calls (PC 653(m))
b. Vehicle tampering (VC 10852)
c. Identity theft (PC 530.5)
d. Theft, petty or grand (484 or 487(a))
NOTE: stolen license plates do not apply, due to the need for an SVS entry
e. Vandalism (PC 594)
2. AND the crime or incident lacks investigative leads and no detailed suspect information is available
3. AND the crime occurred in our jurisdiction (CopLogic reports cannot be entered for Out Aid
type reports)
The call taker shall provide the caller the following information and may use the following script:
“Due to the type of crime and circumstances you are reporting, you may choose to file
a report online. If you choose to file on line, I can email you instructions and a web link
https://www.cityofberkeley.info/onlinereport/ to make the report at your convenience.
You will immediately receive a tracking number and once the report is approved, you
will be emailed a digital copy (usually within 3-4 days).
You may also chose to file a report in person or by phone. If you chose to make the
report in person or by phone, we will dispatch an officer as soon as one is available--
usually within 60 to 90 minutes. You will immediately receive a case number and may
request a copy of the report from our Records department (usually available within 10-
14 days of request). Which option would you prefer?
If the caller would like to make an online report and they meet the criteria above, the call taker can
verbally provide the web link or email instructions as follows:
1. In Outlook, click New (new message)
2. In the From field, type Communications Center (If the From field is not visible, click on Options tab
and click Show From)
3. Enter the recipients email address and then cut and paste the following text into the body of the email:

2. At the discretion of the Off-going team’s Sergeant, the early-out officer may be assigned to take
over or relieve off-going officers on major incidents occurring prior to 0500.
3. Early-out officers will be assigned as cover officers as needed.
4. Unless assigned to a Priority 1 or 2 call, early-out officers are expected to attend their team
briefings.31
egaP
HOLDING CALLS FOR SERVICE
All calls for service will be assigned according to the Standard Order of Assignment Policy and within the
time limits established by the priority code of the call.
1. Calls for service will not be held for an oncoming team unless dispatch is directed to do so by a
Watch Commander, senior sergeant or dispatch supervisor.
2. Holding/Handing calls off due to time of day:
a. Weekend Shifts: If a call assigned within the last two hours of the shift is complex or
extensive in nature, Control will assign the call based the Standard Order of Assignment
Policy and Priority code time limits if the oncoming team’s early-out officer is not
available. Once the early-out officer is available, a field sergeant will determine if the call
will remain with the off-going officer as primary or be handed off to the next team.
b. Weekday Shifts: If a call assigned within the last hour of an off-going team’s shift is
complex or extensive in nature, Control will attempt to utilize off-going officers as cover
units only. If a primary assignment must be made to an off-going officer, a field sergeants
will determine if the call will remain with the off-going officer as primary or be handed off
to either an oncoming team or overlapping team officer.
3. Any direction to hold or hand off a call for an early-out or oncoming beat officer shall be
documented in the narrative of the call and shall include who and why the delay was authorized.
4. Preservation of Available Units: Control will not refrain from dispatching units to calls for service
with the sole intention of retaining available units in the City.
a. Any direction from a field supervisor to hold calls for the purpose of keeping officers
available shall be documented in the narrative of the call and shall include who and why
the delay was authorized.
SITUATIONAL DENIAL/LIMITATION OF SERVICE
1. A Field Supervisor may direct the Communications Center not to take priority 2 cold and lower priority
calls. Dispatchers will provide a brief explanation to reporting parties as to the reason for the denial
or limited service and will advise citizens to call back at a later time to make their report.
a. Examples of when a denial of service may be necessary include: Major incidents,
Protest/Demonstrations, Catastrophic events, Any event which severely impacts the
availability of field units
2. The Communications Center will not deny service for any Priority 1 or Priority 2 calls in
progress or occurring just prior.
3. Cop Logic will continue to be offered to citizens reporting Priority 2 cold reports that meet the criteria
for online reporting.
“CODE 4” ASSIGNMENTS
1. In Progress/ Just Prior Priority 1 and 2 Assignments: Field units must be on scene before
advising “Code 4” after which, any cover unit will be cancelled.
2. Priority 2 Cold calls and Lower calls: The primary officer may acknowledge with their designator
(unit ID) and advise “Code 4”, at which time control will cancel the cover unit(s).
3. Self Initiated Activity: When self-initiating activities (On-views) officers will either advise “code 4”
or Control will dispatch the recommended number of units based on the CFS type of the self-
initiated activity. The cover officer assigned will continue to respond unless the primary officer
advises Code 4.
4. “I’ll advise” and “Code 4 for now” are not acceptable responses and should not be used.41
egaP
FLAT BROADCASTS/ BREAKING AND DIVERTING OFFICERS
The term “flat” refers to a situation where the status board shows there are no available units to assign to
a call for service.
1. Flat Broadcasts are allowed for Priority 1 or Priority 2 in-progress or just prior calls only, for the
purpose of alerting all units of the call.
2. At no time should a call be “flat broadcast” if any units show as available on the status board. If
there are some, but not enough available units, Control will broadcast the call by assigning the
available units and open dispatching for cover unit(s).
Example: “2a14, 2a16 with 1 unit to break and cover, 245 via knife, 2130 Martin Luther King”
3. If there is not a sufficient voluntary response to the flat broadcast, Control shall break or divert the
sufficient number of units to respond to the call. This includes units 10-7, Code 7, 10-19 paper
and those assigned to lower priority calls.
4. Field Supervisors may direct Control to reassign cover assignments to other units at their
discretion. Any direction to do so shall be documented in the narrative and include who directed
the reassignment.
CODE 33’S
1. A Code 33 (Emergency traffic only) may be initiated by field units or Control.
2. If additional information is received after officers arrive on scene that may jeopardize the safety of
a first responder or citizen, Control will initiate a “Code 33” and take the appropriate action of
relaying the additional information and/or getting a “ring” from officers.
3. Under normal circumstances, Control will dispatch all assignments on Channel 1 for the purpose
of Officer Safety and accurate unit status monitoring. When a Code 33 is initiated, the event will
remain on Channel 1.
a. Normal Channel 1 duties will move to Channel 2, until the event is called “Code 4, Code 34”
by a unit on scene. Field units not assigned to the event shall switch to Channel 2 for
assignments while monitoring Channel 1.
4. Field units have the option to ask for a Code 33 on Channel 2.
a. Control will continue normal operations on Channel 1 and a dispatcher assigned to Channel 2
will assume control of the incident on Channel 2.
b. Regular Channel 2 dispatch functions will then be moved to Channel 3 (RB1), until the event
is called “Code 4, Code 34” by a unit on scene.
5. Once the incident is called “Code 4, Code 34” normal traffic will resume on all channels.51
egaP
“THREE TONE ALERT” BROADCASTS
Control will alert all officers of an impending emergency, urgent broadcast, specific crime occurring or
having occurred just prior by initiating the “three tone” alert.
1. Control will press and hold the Alert-3 button until 3 audible beeps are transmitted, then
announce the following information: “Berkeley Units, a _________ (type of incident) via (if
available) In-progress/just prior at _______ (location), still getting further…”
2. Control shall assign the recommended number of units to respond, based on the CFS type
beginning with the Unit who will be assigned as primary, followed by the appropriate the cover
units, if applicable.
a. If the CAD status board does not show enough available units, Control will make the
following announcement: “Berkeley Units (# of units needed to meet recommendation)
are needed to break and respond to the (type of incident) at (location)”.
b. If no unit volunteers to break, the Police Control Dispatcher will break the number of units
required to meet the CFS response recommendation.
3. Non-urgent radio traffic shall cease on activation of a three tone alert, and shall not resume until
the broadcast is complete.
4. Control will continually update responding officers with priority give to information relative to
officer safety, such as weapons, involved vehicles, directions of flight, descriptions and location of
involved parties, or changes to the CFS type and/or time element.
5. Officers should monitor radios at all times, at a volume allowing them to receive the three tone
alert with the exception when doing so would jeopardize the officer’s personal safety or adversely
affect an operational situation.
6. The following CFS types shall be broadcast immediately and shall receive a “three-tone” alert
prior to broadcast if:
a. Based on the information given by the RP, the crime is in-progress or; occurred less than

• Get your map out
• Keep updating directions of travel until we arrive
FIELD UNIT NON-RESPONSE
If a field units cannot be raised on the air after two attempts on Channel 1, Dispatch shall make a
reasonable attempt to locate the unit using the following methods:
1. Attempt to contact the field unit on all radio channels and via the PSB Voycall
2. Dispatch officers to the last known location
3. Attempt to contact the unit by cell phone.
If these efforts are unsuccessful, the Watch Commander will be notified and will determine what further
action will be taken to locate the field unit and ascertain their welfare.
HEIGHTENED OFFICER SAFETY DISPATCH PROTOCOL
At the direction of a Field Supervisor, heightened officer safety field operations may be implemented (i.e.
9 beat configuration, bravo units only, no cancelling of cover prior to arrival, holding of cold calls, etc.) The
activation and de-activation of such operations will be made either verbally on Channel 1 or, by MDT or
telephone, if necessary.
PATROL CODE 7’S
Every effort will be made to ensure that officers can take Code 7 and/or Sports care. All personnel should
be aware that calls must be dispatched within the timeframe established by their priority.
1. Prior to granting Code 7 to an officer, Control will check the CAD status board for any unassigned
calls holding in the Officer’s beat and determine if the call needs to be dispatched to the Officer prior
to Code 7. Priority 1 and 2 calls shall not be held in order to allow an Officer a Code 7.
2. Control will grant Code 7 or Sports Care to a maximum of two officers at a time, per team. A field
supervisor has the ability to grant Code 7 to more than two officers after being apprised by Control of
call volume, officer availability and any other pertinent information.
RADIO CHANNEL ASSIGNMENTS
To ensure that radio operation is effective and efficient while complying with the rules and regulations set
down by the regulating agencies and to acquaint all Berkeley Police personnel with the use of police
radios, radio channels and Federal regulations affecting their use these guidelines are established.
Personnel using any available radio channel will follow procedures as outlined:
1. BPD Channel 1 (BPD 1) is the primary talk group used by the Berkeley Police Department. The
Communications Center will utilize channel 1 to dispatch calls for service to field units. Likewise,
field units will broadcast all self-initiated activity on channel 1, except where doing so will hinder
the safety of personnel.81
egaP
a. When it is determined that there is a need to change channels the selection of a
secondary channel should be made after considering the type of incident involved
and the constraints upon the secondary channel.
2. BPD Channel 2 (BPD 2) is another talk group option to BPD Channel 1, and should be utilized
for non-priority radio traffic, such as non-emergency requests by Patrol (case numbers, tows, call
backs to alarm companies etc…). BPD Channel 2 becomes the primary frequency during a Code
33 on Channel
3. BPD Channel 3 (BPD RB1) is another talk group that is used for non-emergency inquiries on
subjects, vehicles and property. When Channel 2 is being used as the main talk group during a
Code 33 on Channel 1, then Channel 3 will also be used for non-priority radio traffic, such as
non-emergency requests by Patrol.
4. Specialized Talk Groups: There are other talk groups used for specialized events, SEU, DD,
Parking Enforcement etc. These include Channel 4 (TAC 1), Channel 5 (TAC 2), Channel 6
(BPD INV 1), Channel 7 (BPD INV 2), and Channel 8 (BPD PRKG). These channels are
typically not monitored by the Communications Center.
5. BFD Channel 1 (BER1) is the primary talk group utilized by Berkeley Fire Department for calls
for service. There are other talk groups used by BFD which include: BFD Channel 2 (BER2),
BFD Command 11 & 12, BFD TAC 31 & TAC 32
6. Advanced notification to the Communications Center Manager and Dispatch Supervisors should
be made as soon as the scheduled date(s) of a special operation is confirmed. This will allow the
opportunity to appropriately staff the Communications Center to best assist those radio users.
Upon notification of a special operation, arrangements can be made with the Communications
Center Manager to have those channels monitored during their special operation.91
egaP
FIRE DESK OPERATIONS
SCOPE
The function of a Fire Desk Dispatcher is to provide dispatch services by analyzing, prioritizing, and
processing calls while maintaining radio contact with responders to ensure safe, efficient, and effective
responses to requests for fire services, in accordance with local, state, and national standards. A fire
service dispatcher may receive calls for service by incoming telephone calls, CAD incidents, radio traffic,
and other methods.
1. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall be able to analyze radio traffic and calls for service and determine the
appropriate response action.
2. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall accurately create and update the CAD record or incident log, and
maintain accurate call narrative or documentation.
3. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall determine the nature and priority of incidents and assign available
resources accordingly.
4. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall consistently identify, analyze, and relay initial pertinent incident
information to field units as appropriate.
a. The Fire Desk Dispatcher shall obtain verbal or electronic acknowledgement of calls
b. The Fire Desk Dispatcher shall evaluate information and relay updates as appropriate.
c. The Fire Desk Dispatcher shall analyze and disseminate information to additional
responders and resources including, but not limited to: Hazmat teams, Forest Service,
EMS, Law Enforcement, etc.
d. The Fire Desk Dispatcher shall monitor and acknowledge radio traffic on assigned
channels.
e. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall track and document radio activity, incident, and unit
status.
f. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall analyze and evaluate all available information in order
identify the potential for escalation of the incident and perform status checks to determine
scene and responder safety.
g. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall properly process alarm signal tracking notifications,
updates on alarm activity and relay notifications and updates to responding units.
5. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall properly apply Agency notification guidelines to daily operations
and special events.
6. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall cooperate with and coordinate resources as follows:
a. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall proper apply Agency defined mutual aid procedures.
i. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall coordinate assigned radio channels and/or talk
groups,
ii. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall understand and fulfill their role in ICS, NIMS and
state and local emergency operations plans.
b. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall participate in all Agency defined post-incident activities.
7. The Fire Desk dispatcher shall identify and relay pertinent shift activities to dispatchers relieving
them for breaks, shift change or position change.02
egaP
8. The Fire Desk Dispatcher shall comply with regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) that directly apply to public safety radio.
ADDRESSING UNITS ON THE RADIO
1. A standard method for addressing users on the radio shall be strictly adhered to. Communication will
begin with the identifier of the unit being called, followed by the phrase “this is” and the identifier of
your unit.
a. The radio identifier for the Fire Dispatcher shall be “Berkeley” followed by the channel
number. On White Fire 1, the Fire Dispatcher shall be “Berkeley Fire White1”.
2. It is critical for units to use the proper identifier when addressing the Fire Dispatcher on the radio,
especially when the dispatcher is working more than one channel. This permits the dispatcher to
determine which channel the caller is on. Adherence to this procedure will assist the Fire Dispatcher
with utilization of two channels simultaneously, such as the dispatch channel and a TAC channel for a
multi-unit response.
UNIT TRANSMISSIONS TO THE FIRE DISPATCHER
1. Unit messages to the Fire Dispatcher which are of significant length shall be transmitted only after
acknowledgement from the Fire Dispatcher.
a. When traffic is at a low level and the length of a transmission is short, mobile units may
transmit without clearance from the Fire Dispatcher.
b. When transmitting without clearance, the officer must not only be conscious of on-going traffic
but must also assume responsibility that the message was received by the Fire Dispatcher. If they
do not acknowledge the transmission, it should be retransmitted.
c. Signing off is done by the unit which initiated the communication giving its unit identifier and the
word “Clear”
2. Unit to Unit Transmissions may be utilized whenever it will contribute to increased field efficiency.
Before starting transmissions, units shall be alert not to interfere with on-going radio traffic.
3. Acknowledge Messages. “Copy” followed by a repeat of (parroting) the message shall be used to
confirm that a message was understood.
Example:
Medic 5 “Berkeley 1, M5 is third-up at the Drill Tower”
Fire Dispatcher “Copy, M5 third-up at the Drill Tower”
4. Portable Radio Identifier—“X”
To avoid confusion between the apparatus radios and portable radios, portable radio transmissions shall
be followed by the identifier “X’.
Example:
E1 Officer: “Berkeley 1 this is E1-X”12
egaP

Dispatcher shall review the CAD company recommendation for the incident. The Communications
Center may modify the company selection based on additional information or circumstantial factors.
a. Upon acceptance of the company selection for dispatch, the Fire Dispatcher shall initiate the
dispatch through the CAD. CAD will alert the assigned companies by activating the Comtech ring
down paging alert tones.
b. Upon completion of the alerting tone sequence, the Communications Center shall broadcast a
voice dispatch over Berkeley Fire 1 by transmitting the following information:
• Company assignment
• Incident nature
• Location
• Cross-street

information, life safety hazard, potential rescue, information and response by BPD, or multiple callers.
a. When dispatching non-Berkeley Fire resources assigned during the initial dispatch, the
Communications Center shall use the terminology “_____” on order” to indicate that resources
from an agency are being requested as part of the assignment. Examples include: CalFIRE,
PPlus, Oakland Fire.22
egaP
b. When transmitting event types during the initial dispatch, the Communications Center shall
provide a brief description and essential safety information along with the basic event type, when
additional information is known. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:
• “Structure Fire "Apartment on Fire"
• “Investigation "Smell of Smoke"
• Hazardous Condition "Wires down"
• Medical Aid "Shooting"
5. En Route Acknowledgement Companies shall go enroute within 60 seconds or less (NFPA, 2016,
pp. 11-12). If the Communications Center does not receive an “En Route” acknowledgement within
the allotted time, Communications Center shall send the next closest appropriate company and notify
the Battalion Chief.
6. Unit Notifications Companies dispatched as part of an additional alarm, special request or upgrade
of the assignment shall be advised by the Communications Center.
Examples:

7. Descriptors: When transmitting locations, the Communications Center will provide additional
descriptors to the location if the incident involves a commercial occupancy or is in a rural area (Tilden
Park). Descriptors for commercial occupancies should be the occupancy name, such as “Peet’s
Coffee”. Descriptors for rural areas include picnic areas, access roads, and mile approximations.
8. Dispatch Arrival Condition Reports Initial condition radio reports are required to be immediately
voice transmitted on the assigned Command Channel by the first unit arriving on all fires.
a. Follow-up condition reports should be transmitted on the following types of incidents once
information can be determined: Extrication vehicle accidents, rescues, multi-casualty incidents,
hazardous materials incidents, BART incidents
b. Condition reports on routine incidents which assigned companies can handle should be avoided
c. The Communications Center shall acknowledge and parrot the transmitted size- up and condition
reports on Command Channel. This is to insure that all responding companies and command officers
hear the report.
9. Assignment of Command and Tactical Channels to multi-company responses. A command and
tactical channel shall be assigned to the following Call For Service Types: Fire, Extrication
Assignment, Freeway Response, Water Rescue, Rescue, Haz-Mat, BART, MRA, any incident
involving three or more department resources, or at the request of a company or chief officer
10. Monitoring. The Communications Center shall monitor the assigned Command Channel and
assumes the designator of the assigned Command Channel.
11. Acknowledgement: Responding companies shall acknowledge response on the assigned
Command Channel, by transmitting “En Route”. If the unit is equipped with an MDC, the response
acknowledgement shall be made on the MDC.32
egaP
a. First company or chief officer at the scene shall:
1. Transmit a ”condition report”
2. Establish Incident Command
3. Announce that they are switching to the assigned tactical channel once Incident Command
switches to the tactical channel, the responding resources shall switch to the assigned
Tactical Channel.
4. The Fire Dispatcher will monitor but generally not transmit on the assigned tactical channels.
5. Once Incident Command has been established, all radio traffic between incident
management personnel (IC, Divisions, Groups) and resources operating on the incident shall
be conducted on the Tactical Channel.
COMMAND CHANNELS
Command channels shall be assigned by Communications Center for the purpose of communication
between the scene Incident Commander and Communications Center. A command channel is assigned
during any response that require three (3) or more resources. This channel serves as the unified ordering
point and coordination point for the incident.
1. Upon assigning a command channel the Communications Center shall continually monitor the
assigned command channel, until such time the incident is "under control” or the Incident
Commander releases the assigned channels.
2. The assigned command channel shall serve as the travel channel on multi-company
responses until the IC switches to a tactical channel.
3. Any important information gained by the fire dispatcher shall be relayed to responding companies
or Incident Commander on the assigned command channel. Examples include: special access
information, life safety hazard, victims trapped or any other mission critical information.
TACTICAL CHANNELS
Tactical channels are used for communication between incident command personnel and resources
operating on the scene of incidents. They shall be used for the sole purpose of tactical radio traffic and
are not intended to be used for IC to dispatch center communication.
1. A tactical channel shall be assigned by the Communications Center to any response that requires
three or more resources.
2. On large or complex incidents it may be necessary to assign multiple tactical channels. This shall be
requested by the IC to the Communications Center.
3. The assignment of a tactical channel is not necessary for routine incidents such as medical aids, fire
alarms, or vehicle accidents without extrication. “Berkeley 2” may be used for routine unit to unit
radio traffic.42
egaP
COVER-IN
1. A unit, which has been moved-up to cover-in at a station, other than its own, shall retain its normal
radio identifier. For example: If E7 were to cover-in at station 2 and E4 at Station 5 because of a 2nd
alarm, they would maintain their normal identifiers, but they would be dispatched geographically as if
they were E2 and E5.
a. Those engines covering other stations should be put out of service so they are not moved out of
the downtown districts.
2. Request for cover-in by an outside agency shall be made as follows by the Communications Center:
a. To request Albany Fire, call Albany dispatch directly.
b. All other requests for cover-in shall be routed through Alameda County Regional Emergency
Communications Center (ACRECC).
STATUS MODES
1. Companies with MDC’s shall utilize the MDC to status themselves unless responding to outside
agencies. Outside responses shall be updated via radio. MDC statuses for incident responses
include: Enroute, Staging, On Scene, Transport, Arrival at hospital, Available
2. Medic Units shall be assumed to be transporting Code 2 unless the unit specifically advises the Fire
Dispatcher that they are transporting Code 3.
3. Once a company is available from an incident, the company shall update their status with the Fire
Dispatcher using the following MDC status: In Service, Out of Service, Out of Service Training
DISPATCH ORDER MODEL
The order model for radio communications provides a framework for radio traffic. It assures that
messages are understood by providing confirmation. It also provides for effective two-way communication
through the use of a standard radio contact format.
1. Communications shall be regulated by the following (order model) procedures. Sender transmits the
receivers ID and then the senders ID (“hey you, it’s me”).
Example:
“Engine 4” (Receiver),
“Truck 2” (Sender)
2. Receiver transmits their ID to indicate that they are ready to receive the message. “Go ahead” shall
not be used.
Example:
“Engine 4”
Sender re-transmits the receivers ID and then gives the message, in clear text
terminology. “Engine 4, report to Division 2………..”
3. Receiver will acknowledge receipt of the message by a brief restatement of the message (parroting).52
egaP
4. The Fire Dispatcher shall acknowledge all communications directed to him/her by a brief restatement
of the message. Particular attention shall be given to condition reports, updated condition reports,
request for resources and any life safety hazard information.
5. "Copy" shall only be used to acknowledge long, non-emergent messages.
REQUEST CANCELATIONS
Companies ordering the cancelation of other responding companies shall advise the Fire Dispatcher to
cancel a specific company or the balance of the assignment. Examples include, “Berkeley 1”,
The Fire Dispatcher shall transmit companies to “cancel”. When multiple companies are canceled the Fire
Dispatcher shall perform a roll call. Example: “All companies responding to San Pablo can cancel,
acknowledge on Berkeley 1.”
INCIDENT CLOCK
The fire dispatcher shall start an Incident Clock upon the dispatch of structure fire, hazardous materials
incident, or when other conditions appears to be time sensitive or dangerous.1
1. Notification of incident length shall be transmitted to the IC via the Command Channel at 10-minute
increments. No acknowledgement is needed, this communication is one-way. The time notification
shall serve as notice to the IC of condition present and total length of time lapsed.2
2. It is at the discretion of the IC to transmit the incident length information over the assigned tactical
channel.
3. The Incident Clock shall be terminated when incident is declared under control or when the IC
requests the termination of the Incident Clock.
GREATER ALARMS
A greater alarm (2nd or /MASRL1-6) can be requested, by the Incident Commander, during the condition
report or at any time subsequent to the initial condition report. The paramount objective is to efficiently
dispatch and verify greater alarm responses without interfering with tactical communications at the
incident. Greater alarm and full assignments dispatch procedures are identical. The verification of the
units responding can be via MDT or Verbalized on Berkeley channel-1 to reduce the radio traffic on the
tactical channel dedicated to the fire.
1. Pre alert (notification of companies): Select the single tone for three seconds on Channel 1 and
say: “Upgrading the full assignment at 923 Hilldale Ave to a second alarm.”
2. Alert (dispatch of companies): Select the companies due from the run card by clicking on the
Upgrade button within the CFS located in the unit tab (Veh icon). Press “Dispatch” and units are
attached to call. “OR”

• Respond on “Respond on Command (11/12) Tac Channel (31.51.32.52) assigned
• Time Out Time Out (current time) Hours”
The Fire Dispatcher will advise BC2 that the 2nd Alarm companies are responding only after companies
response have been confirmed via CAD or the company (s) has given verbal notification. For that
company (s) who status does not show enroute via CAD or has not given verbal notification the
dispatcher will attempt verification via radio and/or by calling the station. If both attempts fail the
dispatcher shall notify the BC2 and send the next due company
Example: Dispatcher advises BC2 that 2nd Alarm companies are responding on Berkeley Command
(11/12)
Dispatcher: “BC2, all companies are responding to the 2nd Alarm at 923 Hilldale Ave”
Example: Dispatcher unable to verify Engine 7’s response to the assignment

3. 2nd alarm protocol. When the fire desk dispatcher acknowledges a 2nd alarm request he/she shall
assign another dispatcher to dispatch the 2nd alarm.
4. Simultaneous full assignments. When simultaneous full assignments are dispatched, each
assignment shall respond on a separate tactical channel. The initial full assignment shall respond on
initial Command Channel assigned and Tactical Channels assigned and subsequent full assignments
shall respond on the next available Tactical Channel.
Example: Units are working a fire at 2110 Center St. on Berkeley 2. A second structure fire is
reported at 2375 Telegraph Ave. You follow the same dispatch procedure for a full assignment,
but you will announce that this is a second structure fire.
5. Wildland fire plan mutual response agreement with neighboring agencies. This plan addresses
agreements with neighboring fire agencies to provide rapid and direct “Mutual Response” during the
fire season or other periods of critical fire weather. The plan identifies seven (7) areas known as
Mutual Response Areas (MRA). During the declared “Fire Season” or during periods of critical fire
weather any report of a fire in the designated MRA Areas will receive a joint response. The 7 areas
are identified as follows:
1. NORTH BERKELEY MRA
2. CENTRAL BERKELEY MRA
3. SOUTH BERKELEY MRA
4. PANORAMIC MRA
5. OAKLAND MRA72
egaP
6. EBRP MRA
7. SAN PABLO RIDGE MRA
8. MORAGA-ORINDA MRA
It is understood that all fire units responding to a MRA will follow the principles of the Incident
Command System (ICS). The basic concept is for all responding units to operate under a single
“Command” structure. The final supervision of the incident will be handled by the jurisdictional
department, including investigation, reports, etc.
6. MRA radio response. EACH AGENCY WILL FIRST VERIFY THEIR RESPONSE ON THEIR OWN
RADIO FREQUENCY PRIOR TO SWITCHING TO CDF-TAC2
1. Berkeley units will verify response to Berkeley Fire Channel 1 then switch to CDF-TAC2
2. The Communications Center will retain channel priority on Berkeley 1.
3. Because the Communication Center does not have the ability to capability to monitor CDF-TAC2,
the responding Battalion Chief (BC2) will monitor both CDF-TAC2 AND Berkeley Fire Channel 1
for the duration of the incident.
4. When the incident is terminated the Battalion Chief will advise units to return in-service once their
assignment is complete.
5. Fire companies will return to Berkeley Channel 1 and advise the Communications Center of their
in-service status on Berkeley Channel 1.
5150 TRANSPORT POLICY
BPD & Mental Health units must follow the BFD Guidelines and medical criteria attached for 5150 calls
requiring a MED2/5150 transport.
BFD Must respond 1st for a 5150 call if the following applies:
1. Patient is 65yrs or older
2. Violent/Code 3 response needed for the 5150
3. Children 11yrs or younger—they have to be transported to Children’s Hospital
4. Medical Clearance is needed
5. Self-Committal (they are not on a 5150 hold/ they are going voluntarily)
To call PPLUS directly for a 5150/MED2 transport when requested, the incident must meet the
following criteria (ex: when we called AMR directly)
1. Patient is 12-64yrs of age
2. No Medical treatment needed
ALSO NOTE: Calls for a 5150 transport from BART PD, UCPD, CHP ETC, shall follow the same
guidelines as stated above. DO NOT tell these agencies to call PPLUS themselves as BFD
handles their EMS services.82

SECURITY
1. RB1 operators have a responsibility to maintain confidentiality at all times. Dissemination of
information to officers is regulated by DOJ and defined by department policy. Misuse of
confidential records not only violates department policy but also is against the law. The following
are laws relating to CLETS files:
a) 502 PC; Theft, destruction, falsification, removal of in-house computer information
b) 11076 PC; Dissemination of authorized agencies
c) 11078 PC; Listing of agencies to whom information can be released or communicated
d) 11142 PC; Authorized person furnishing records or information to an unauthorized
person
2. Any information accessed through the CLETS system is not for public release.
3. We provide information for Berkeley Police officers; other agencies have their own access and
should not be calling for our records. Note: UCPD will call on their direct line with questions, and
this is acceptable - they have a different switch than we do and their down times are different than
ours.
DEMONSTRATION OR DISPLAY OF RECORDS
1. Actual ("live") records are not to be used for training or demonstration purposes. Most of the
systems in CJIS offer a Test Message Program. This program allows you to perform all of the
functions of a system without jeopardizing "live" records. For information on how to use the
Test Message Program, refer to the section on TEST MESSAGES FOR ON-LINE TRAINING
where examples of test message formats are shown for each of the different systems.
2. Note: Access is defined as the ability to hear or view any information provided
through the CLETS.
3. Once information from the CLETS is in the law enforcement or criminal justice
agency's network, the agency is directly responsible for maintaining the security
and integrity of the data. Any secondary dissemination of the data must be secure
and available only to those who are authorized to receive the data. The law
enforcement or criminal justice agency must comply with the policies and
regulations associated with the release of that data.92
egaP
CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION FROM THE CLETS DATABASE
1. Only authorized law enforcement, criminal justice personnel or their lawfully authorized
designees may use a CLETS terminal. Any information from the CLETS is confidential and for
official use only.
2. Information from the CLETS is on a "right-to-know" and "need-to- know" basis.
3. Authorized personnel shall not inquire into their own record or have someone inquire for
them.
4. Accessing and/or releasing information from the CLETS for non-law enforcement purposes is
prohibited, unless otherwise mandated, and is subject to administrative action and/or criminal
prosecution.
5. The CLETS terminals and information from the CLETS must remain secure from
unauthorized access.
6. Information from the CLETS may be faxed from one secure location to another secure
location. Both the agency faxing the information and the agency receiving the information are
responsible for its security.
7. All information from the CLETS must be stored in a secure and confidential file.
8. When an agency determines information from the CLETS is no longer needed, the data
and/or systems records shall be securely disposed of to prevent access by unauthorized
personnel. Such disposal shall include a method sufficient to preclude recognition or
reconstruction of data and verification that the procedures were successfully completed.
Disposal methods must meet the requirements stated in PPP (Policies, Practices and
Procedures) Section 1.9.11.
9. Information received from a CLETS terminal must be maintained separately from non-law
enforcement information.
10. Terminals must be away from public view with a log on/log off, password process in place.
11. A unique password must be assigned to each CLETS user and must meet the requirements
stated in PPP section 1.9.8
12. Secondary dissemination and remote access to information from the CLETS using
communications media (including the Internet) is allowed when a minimum set of administrative
and technical requirements that include encryption and firewall requirements as specified in PPP
sections 1.9.6 and 1.9.9 is met.03
egaP
LAWS, POLICIES AND RAMIFICATIONS
The use of any CLETS provided information for other than official business may be a violation of Penal
Code Sections 182.1, 502, 11140-11143, 13301-13304 and California Vehicle Code 1808.45
The use of CLETS for other than official law enforcement purposes may result with the employing agency
seeking dismissal and/or prosecution of the employee.
1. In order to maintain the integrity of CLETS and to ensure the security of information received and
transmitted by use of the system, the following policies shall be adhered to:
a. Reasonable measures shall be taken to locate equipment in a secure area to provide
protection from vandalism or sabotage and to preclude access by other than authorized
personnel.
b. Mobile digital terminals (MDTs), cellular phones, and/or radios may be allowed access to
the DOJ criminal history information. Details of summary criminal history may be
transmitted via MDT, cellular phones, and/or radio when a peace officer determines there
is reasonable cause to believe the immediate safety of the officer and/or the public
is at significant risk.
c. Each agency shall ensure the length of such transmissions from the agency to the officer
does not create a potential safety hazard to the officer. The use of such transmissions
and the method of transmission shall be at the discretion of the local agency.
Agencies will be responsible for training officers using the MDT’s when making requests
for criminal history information. Furthermore, the agency must keep an audit trail
(RB1 Log) with justification of the need to know for each inquiry seeking summary
criminal history information and any subsequent third party dissemination of that
information.
2. The Department of Justice conducts routine audits to ensure that criminal offender record
information is used correctly. It obtains a computer printout of requests made at the agency
during a specific time frame, obtains copies of the rap sheets, and verifies that the requests were
made in connection with criminal investigations.
3. If misuse is discovered, it shall be brought to the administrator’s attention. The Department of
Justice requests that disciplinary action be taken and that DOJ be notified of the type of
discipline. If the misuse is severe in nature, authorized persons or agencies may lose direct
access to the criminal offender information maintained by the California Department of Justice.13

DATABASE TRAINING
Training in message formats for access to information in the Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS)
databases, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), National Law Enforcement Telecommunications
System (NLETS), Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and Oregon Law Enforcement Data System
(LEDS) is the responsibility of the Department of Justice. Training will be accomplished according to the
following:
It is the responsibility of all city, county, state, and federal agencies that use information supplied via
CLETS to participate in the Department of Justice's training programs to ensure that all personnel (i.e.
terminal operators, peace officers, investigators, clerical, agency management/supervisors, etc.) are
trained in the operation, policies, and procedures of each file that is accessed or updated. Training shall
be provided only by the Department of Justice's Field Operations Program training staff or another
certified CLETS/NCIC trainer.
Specifically, the training requirements are as follows:
1. The Telecomm Classroom Instructor will train, functionally test, and affirm the proficiency of all
Dispatch Trainees in order to ensure compliance with CLETS/NCIC policies and regulations. This is
accomplished by:
A. The trainee shall complete the CLETS/NCIC Telecommunications (Full Access)
workbook.
B. The trainee must receive a passing score before being placed in the Telecomm
floor training phase.
2. Biennially, the Communications Center Supervisor assigned oversight of Telecomm Operations
shall provide functional retesting, and reaffirm the proficiency of all terminal (equipment) operators
(full access/less than full access) in order to ensure compliance with CLETS/NCIC policies and
regulations.
A. Every Department employee with either full, or less than full access shall complete
the appropriate CLETS/NCIC Telecommunications. Proficiency will be determined by
the trainee’s ability to receive a passing score.23

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES
ABANDONED AUTOMOBILES (1124) WORK FLOW
ENTERING AN ABANDONED AUTO CALL FOR SERVICE
1. Create a NEW call for service (call type 1124)
2. Take info regarding the call as normal (location, RP info, details)
3. Add the auto to the vehicles tab as a Global Vehicle
a. VEHICLE ROLE= ABANDONED
b-. Click the GLOBAL VEHICLE button. Enter the license plate numbe r and
search for the vehicle.
i. If it currently exists in Records, use that vehicle record (update any
new info on the Global Vehicle record
ii. If not, click NEW and create a new vehicle (must have either a FULL
license plate or a VIN to create a new Global Vehicle)
c. If the RP cannot provide either a full license plate or a VIN, note the info in
the call Narrative.
d. Save the vehicle entry
4. Manually assign an incident number
a. ORI = CA0010300
b. INCIDENT TYPE= 1124
5. Clear the call
NOTE: do not enter a disposition. An 1124 call without a disposition is what triggers the
vehicle to display on the daily report. Adding a disposition drops the vehicle from the list.
ORDERING A TOW FOR AN ABANDONED AUTO
1. Conduct a Cleared Call Search for the Incident Number
2. Reactivate the CFS (choose "Follow up" for the reason)
3. Open the CFS and order a tow using the SV Rotation
4. Clear the call and enter a disposition of "TOW"
POINTS OF EMPHASIS
• Always search for the Global Vehicle first and use it; we want to avoid creating
duplicate jackets
• Update Global Vehicles records with new any new information whenever possible:
make, model, model year, color, etc.
• Do your best to obtain a license plate (or VIN) from the reporting party. Entering vague
vehicle info into the call narrative should be at last resort. The daily abandoned auto
report displays global vehicle information. Without it, nothing will print on the report and
the traffic staff must do additional research to locate the information.33
egaP
ALARMS
General: There are two classifications of residential/commercial alarms, each requiring a different type of
response: audible alarms (usually intrusion/burglar alarms) and silent alarms (usually panic, robbery, or
duress alarms). Alarms are typically called in by private alarm monitoring companies on our 7 digit
emergency lines. Citizens may also call reporting alarms that they can hear nearby.
Silent panic/robbery alarms (1033S) are Priority 1 calls, these include bank tracker alarms from Pronet
(1033T) and ESP (1033G).
Audible intrusion alarms (1033A) are Priority 3 calls unless there is some kind of verification of the validity
of the alarm. Verification can be done by either audio or video feedback from inside the premise that
indicates some criminal activity, or on site by a responder, security or citizen that witnesses suspicious
activity, i.e. broken glass, forced entry, or suspicious persons or vehicles in the area. A verified alarm
would be upgraded to a higher priority activity code such as 459.
Vehicle alarms are classified as a 415e unless there are other factors that verify a crime has occurred.
Once an officer has responded to a vehicle alarm and found it to be ringing continuously for 20 minutes,
he/she can tow the vehicle per 22651.5(a) CVC.
Fire alarms are always audible and are Priority 1 calls. They are entered as residential (FA-RES) or
commercial (FA-COM).
Call taker should obtain the following information and record it into the CAD call:
1. The type of alarm.
2. Address of the alarm; and Name of the business, if commercial;
3. Alarm company/RP name and call back number;
4. If the alarm is silent or audible;
5. What area the alarm covers or how it was activated;
6. The premise phone number and if residential last name of resident;
7. If an intrusion alarm, if there is any verification of the validity of the alarm.
8. If a vehicle alarm, description of the vehicle including license plate if possible.
9. Responder name, eta and vehicle description, if available.
Radio
Alarms are dispatched as a 2 unit response. When Officers respond to alarms from a financial institution
that is open or during business hours they will ask for a call to be placed into the bank. The purpose of
the call is to determine the validity of the alarm. If it was a false alarm, an employee will be asked to exit
the building to speak with the officers and the clothing description of that employee should be broadcast.
A 1033T or 1033G activation occurs when money is taken in a bank robbery. The alarm activation is then
tracked by radio frequency or gps. Dispatchers will receive updates on direction of flight via the Pronet
monitor or the ESP link on the computer. This information should then be broadcast to the officers in the
field.
If the alarm company receives verification (proper code) from the business or homeowner that the alarm
is false, they will re-contact the dispatch center with this information. Document this information in the
CAD call. If an officer has been dispatched advise the responding officer that he/she may cancel the
response.
Fire Alarms are dispatched according to the protocols outlined in the Fire Training Manual. If the alarm
company re-contacts the dispatcher to cancel a Fire Alarm, update the responding companies. The
Engine Officer will make the decision to cancel or continue through to the call.43
egaP
ASSAULT
General: An assault occurs when someone intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes injury to another
party. Ascertain quickly if an ambulance is needed. If an ambulance is needed create an additional
medical call for Fire indicating that the scene is not secure and the nature of the injury.
Call taker should obtain the following information and record it into the CAD call:
• Address/location of occurrence
• Time element
• Weapon
• Suspect information and direction of flight
• Injuries
• Drugs or alcohol involved
• Children present or not
• RP information, contact or not
• If the call is in-progress and the caller is not in danger, keep them on the line. If this is not
feasible, have the caller keep an open line as this may assist in getting further information.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALLS
General: The safety of domestic violence victims, whether the threat of violence is immediate or remote,
should be of primary concern, and calls reporting threatened, imminent, or ongoing domestic violence,
and the violation of any protection order, including orders issued pursuant to Penal Code §136.2, and
restraining orders, shall be ranked among the highest priority calls. Penal Code §13702 requires law
enforcement agencies to implement written policies and standards for dispatchers.
Call taker should process calls for service as follows:
1. The dispatcher, when warranted, shall give a domestic violence incident call the same priority as
any other life threatening calls and should, whenever possible, dispatch two officers to the scene.
2. While speaking with a victim of domestic violence the call taker shall not shall discuss the victim’s
desire to “press charges” or “prosecute.” Any comment or statement which suggests placing
responsibility for enforcement action with the victim is inappropriate.
3. During the initial call for assistance, the call taker should attempt to obtain the following
information:
a. Is the suspect under the influence of drugs or alcohol? If yes, what substance?
b. Are children present?
c. Have the police been to this address before? If yes, how many times?
d. Does the victim have a current restraining order?
i. Call takers are not required to verify the validity of the protective order before
responding to the request for assistance63

CALLS FOR SERVICE RELATED TO ENCAMPMENTS
GENERAL
The presence of an established encampment should be treated differently than the report of a
crime, as it requires broader resources across several departments, as opposed to a “simple”
patrol response. It’s vitally important that we respond to these calls consistently, with respect
and professionalism, from call intake at the Comm Center or Front Counter, all the way to
engagement with community members in the field.
CALL TAKER
1. If the call or comment is regarding the presence of and issues related to the existence of
an established encampment BPD staff should:
a. Refer the reporting party to 3-1-1, Berkeley’s Customer Service Center,
where the party may register their complaint or concern; and
b. Explain that:
i. The 3-1-1 Center gathers and reports encampment-related complaints to
the City Manager’s Office, and
ii. Removal of established encampments requires significant resources from
several departments, including a large number of police personnel, and is
coordinated through the City Manager’s office.
2. If the report is regarding a crime, fire or medical issue regardless of whether the suspect
appears to be homeless, or part of an established encampment, BPD staff shall take
action as follows:
a. Officers in the field shall respond to reports as they would with any “flag-down”
report of an in-progress/just prior crime.
b. Dispatchers shall enter calls for service as they would with any crime report, and
dispatch accordingly.
c. As always, community members seeking guidance on when to call BPD
should be advised to call 9-1-1 (for an emergency), or 981-5900 (non-
emergency).
3. Callers reporting resident(s) of Berkeley or Albany who appear to be
experiencing homelessness, vulnerable or in need of services, or individuals who
express a desire for services may be referred to the City’s HOTT team at 510-
981-5273 or HOTT@cityofberkeley.info73

REASSIGNMENT CARD SYSTEM
SCOPE
The Reassignment Card System is the process by which the Communications Center will fill
unexpected staffing vacancies as well as to provide dispatchers a means to change their shift after
the timesheets are established when certain vacancies occur.
PROCEDURE
While the Reassignment Card System is based solely on seniority, in cases of extreme exigency, a
non-seniority based reassignment may be considered after consultation with the Communications
Center Manager, the affected employee's supervisor, and SEIU 1021Union Representatives.
Immediately after the annual timesheets are posted, every dispatcher who has completed the
training program will be afforded the opportunity to fill out two reassignment cards requesting
transfer to other shifts as openings become available. Reassignment cards must be received no
later than 6 weeks before the start of a timesheet. This timeline may be adjusted by the
Communications Center Manager’s provided that all dispatchers received ample notice of the date
change.
From the time the annual shift signup is distributed, to the start of the first (March) timesheet, cards
received will be ranked according to dispatcher's seniority. All cards received after the start of the
timesheet (regardless of seniority ranking) shall be date and time stamped and shall be placed behind
any cards received prior to the start of the timesheet.
Upon determining that openings need to be filled, the Communications Center Manager will utilize the
card system to fill them. The decision as to whether a vacancy has, in fact, been created remains at
the discretion of the Communications Manager, but will be based largely on:
1. The medical opinion of the dispatcher's treating physician, if applicable.
2. The amount of time remaining in the timesheet.
3. The needs of the Department and membership to maintain adequate staffing.
The following rules also apply:
1. Cards will remain in effect until the end of the third (November) timesheet, or until removed (by a
completed transfer, or at the dispatcher's request).
2. Prior to the start of the timesheet, dispatcher's completing reassignment cards shall submit them
(via e-mail) to the assigned Supervisor.
3. After the start of the timesheet of the calendar year, all new cards submitted must be submitted
to the assigned Supervisor via email for date and time stamping.
4. Dispatchers may, at any time during the year, change their reassignment cards(s).The old card
will be discarded. The new card, reflecting the change, will be date and time stamped and
placed in the back of the stack. No more than three active cards per dispatcher may be on
file at any time.34
egaP
5. When a reassignment card is used to fill a vacancy, it is removed from the stack and filed. A
dispatcher, who has made a card move, may not complete a new card for the duration of that
timesheet.
6. A dispatcher will be asked if he/she wishes to move prior to honoring the card request if the
dispatcher chooses not to move, the card request will be discarded.
Filling a vacancy may involve honoring several dispatcher's card requests. Once a permanent
card move is made, it is final. (See exception for temporary card moves under #2 below).
1. In the event that more than one dispatcher's reassignment cards come up during the same
adjustment, only one card can be used. This will allow more dispatchers an opportunity to
move, utilizing the card system.
Example #1- Both a Mid shift and a night shift are available at the exact same time
and one person was the senior person for both of those shifts, then the senior
dispatcher would choose their shift and the second most senior dispatcher would
get the second choice.
2. If there is a temporary vacancy, the Communications Center Manager may offer
a temporary reassignment card move that would be reversed by the return of the
employee that created the temporary vacancy. This situation could occur when an
employee is placed on modified duty or off-duty status for an extended amount of time
due to injury or illness, or administrative leave. The card of the dispatcher who
accepted the temporary reassignment is not discarded and is returned to its previous
position at the end of the temporary assignment.
3. Regardless of the type of card move an employee makes, efforts will be made to
accommodate that employees pre-selected vacation choices. There is no guarantee
that these choices will be honored when moving from one team/shift to another. The
Communications Center Manager will determine whether the vacation choices will be
honored before the move is finalized.
Example #2- Dispatcher A, who works day shift is injured and unable to perform their
normal duties. Dispatcher B works nights but has a reassignment card on file to go to day
shift. Dispatcher C works swing shift and also has a reassignment card on file to go to day
shift. The Communications manager offers Dispatcher B a temporary reassignment card
transfer to day shift because he is senior to Dispatcher C. Dispatcher B does not accept the
temporary transfer, do Dispatcher C is asked. Dispatcher C also refuses, so the temporary
vacancy would be filled by either a trainee recently or eminently completing training, or by
posting of overtime.
Example #3- Dispatcher A is promoted to Supervisor from Day shift, creating an
opening. The Communications Manager determines that a permanent vacancy has
been created. Both Dispatcher B and C have reassignment cards on file for Day shift,
and both are currently on Swing shift. Dispatcher B is senior to Dispatcher C, and is
offered a reassignment to Day shift through the end of third timesheet, but chooses not
to take the transfer, as all of his/her vacation selections will not be available.
Dispatcher C is offered the reassignment to Day shift and accepts the offer. This
creates a permanent vacancy on Swing shift. The reassignment cards will be utilized
again. If no one accepts the reassignment transfer the vacancy would be filled by
either a trainee recently or eminently completing the training program, or by the
posting of overtime.44

ACTING SUPERVISING PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS
SCOPE
To insure there is always someone in charge of the Communications Center; insuring the unit is run in
accordance with its Mission Statement as well as the unit’s Values and Expectations.
PROCEDURE
Whenever a Supervisory Public Safety Dispatcher (SPSD) is not assigned on duty, or when they are on
duty, but unavailable due to ancillary duties, an Acting Supervising Public Safety Dispatcher will assume
supervisory duties. These duties consist of assuming the role of the floor supervisor for the
Communications Center; assuring a focus on the mission and adherence to our values and expectations.
When functioning in the capacity of Acting Supervisor, the Acting Supervisor will have the same
authority as tenured supervisors and should be treated with the same level of respect ,compliance
and cooperation normally due a Supervising Public Safety Dispatcher.
The duties of the Acting Supervisor are as follows:
1. Provide leadership.
2. Ensure the Communications Center is operating under the guidelines set forth in our Mission
Statement as well as the unit’s Values and Expectations.
3. Complete timesheet.
4. Handle all matters concerning the operation of the Communications Center during his/her shift.
5. If the Communications Center is unexpectedly going to be understaffed (below minimum staffing)
then the Acting Supervisor is to arrange for overtime to be sold or to order (hold over or call in)
necessary persons to work.
6. Handle Tier 2 calls as needed.
7. Liaison with the Patrol Watch Commander or Acting Watch Commander as necessary.
8. Document and relay to the SPSD and Communications Manager any problems with personnel
and/or equipments, and contact the appropriate department to have the problem fixed.
9. In the event of an emergency, the Acting Supervisor will send email notifications and be the
liaison between the Communications Center and Patrol/Fire.
10. Complete a daily supervisors log which will include the following:
a) Attendance: personnel on duty, any tardy personnel (including reason for tardiness), as
well as personnel on vacation, sick, FMLA, worker’s comp or Union related absence.
b) Staffing: documentation of any staffing orders (including any refusal of an order) as well
as ride-along’s or recovery time permitted due to overstaffing.
c) Critical incidents/pursuits/shootings/fires
d) Personnel and Equipment related issues: The Acting Supervisor shall be required to
document any behavioral, performance or equipment related issues, as well as any
conversations/interactions with patrol or fire personnel related to their duties as Acting
Supervisor.
e) Give a brief summarization of the day (i.e. was it busy? Slow? Extreme weather
conditions, special events or exercises)94
egaP
In the event that an Acting Supervisor is required, they will be placed into the role for a minimum of five
hours (even if this overlaps with the on-coming or returning SPSD). This shall be noted on the timesheet
so that the Acting Supervisor will be appropriately compensated. It is completely acceptable and routine
for there to be more than one Acting Supervisor on duty at a given time however, only one will be
designated and compensated.. An Acting Supervisor can also be designated as an opportunity for an
SPSD to address outstanding staff work or work associated with their ancillary duties, in which case an
Acting Supervisor would be appointed to cover the floor supervisor responsibilities.
Whenever possible, the duty of an Acting Supervisor will be pre-assigned to a dispatcher who is currently
designated as an Acting Supervising Public Safety Dispatcher. In the event that the pre-assigned Acting
Supervisor is unavailable it will go to the most senior Acting Supervisor on duty. In the event there is no
Acting SPSD on duty, the Senior Public Safety Dispatcher shall assume the duties until they notify the
Watch Commander. The Watch Commander may assign an on-duty patrol sergeant to supervise the
Communications Center until an Acting SPSD, SPSD, or the Communications Center Manager become
available. If they do not, in line with the Incident Command System model, supervisory responsibility will
fall to the Watch Commander, who shall have the option of ordering the senior PSD on duty to carry out
any needs of the Communications Center which may include but will not be limited to ordering of on-
coming or off-going personnel to fulfill minimum staffing requirements.05

of the Communications Center, the Supervisor, Manager or Appointee will first offer, then assign overtime
in the following order:
1. Per Diem Dispatchers
2. Voluntary Standing Overtime Requests (3.25-15 hours) using redline method (PSD's and
SPSD's only)
3. Mandatory Standing 3.25-8 hour overtime using redline method ( all PSD's and SPSD's)
4. Voluntary Non-Standing Overtime Sign-up (OPEN to all including Officers, PEOs)

VOLUNTARY STANDING OVERTIME-15 HOUR MAXIMUM Prior to the beginning of each
timesheet, Dispatchers and Supervisors may submit up to four (4) Voluntary Standing Overtime Request
for a minimum of four (4) and a maximum of fifteen (15) hours each.
Voluntary Standing Overtime requests may be denied or modified due to:
1. Prior disciplinary action resulting in overtime restriction
2. Duty modification due to medical condition or illness
3. Open/Active Worker's Compensation case with duty modification
OVERTIME ASSIGNMENT: The Scheduling Supervisor will assign available overtime based on
standing requests received. The "red line" method will be utilized when more than one Dispatcher or
Supervisor have the same standing overtime request.
MANDATORY STANDING OVERTIME: Effective January 8th, 2017 all Dispatchers and Supervisors
who do not submit a voluntary standing overtime request are required to submit a minimum of 3
mandatory standing overtime preferences. Each preference will be between 3.25 and 8 hours, depending

egaP
supervisors may be assigned non-preferential overtime whenever necessary. The "red line" method will
be utilized to ensure fair rotation.
Any Dispatcher or Supervisor who has failed to submit a mandatory standard overtime preference
will be assigned overtime solely based on the staffing needs of the Communication Center.
GIVING AWAY OR SWAPPING OF MANDATORY OVERTIME: Giving away or swapping
mandatory overtime is allowed. The Supervisory team must be notified via email of the slot giveaway or
swap prior to the Sunday of the week the overtime occurs in. The notification shall include the date and
time period(s) of the giveaway or swap and include the name of both employees involved.
Employees giving away mandatory overtime hours that leave them below the weekly minimum overtime
hours for each dispatcher will be the first to receive mandatory orders that coincide with their workday.
MANDATORY ORDER PROCEDURE FOR UNFORSEEN ABSENCE: When a call off is received
for the team scheduled to relieve a team currently on duty:
1. Using the timesheet and overtime book, the supervisor or actor will immediately perform a staffing
count to determine if the unforeseen absence will affect the minimum staffing requirement.
2. The supervisor or actor will also check the overtime book to determine if the absent employee is
scheduled to work overtime during any period of their absence (i.e., if the employee calls off for
three days, all three days must be reviewed).
3. If the absence effects the minimum staffing requirement the Supervisor or Actor shall:
a. Immediately notify all floor personnel of the call off and ask if anyone is willing to voluntarily
cover all or part of the open shift.
b. If there are no volunteers, the Supervisor or Actor will review the overtime book to determine
if all on-duty dispatchers have met their weekly mandatory overtime requirements.
c. Any dispatchers falling below the weekly mandatory overtime hours shall be ordered first by
reverse seniority.
4. If the Supervisor determines that all on-duty dispatchers have met their week mandatory overtime
requirement, the Supervisor will immediately evaluate their own workload, obligations and project
deadlines to determine if they can fill any or all of the open shift by committing themselves to the
floor.
5. If the Supervisor determines that their workload, supervisory duties or project deadlines will not
allow them to commit to the floor for all or part of the open shift, the Supervisor or Actor will
attempt to contact off-duty personnel and determine if they are willing/able to work the open shift.
6. If the Supervisor is unable to fill the open shift with off duty personnel, a Mandatory order will be
issued. Consideration will be given to the amount of overtime each dispatcher has is scheduled to
work during their current work week. Whenever possible, the employee with the least amount of
overtime hours for their current work week will be ordered.
7. The order will be recorded on the order log sheet in the resource folder for record keeping
purposes.25
egaP
SCHEDULING OVERSIGHTS, OVERTIME NO SHOWS, LATE ARRIVALS
At the very beginning of each shift the supervisor or actor will utilize the timesheet and overtime book to
perform a "roll-call" to confirm all scheduled personnel are present prior to releasing personnel going off
duty. If all scheduled personnel are not present or minimum staffing levels are not met the supervisor or
actor will:
1. The Supervisor or Actor will attempt to contact the scheduled employee.
a. If contact is made, the scheduled employee will give their estimated time of arrival.
b. If the scheduled employee advises they will not be reporting for regular duty, a
reason must be given and an absence slip will be completed by the Supervisor or
Actor.
c. If the scheduled employee advises they will not be reporting for overtime, a reason
must be given and the Supervisor or Actor will complete an No Show for Duty Form
and notify all Supervisors and the Communications Manager via email.
d. If the Supervisor or Actor is unable to contact the scheduled employee, they will
follow the mandatory order procedure to fill the vacancy and complete a No Show for
Duty form. The Supervisor or Actor will notify all supervisors and the Communications
Manager via email as soon as possible.
e. No employee going off duty will be released before the Supervisor or Actor
attempts to contact the scheduled employee.
TARDINESS Employees reporting for duty more than 1hour late for regular duty or overtime during a
calendar year will be subject to progressive discipline.
1st occurance: verbal counseling
2nd occurance: written reprimand
3rd occurance: personnel complaint.
Consideration will be given to acts of nature, weather and traffic related delays or any circumstances
outside of the employee’s control.
CHRONIC TARDINESS: Employees who are chronically tardy (0-59 minutes) will be subject to
progressive discipline. The Supervisor or Actor will document the event in their supervisor log.
NO SHOW FOR DUTY: Failure to report for regular duty or scheduled overtime will result in the
issuance of a personnel complaint.35
egaP
1. If an employee is a "no-show" for scheduled overtime, an employee going off duty will be held
over until the scheduled employee arrives or the Supervisor or Actor is able to fill the vacancy
via alternate means.
2. The supervisor or actor will immediately attempt to contact the scheduled employee. If
contact is made, the supervisor or actor will determine if the employee being held over can be
released or must stay until the scheduled employee arrives. If the supervisor or actor is
unable to make contact with the scheduled employee then the Mandatory Order Procedure
for Unforseen Absence should be followed.
MANDATORY ORDERS: Due to the minimum staffing levels required to operate the Communications
Center, mandatory orders are often necessary to address unforeseen absences and unfilled overtime
slots.
1. Mandatory Orders differ from standing or voluntary overtime in length of notice and
options given to the ordered employee.
2. Mandatory Orders will be assigned based on the staffing needs of the department, with
consideration given to availability of staff and prior overtime and representation commitments.
Available employees who have not met their Mandatory Standing Overtime requirement, or
have given their slot away will be ordered first, whenever possible. Employees previously
assigned both Mandatory Standing and Voluntary Overtime during their work week, will be last
to be ordered, whenever possible.
3. ISSUANCE: Mandatory orders may be assigned by any Communications Center Supervisor,
Acting Supervisor or Communications Manager. In their absence, mandatory orders may be
assigned by the Watch Commander, Senior Sergeant or Operations Division Captain.
MANDATORY ORDER NOTIFICATION: Employees will be notified via City email whenever
mandatory orders are issued.
1. Employees choosing not to check the City email from their personal devices should call the
Communications Center prior to their scheduled return to ensure they have the most up to
date staffing information.
2. Likewise, whenever an order is issued to an off duty employee and the order occurs on the
day they are scheduled to return to duty, the ordering employee should whenever possible,
attempt to contact the employee via phone or text to notify them of the upcoming order.
REFUSAL OF A MANDATORY ORDER: Employees are not allowed to refuse a mandatory order.
Refusal of an order constitutes insubordination and will result in a personnel complaint. In lieu of
refusal, an ordered employee has the following options:
1. Find another employee to take the order
2. Trade orders with another employee
3. Shift flexing may also be approved on a case by case basis and is contingent upon its impact
on the Center’s minimum staffing requirements.
ORDER REFUSAL FORM: When a mandatory order is refused, an Order Refusal Form must be
completed by both the ordering and the refusing employee. When an Acting Supervisor issues an order
that is refused an order refusal form will be completed and forwarded to the Supervisor’s for filing.45

MANUAL DISPATCHING
SCOPE
When the Computer Aided Dispatching System fails, dispatching will be done manually, as outlined in this
section. It is designed to provide a uniform procedure for dispatching during computer aided dispatch
failures.
PROCEDURE
When the CAD System fails the procedures listed below for implementation of the manual dispatching
system will be put into effect:
1. Communications Center will advise all police units of the failure and have them hold all but
emergency traffic until advised. The Watch Commander will be notified as soon as possible and
then determine the need to implement service reductions.
2. The Dispatch Supervisor or Acting Dispatch Supervisor on duty will contact Information
Technology (IT) Department. A callout during non-regular hours is authorized if necessary to
repair the system.

storage location behind console #4. Distribute radio control cards to the consoles.
4. A supervisor may assign one of the backup dispatchers to assist the Control Dispatcher with the
status board and unit status recording. If the CAD screen is still up, attempt to photograph or
take a screen shot to memorialize the units’ activity and location. If the screen is blank attempt to
recreate as closely as possible. Immediately begin a welfare check (rings) of every unit on the
street and record each units activity and location.
5. Once the unit status board is set up and all unit statuses recorded, clear all units for normal
traffic, unless the Watch Commander has deemed it necessary to implement service reductions.
6. When operating on the manual system, the radio cards will be used in the below listed manner:
a. Use white cards for all Police assignments, blue cards for Fire and EMS assignments.
b. Beat- enter the number of the beat where the call for service occurred.

Implement standards of Communications training and evaluation of Public Safety Dispatcher Trainees,
and set forth the selection of members of the Communications Training Team including Communications
Training Officers and Training Supervisors, a formalized Communications Training and Evaluation
Program is established. The purpose of the program is to produce well-qualified Public Safety
Dispatchers, to assign the duties and responsibilities of a Public Safety Dispatcher, and to establish and
define the selection, duties, and responsibilities of Communications Training personnel.
ADMINISTRATION
The program will be administered on a day-to-day basis by members of the Communications Training
Team including all floor Trainers, Supervisors and the Communications Center Manager. Classroom and
floor training will be provided by any member of the Training Team designated to instruct or train a certain
phase or portion. To assist trainee’s in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the importance of the
role of Public Safety Dispatcher’s with regard to the various stakeholders outside of the Communications
Center,
Classroom phases will also include presentations from various departments, including sworn police and
fire personnel, whenever possible.
INSTRUCTION
All instruction will be consistent with and based solely upon the information provided in the
Communications Center Training Manual and Policy & Procedure Manual. Trainers are required to remain
knowledgeable of the content of the both manuals and provide classroom and floor instruction that is
consistent with the standards set forth in both manuals.
A curriculum committee composed of Communications Training Officers and the Communications
Training Supervisor and Communications Center Manager, will be established to ensure the ongoing
validity and relevance of the training materials and formats used in this program.
INSTRUCTIONAL PHASES
Trainees will receive instruction in the five phases: Orientation, Call-taking, RB1, Fire Desk and Police
Desk. A trainee’s performance during this instruction phase will be documented using the following
methods: Daily Training Evaluations (DTE), Coaching Training Report (CTR), Weekly Training Goals.
DAILY TRAINING EVALUATIONS (DTE)
Daily Training Evaluations provide standardized guidelines and should be utilized by trainers to document
a trainee’s performance. During each phase the trainee and trainer should complete daily journals.
Based on the Daily Training Evaluations and journal notes, the trainer will complete a weekly Coaching
Training Report.06
egaP
COACHING TRAINING REPORT (CTR)
An accumulation of a trainee’s progress over a two-week period. This evaluation ties together the daily
evaluations of the trainee for the previous two weeks and documents if the trainee is meeting
performance expectations. CTR’s are to be completed bi-weekly by both the trainer and trainee.
The trainer’s completion of a CTR should be based on the compilation of the following information:
1. Journal notes
2. Daily Training Evaluation
3. Weekly Goals Assessment (met/unmet)
4. Observation of / interaction with the trainer
The trainee’s completion of a CTR should be based on the compilation of the following information:
1. Journal notes
2. Daily Training Evaluation Review
3. Weekly Goals Assessment (met/unmet)
4. Self-Assessment
WEEKLY TRAINING GOALS
Weekly training goals will provide the trainer a clear outline of the teaching topics to cover, as well as
providing performance expectations and focused-based study guidelines to the trainee. At the beginning of
each week, the trainer and trainee will meet and the trainer will explain the weekly training goals to the
trainee, after which both the trainer and trainee will sign the form. The signed form will be given to the
Training Supervisor for placement in the trainee’s file.
EVALUATION / RELEASE FROM TRAINING
Communications Training Officers from the shifts to which trainees are assigned will attend evaluation
sessions as needed to discuss progress and specific problems with the Training Team
While in the evaluation phase the trainee will continue to receive daily and bi-weekly evaluations. It is
imperative to document any areas of weakness, along with the trainees overall performance, on these
evaluations. The Training Officer must take a hard look at the trainee to determine if they can operate as
a viable dispatcher for the department. It is crucial to provide accurate documentation of the trainee’s
progress before releasing them from the training program.
Under normal circumstances, Trainees will not be included in staffing or allowed to work independently
until they successfully complete the training program, including Phase 4, as well as the three-week POST
Certified Dispatcher Academy.16
egaP
Communications Training Officers and trainees will follow the standardized training guidelines
outlined in the Training Program Manual and Testing Material. Training Officers and Trainees will
complete their Daily Evaluations and Bi-weekly CTR’s.
Training Officers will update the Trainee’s Competency Verification checklist with the date and CTO’s
initials, whenever a new training component is:
1. Explained
2. Demonstrated
3. Performed
4. How competency was determined
(a) Observation
(b) Role Play
(c) Written Exam
(d) Verbal Assessment
The responsibility for recommending a trainee’s termination rests with the Communications Team.
Recommendations for release should be substantiated by documentation including Daily Training
Evaluations, Bi-weekly CTRs, and Weekly Training Goals
ASSIGNED TRAINER
If the assigned Communications Training Officer is unavailable to train the trainee due to illness or any
other reason, the Communications Training Supervisor or Communications Manager will assign the
trainee to another trainer. Consideration will be given to the trainee’s current shift and an effort will be
made to place the trainee with another Training Officer on the same shift. If there is not an available
Communications Training Officer on the same shift the trainee will be assigned to an available Training
Officer on a different shift.
COMPLETION OF TRAINING PROGRAM
Successful completion of the training program is defined by the trainee’s ability to successfully demonstrate
proficiency in all phases, including the final evaluation phase. Proficiency must be documented in Daily
Training Evaluations, Coaching Training Reports and Weekly Goal Assessments.
Upon completion of Phase 3 of the training program, a training officer will evaluate the trainee’s ability to
work as an independent dispatcher within the communications team. The Training Officer will be in the
role of an observer/evaluator. During this time the Training Officer will not step in unless there is a liability
or first responder safety issue involved. They will be there to answer questions and continue the training
process, but not to do the work for the trainee. The Training Officer must assess how effectively, safely,
and thoroughly the trainee performs their duties. They must determine if the trainee has retained the
information afforded them during their training, and note any weak areas in their performance. The
Training Officer must develop specific tasks to overcome any areas of deficiency noted, utilizing a work-
sheet if necessary. If the trainee cannot perform at a competent level, a decision will be made whether to
re-phase the trainee or terminate them from the program.26

egaP
COMMUNICATIONS CENTER QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM
SCOPE
The Quality Assurance Program is a standardized form of evaluating employee’s adherence to
established Communications Center operational directives and procedures. The goal of the program is to
provide a system of measurement that both acknowledges exceptional performance as well as capturing
areas needing improvement or remediation. The Quality Assurance Program provides a method to
continuously evaluate the level of service we are providing our customers.
The application for these standards is designed to enhance the quality of each employee’s performance
and improve the procedures used within the daily operations of the Communications Center. The result
will be a team of highly skilled team of professionals that provide excellent customer service to the
internal and external communities we serve.
PROCEDURE
Focused evaluations will be used to routinely examine practices, procedures and operational standards
utilized in the Communication Center. The standards utilized in the Quality Assurance Program will be
based on:
a. NENA Call Taking Standards
b. Departmental Mission, Vision and Values
c. City of Berkeley Customer Service Principals
d. Departmental Policy and Procedures
e. Training Program Instruction
f. Standard Operational Procedures
g. General Orders
h. Police and Administrative Regulations
1. Quality Assurance reviews will be done on a regular basis. These reviews will be used to evaluate
the performance of each employee. In addition to measuring individual performance, focused
reviews will be used to continually evaluate the efficiency of departmental procedures, practices and
training methods.
2. A Random Selection of calls taken by each employee will be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure
compliance with department policies, procedures and standards.
a. Each employee will receive a minimum of two call-taking evaluations, one police radio evaluation
and one fire radio evaluation each month.
b. Evaluations will be performed by the Dispatch Supervisors and Communications Manager In
their capacity as Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs).
c. QAEs will utilize pre-established guidelines for evaluations and objectively evaluate each
employee under their direct command.66
egaP
d. All employees assigned to the Communications Floor will be subject to the same quality
assurance review process, regardless of employment status or job classification.
e. Any Berkeley Police Department employee temporarily re-assigned to, or working overtime on
the Communications Center floor is subject to this quality assurance review process.
f. All telephone calls and radio segments will be reviewed using the QA Evaluation templates.
g. An evaluation form will be completed for each review.
h. Randomly selected telephone calls may be incoming or outgoing, and include high priority (1 and
2 ) calls, business calls, referrals, transfers or out-going calls
i. Randomly selected radio transmissions may include high priority incidents, routine calls for
service and officer initiated activity.
j. The selected calls should be long enough to make a fair assessment of the criteria on the
evaluation form.
k. QA Evaluations must be reviewed with the dispatcher(s) after the evaluation has been
completed. Because timely and beneficial feedback is important, evaluators will meet with the
employee no later than 5 days after completion.
l. All reviews will be stored manually and/or electronically and retained for 2 years.
m. Any dispatcher obtaining a single view score below 80%, may receive additional reviews,
performance goals or improvement plans. QAEs will meet and discuss the area of deficiency and
determine the training necessary to support the employee in attaining proficiency. Any actions
initiated in response to the results will be documented and included as part of the review
n. These reviews can be used to support the development and assessment of goals and
expectations on the dispatcher’s yearly performance appraisals.
CALIBRATION PROCESS
It is important for the success of a QA/QI Program to confirm that QAE’s are consistent, accurate and fair
when evaluating employees. To ensure this, every quarter, the Communications Manager will assign a
single incident to all QAE’s to evaluate independently, to ensure QAE’s are using equal standards of
measurement when performing evaluations.
QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATORS (QAE)
The Quality Assurance Team shall be comprised of the Communications Center Manager and Dispatch
Supervisors. Dispatch Supervisors will be the Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs) and they will be
trained in the area(s) in which they are conducting the review.
The following are the duties and responsibilities of the Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs):
• The QAE will be responsible for the evaluating dispatchers assigned to them.76
egaP
• The QAE shall consistently evaluate calls for service processed by department employees in a
manner that is objective, fair and accurate.
• The QAE will gather the available records (CAD incidents, call notes, recordings etc.) needed to
evaluate all pertinent information and data related to the random sampling of calls for service
being reviewed
• The QAE shall objectively evaluate the information and data, measuring it against the policies
and procedures adopted or defined by the agency
• QAE shall provide timely, accurate and objective feedback
• The QAE will be responsible to generate and disseminate reports as defined by the agency
directive.
FOCUSED EVALUATIONS
Focused Evaluations may be used for the following purposes:
1. Evaluate specific departmental policies, procedures and practices.
2. Evaluate the efficiency of technology or equipment utilized by the Department which may affect a
dispatchers’ performance. An individual dispatcher’s performance is not a consideration in this type of
focused evaluation.
3. Evaluate incidents involving catastrophic loss shall be included in the quality assurance review
process to determine if additional training or changes to procedure are necessary.
4. Identify areas which may require additional or supplemental training and aid in determining whether
certain procedures require modification or change.
5. Any City employee may request a focused review for a specific purpose. Requests must be submitted
via proper chain of command, to the Communications Manager stated below:
a. BPD employees via the Support Services Captain
b. BFD employees via the Battalion Chief
c. Any City Staff directly involved with the incident in review via the Support Service Captain
AREAS REQUIRING QUALITY ASSURANCE REVIEW
1. Call Taking (Telephone Performance).
2. Police Radio Performance
3. Fire Radio Performance
4. Focused (Research and Procedure Review)
Forms:
a. See Evaluation Forms for specific criterion for 1-3 above

egaP
QAE GUIDELINES FOR DATA REVIEW
METHOD FOR GATHERING CALL-TAKER DATA FOR REVIEW
The QAE will use the following method to gather data to evaluate:
1. Each month, the QAE will randomly select two Priority 1 and 2 emergency calls Emergency calls
and non-emergency calls for service for each employee under their direct supervision.
2. The selected calls should be no less than 15 seconds long.
a. NOTE: 911 or W911 hang-up calls or calls not requiring CFS be generated should
not be used for the evaluation process.
3. Once the calls for review have been selected, the evaluator will extract the corresponding
Detailed Call for Service from CAD to review simultaneously.
METHOD FOR GATHERING RADIO DATA FOR REVIEW
The QAE will use the following method to gather data to evaluate:
1. Each month, the QAE will randomly select a portion of each dispatcher’s police and fire radio
transmissions for review, using the Department’s current telephone/ radio recording system.
2. Once transmissions for review have been selected, the evaluator will extract the
corresponding Detailed Call for Service from CAD to review simultaneously.
QAE EVALUATION PROCEDURE: CALL TAKER
The QAE will review all data related to the incident (Incident History and /or Telephone/Radio recordings)
to determine if performance standards were met by noting YES or NO in each rating field.
1. Play the audio recording
2. Review the CAD report
3. Complete the appropriate evaluation form. (Call Taker/Police Radio/Fire Radio)
4. An explanation should be provided for each NO rating
5. Document exceptional performance in the comments section of the review form.
6. Document any areas of deficiency and suggested areas of the remediation in the comments
section of the review form.
7. Document any areas of improvement in the comments section of the review form.
8. An overall summarization of the incident should be noted in the additional comment
section.96
egaP
EMPLOYEE EVALUATION REVIEW
After the evaluations are complete the QAE will meet with the employee within five working days (on shift)
to go over the review findings:
1. Discuss the review with the dispatcher. The dispatcher may note any comments they have on the
review form
2. If a pattern of non-compliant performance is detected in the QAE process, the Shift Supervisor
and the employee will formulate an action plan to improve performance. An action plan is a form
of documented remedial training.
3. If non-compliant performance persists, the area of poor performance may be handled as a
disciplinary issue.
4. Disagreement on reviews will follow the chain of command.
5. A copy of completed and signed forms will be placed in the dispatchers file
COMPLIANT AND NON-COMPLIANT EVALUATIONS
Evaluated employees will be considered either “compliant” or “non-compliant” based on the total
evaluation score:
Compliant: 80% or above
Non-Compliant: 79% or below
If an employee’s performance receives a non-compliant score the QAE will discuss the deficient area(s)
with the dispatcher and provide corrective measures (training, policy or other instructional material)
designed to assist the employee in the deficient area(s).
REMEDIATION AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS
Any employee receiving non-compliant scores for 3 consecutive months will be placed on a remediation
plan.
Any employee receiving non-compliant scores after a remediation plan is in place will be placed on a
Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).
This policy does not exclude disciplinary action when considering individual cases of gross negligence
and/or gross improper behavior or cases of persistent failure to apply corrected policy and procedures;
nor does it exclude any existing disciplinary process.Attachment Berkeley Police Department

PREFACE
As you read this; somewhere in California, alaw enforcement agency is providing mutual aid to
another. Mutual aid is an everyday occurrence in a state as large and diverse as California. This
is the continuation of a Cal OES decades-long process of “neighbor helping neighbor.” The law
enforcement mutual aid system is an ongoing cooperative effort among law enforcement
agencies to ensure an effective and organized response to a wide range of emergencies. There
may be a misconception that mutual aid is used only during a civil unrest and/or natural disaster;
however, this system has been used successfully for many other situations,including large
criminal investigations, deployment of special teams such as Special Weapons and Tactics
Teams, Bomb Squads, etc.
How will your agency use the mutual aid system? Planning, preparation and operational
activities of law enforcement agencies in support of the mutual aid system must be consistent
with each department’s policies and procedures and must also comply with the Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) and the National Incident Management System
(NIMS).
All law enforcement executives, administrators, managers, and field supervisors should
familiarize themselves with this plan and its application. The personnel of the Cal OES Law
Enforcement Branch are available to assist you with planning, training and when necessary,
emergency response coordination. It is important to note that Cal OES does not “own” the
mutual aid system. It is a part of California law enforcement; and those that participate benefit
and share in the concept of “neighbor helping neighbor.”

INTRODUCTION
The Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
This document delineates the current state policy concerning law enforcement mutual aid. It is
consistent with, and describes state law concerning application of the Standardized Emergency
Management System (SEMS) in law enforcement mutual aid situations.
It describes the standard procedures used to acquire law enforcement mutual aid resources and
the method to ensure coordination of law enforcement mutual aid planning and readiness at the
local, state and federal levels.
The law enforcement mutual aid system works best when there is expeditious receipt and
dissemination of law enforcement incident information and situational intelligence related to
unusual occurrences.
This document includes information regarding the statutory protections afforded responders
under the Emergency Services Act, and provides legal background for law enforcement mutual
aid.
New in this Revision
This edition takes the basic information included in prior versions and formats it in a more
complete and usable manner. No changes have been made to the system, organizational
relationships or the process. What follows is perhaps a more useful explanation of the process.
Updated information on the Law Enforcement Branch and its resources is included; as is updated
information on state agencies that routinely provide law enforcement mutual aid. Lastly, a
compendium of legal sections has been added. While this is not meant to be exhaustive, it will
provide easy access to key sections of law dealing with these issues.
Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch
The Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch functions behind the scenes to maintain the Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid System in California. Our peace officers can assist any California law
enforcement organization in developing related plans, training, and exercises for their agency.
The Branch welcomes input on the Mutual Aid System and suggestions for improvement of this
plan, or emergency operations in general.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

HISTORY AND AUTHORITY
The Law Enforcement Mutual Aid system has been used successfully for many years. Notable
events involving use of this system include:
 Northern California Floods
 Firestorms of 2003, 2007
 Transportation accidents, air crashes
 Watts Riots
 People’s Park – Berkeley Civil Unrest
 Huntington Beach “Surf” Riot
 Loma Prieta Earthquake

The statewide mutual aid system today is an outgrowth of the California Disaster and Civil
Defense and the Master Mutual Aid Agreement (1950), the Emergency Services Act, Chapter 7
of Division 1 of Title 2 of the Government Code (GC), Governor’s Executive Order W-9-91, is
supported by the California Emergency Plan and by extension, the Law Enforcement Mutual Aid
Plan.
The State of California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan is issued and revised under the
authority of Sections 8550, 8569, 8615 through 8619, and 8668 of the California Government
Code, the California Emergency Plan, and the Master Mutual Aid Agreement.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 6
LIABILITY ISSUES
The Emergency Services Act (the Act) provides law enforcement agencies limited immunity
from liability when responding in support of a mutual aid request.1 Albeit “limited,” when
interpreting the immunity protections provided by the Act, the courts have regularly found that if
the “state must take the steps necessary to quell an emergency, it must be able to act with speed
and confidence without fear of incurring tort liability.”2
Therefore; the Act’s immunities are broader than the general immunities provided for
discretionary governmental actions, i.e., for decisions made by the high ranking officers, the City
Council, or Board of Supervisors regarding policy matters. 3 Also, the protections afforded by
the Act generally supplement the other statutory liability protections that may apply to the
routine law enforcement role, such as immunities for failure to enforce the law.4,5 The liability
protections of the Act extend to mutual aid provided during a declared state of emergency 6 and
non-emergency periods.7
The best way that a law enforcement agency can assurethat its actions are protected by the Act is
to:
 Act in accordance with this plan,
 Respond based upon a request by the Operational Area, Regional, or State Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator,
 Act in accordance with your local emergency plan approved by the local disaster council
in accordance with local ordinance, and
 Verify that your department’s plans and procedures are consistent with this plan.8

DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS
Note: Some definitions are not verbatim text from related codes and regulations, but are
paraphrased for clear understanding of the concepts involved.
Operational Area
A county, along with all the political subdivisions within that county constitutes an Operational
Area.
Operational Area Law Enforcement Coordinator
The county sheriff is the Operational Area law enforcement coordinator, with the exception of
the City and County of San Francisco, where the chief of police is the Operational Area Law
Enforcement Coordinator.
Mutual Aid Region
A Mutual Aid Region is a geographic area comprised of multiple operational areas. A Mutual
Aid Region manages and coordinates information and resources among operational areas within
the mutual aid region and between the Operational Areas and the state level.
Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator
A Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator is an Operational Area Law Enforcement
Coordinator elected by peers from within the mutual aid Region, to coordinate the collective law
enforcement mutual aid response of agencies within the Region.
State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator
The State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator is the Chief of the Law Enforcement
Branch of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES). The state
coordinator is responsible for mutual aid response coordination and administrative interaction
between state and local law enforcement agencies during emergency and non-emergency
situations, where the mutual aid system is, or could be, involved.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 8
State of War Emergency
"State of War Emergency" means the condition which exists immediately, with or without a
proclamation thereof by the Governor, whenever this state or nation is attacked by an enemy of
the United States, or upon receipt by the state of a warning from the federal government
indicating that such an enemy attack is probable or imminent. (Section 8558 (a) GC)
During a state of war emergency, the Governor has complete authority over all agencies of state
government and the right to exercise within the area or regions designated, all police power
vested in the state by the Constitution and laws of the State of California (GC, Article 12,
Section 8620 and Article 13, Section 8627, “California Emergency Services Act”). During a
state of war emergency, mutual aid is mandatory. (Discussed later in the Plan.)
State of Emergency
"State of Emergency" means the duly proclaimed existence of conditions of disaster or of
extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state caused by such conditions as
air pollution, fire, flood, storm, epidemic, riot, drought, sudden and severe energy shortage, plant
or animal infestation or disease, the Governor's warning of an earthquake or volcanic prediction,
or an earthquake, complications resulting from the Year 2000 Problem, or other conditions, other
than conditions resulting from a labor controversy or conditions causing a "state of war
emergency," which, by reason of their magnitude, are or are likely to be beyond the control of
the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of any single county, city and county, or city
and require the combined forces of a mutual aid region or regions to combat, or with respect to
regulated energy utilities, a sudden and severe energy shortage requires extraordinary measures
beyond the authority vested in the California Public Utilities Commission. (Section 8558
(b)(GC))
During a state of emergency, the Governor has complete authority over all agencies of state
government and the right to exercise within the area or regions designated, all police power
vested in the state by the Constitution and laws of the State of California (GC, Article 12,
Section 8620 and Article 13, Section 8627, “California Emergency Services Act”). During a state
of emergency,mutual aid is mandatory. (Discussed later in the Plan)Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 9
Local Emergency
"Local Emergency" means the duly proclaimed existence of conditions of disaster or of extreme
peril to the safety of persons and property within the territorial limits of a county, city and
county, or city, caused by such conditions as air pollution, fire, flood, storm, epidemic, riot,
drought, sudden and severe energy shortage, plant or animal infestation or disease, the
Governor's warning of an earthquake or volcanic prediction, or an earthquake, complications
resulting from the Year 2000 Problem, or other conditions, other than conditions resulting from a
labor controversy, which are or are likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel,
equipment, and facilities of that political subdivision and require the combined forces of other
political subdivisions to combat, or with respect to regulated energy utilities, a sudden and severe
energy shortage requires extraordinary measures beyond the authority vested in the California
Public Utilities Commission. (Section 8558(c), GC).
In periods of local emergency, political subdivisions (cities or counties) have the power to
provide mutual aid to any affected area in accordance with local ordinances, resolutions, plans,
or agreements. (It could be argued that having signed the Master Mutual Aid Agreement, the
entity is bound to provide resources, if requested in accordance with the Mutual Aid Plan.)
During a local emergency, state agencies may provide mutual aid; including personnel,
equipment, and other available resources, to assist local jurisdictions in accordance with mutual
aid plans or at the direction of the Governor.
By proclaiming a local emergency, the governing body of a city or county expands its regulatory
enforcement subject to constitutional constraints, increases its police power and may promulgate
temporary emergency orders and regulations necessary to provide for the protection of life and
property.
Response costs are absorbed by the responding agency notwithstanding any other agreements to
the contrary, or availability of disaster reimbursement funds from another source.
A Proclamation of Local Emergency is not required before requesting law enforcement
mutual aid.
Unusual Occurrence
An unusual occurrence is an event involving potential or actual personal injury or property
damage arising from incidents such as natural and manmade disasters, acts of terrorism, and civil
unrest.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 10
Fifty Percent Guideline
No jurisdiction is required to unnecessarily deplete its own personnel, equipment and service
capabilities in order to furnish mutual aid resources. When requested to provide mutual aid, it is
generally accepted that a reasonable response will consist of up to 50% of available on-duty
uniformed personnel.
Law Enforcement Branch
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services Law Enforcement Branch (Cal OES
LEB) is the state facilitator of inter-regional law enforcement mutual aid response resources to
operational areas. The Law Enforcement Branch also provides ongoing liaison with operational
areas, municipalities, and state and federal agencies during non-emergency periods to facilitate
emergency preparedness planning and mutual aid awareness training. The branch also
coordinates the state’s search and rescue and coroner/medical examiner mutual aid programs, as
well as other activities in support of local law enforcement mutual aid response. Additional
information follows later in this plan.
Mission Numbers
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, Law Enforcement Branch, assigns Cal
OES law enforcement mission numbers to track law enforcement mutual aid resources
responding from outside the requesting Operational or Regional Area jurisdiction.
This most frequently occurs during searches and rescues involving registered Disaster Service
Workers (volunteers) to ensure workers compensation coverage.
Search and Rescue incidents are recognized as an emergency, often requiring specialized
resources from various parts of the state. A majority of SAR responders are volunteer
professionals. It is recommended that any out-of-county SAR mutual aid mission requests be
routed directly to Cal OES LEBfor the assigning of a state mission number. This facilitates
immediate Statewide SAR Mutual Aid (as defined in the SAR Annex), and identifies the
existence of an authorized state mutual aid mission providing Disaster Service Worker (DSW)
coverage for properly registered volunteer personnel.
Normal Law Enforcement Mutual Aid within a Region does not requireaCal OES Mission
numberalthough; mission numbers may also be issued at the request of the Regional Law
Coordinator. Iflaw enforcement resources (in the form of mutual aid) respond outside of their
Region (SWAT from a county in Region 4 being requested by a County in Region 3) the Law
Branch will issue a mission number and track thoseresponding resources until the operation has
concluded.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 11
Mission Numbers (Cont.)
If a county within a region desires to have a Cal OES Law Mission number issued for
county-to-county mutual aid requests,the request must be directed to the Regional Mutual Aid
Coordinator (RMAC)for approval. Upon approval, the RMAC coordinator will contact the
Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch Duty Officer and request that a mission number be issued.
Any request for law enforcement mutual aid outside of the originating region must have the
approval of and be coordinated by the Regional Mutual Aid Coordinator.
The existence of a law enforcement mission number also implies that the law enforcement duty
officer queried the requestor to insure that mutual aid criteria weremet prior to tasking an
out-of-county mutual aid response.
It is suggested that any county routinely providinglaw enforcement mutual aid (typically a
specialized resource, i.e. Bomb squad, SWAT) to another county within its region develop an
internal “unusual occurrence” numbering system to document each deployment.
Mission numbers are not a mechanism to assure reimbursement of response costs, theyare a
database tracking tool to memorialize a mutual aid incident and its disposition.
A CalOES law enforcement mission number consists of three parts: the year (e.g. 2009), the
letters “LAW” followed by a four digit sequential number, e.g. 2009-LAW0123.
Day-to-Day Mutual Aid
During the course of normal law enforcement smaller incidents occur that may require
immediate assistance, such as: back-up on a traffic stop, perimeter control for a fleeing suspect
or crowd control at a barricaded suspect location pending the arrival of additional local
resources. Officers from nearby jurisdictions may respond to these emergency broadcasts on
their own initiative (department policy permitting) without a formal mutual aid request.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 12
LEVELS OF MUTUAL AID
Mutual aid response within the State of California is based on four governmental levels of
increasingly justifiable mutual aid support. These levels are cities (or other similar local
jurisdictions), operational areas, mutual aid regions, and the state.
Note: Throughout this segment of the Mutual Aid Plan, the terms chief of police/sheriff are used
as the initiators of a mutual aid request. The volatility of some incidents necessitates immediate
support. In fact, any designated command, management or supervisory-level officer/ deputy has
the ability to request, or provide, law enforcement mutual aid on behalf of the chief/ sheriff, if so
authorized by agencypolicy.
City
City police departments are charged with responsibility for the maintenance of law and order and
protection of life and property within the municipal geographic boundaries.
The chief of police is the official responsible for determining the magnitude of a law
enforcement emergency within the jurisdiction, the extent of locally committed resources and the
necessity for requesting law enforcement mutual aid. In a contract city, the command-level
manager from the contracted agency functions much as does a local chief.
Operational Area
The Operational Area (county sheriff) is the next level of law enforcement mutual aid
responsibility (See Operational Area map). The Operational Area is a composite of its political
subdivisions, i.e., municipalities, contract cities, special districts and county agencies. The
county sheriff is the Operational Area Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator (or, in the case
of San Francisco, the chief of police of the city and county of San Francisco).
Region
To facilitate coordination of mutual aid, the State of California is geographically divided into
seven law enforcement mutual aid Regions (See Mutual Aid Regional map). Each mutual aid
Region is comprised of multiple Operational Areas and has a Regional Law Enforcement Mutual
Aid Coordinator.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 13
The Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator is granted the authority to coordinate
the mutual aid response of law enforcement resources within the Region to support a mutual aid
request from a jurisdiction within the Region. Requests for mutual aid resources between
Regions are coordinated by the Chief of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency
Services, Law Enforcement Branch.
The Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator is a sheriff from within the Region who
is elected to the position by majority vote of the other Sheriff’s of that Region. [See the appendix
that describes this process.]
Note: Coroner’s mutual aid is coordinated in the same manner as law enforcement mutual aid
beginning at the Operational Area level. See the Cal OES companion document that describes
Coroner/Medical Examiner Mutual Aid for further detail.
State
On behalf of the Governor, the Director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency
Services, through the Chief of the Law Enforcement Branch, has the responsibility for
coordination of state law enforcement mutual aid resources in support of local jurisdictions
during times of emergency. Information on the resources available from state agencies appears
later in this plan.
A number of state law enforcement agencies offer assistance on an “immediate need” basis –
much as exists in “day-to-day” mutual aid response situations. Nothing in this plan should be
construed to limit this process. Indeed, it is consistent with this plan. Use of state law
enforcement resources for mutual aid beyond that level should, however, be coordinated through
the Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch.
Federal
The Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch can also assist a local agency in seeking the assistance of
federal law enforcement agencies or resources. Our peace officers can assist local law
enforcement organizations with requests to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US
Department of Justice, or other agencies. In some cases, federal reimbursement for response
costs is available through these agencies –again accessed through Cal OES Law Enforcement
Branch.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 14Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 15
MUTUAL AID PROCEDURES
Note: Throughout this segment of the Mutual Aid Plan, the terms chief of police/sheriff are used
as the initiators of a mutual aid request. The volatility of some police incidents necessitates
immediate support. In fact, any designated command, management or supervisory-level officer/
deputy has the ability to request, or provide, law enforcement mutual aid on behalf of the chief/
sheriff, if so authorized by agency policy.
Local Request for Mutual Aid
When a chief of police of a local jurisdiction (or the sheriff, acting as chief law enforcement
officer for the unincorporated or a contract area) determines that an unusual occurrence may
become or is already beyond the control of local law enforcement resources, it is the chief’s (or
duly authorized representative’s) responsibility to request mutual aid from the Operational Area
Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator.
A declaration of local emergency may or may not be appropriate for the circumstances; however
the chief of police may request mutual aid prior to the activation of an EOC or formal declaration
of local emergency. Mutual aid request and response is not dependent on a declaration of local
emergency.
Operational Area Mutual Aid
When an emergency develops or appears to be developing which cannot be resolved by a law
enforcement agency within an Operational Area, it is the responsibility of the Operational Area
Mutual Aid Coordinator to provide assistance and coordination to control the problem. (Section
26602 GC)
In response to a request for law enforcement mutual aid by a chief of police within the
Operational Area, the sheriff will initiate procedures to activate the mutual aid. The sheriff will
coordinate the Operational Area response of law enforcement resources including those of
unaffected operational area municipalities, the local CHP, and other law enforcement agencies
within the Operational Area, as well as the sheriff’s resources in order to assist the affected local
chief of police.
If it appears likely that the resources of an Operational Area will become depleted, the Regional
Coordinator should be advised in advance.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 16
Regional Mutual Aid
Should an existing or anticipated emergency be of such magnitude as to require the commitment
of the resources of one or more Operational Areas, it is the responsibility of the Regional Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator to organize the notification and response of resources
within that region.
The Regional Coordinator will keep the State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator, who is
the Chief of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, Law Enforcement Branch,
advised of the situation status. The State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator may support
the regional response by issuing mission numbers (see glossary, Mission Numbers) and tasking
state agencies within the region. An unusual occurrence necessitating regional law enforcement
mutual aid does not require a proclamation of a state of emergency.
Statewide Mutual Aid
If the combined resources of a region are not sufficient to cope with an emergency situation, the
Regional Coordinator may request additional assistance through the State Law Enforcement
Mutual Aid Coordinator. The State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator may then task law
enforcement resources from Regions statewide, via the Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid
Coordinators, to assist.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

PRACTICAL ISSUES
Mutual Aid Essentials
Reasonable commitment of local law enforcement resources prior to the initiation of a mutual aid
request is a fundamental component of mutual aid operations. This does not require the
jurisdiction to have expended all personnel resources, but does assume that the agency has
reasonably committed the majority of available, on-duty personnel or resources to the incident.
A request for law enforcement mutual aid requires the approval of the chief law enforcement
officer of the requesting jurisdiction. A duly authorized sworn staff or command officer acting
on behalf of the chief/sheriff may make the request.
Unless otherwise expressly provided, or later agreed upon, the responsible local law enforcement
official of the jurisdiction requesting mutual aid shall remain in charge. It is operationally
essential that the local law enforcement official coordinate all actions with responding law
enforcement agencies to ensure an effective application of forces (8618 GC).
The integrity of responding forces and the policies and procedures of their departments must be
maintained. Exceptions will require approval of the concerned department. Refer to the Law
Enforcement Guide for Emergency Operations for further policy guidance.
Situation reports should be shared with all interested parties and agencies, including the Regional
Coordinator and the Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch on a timely and frequent basis.
The agency requesting mutual aid is responsible for the following:
1. Identifying numbers and types of mutual aid resources requested.
2. Identifying specific missions for mutual aid responder tasking.
3. Advising responders what equipment they should bring.
4. Establishing an assembly area for responding resources.
5. Identifying communications channels compatible with command and control of field
resources.
6. Designating a liaison officer to facilitate a coordinated assimilation of responding mutual
aid resources.
7. Preparing a situation briefing including local maps for responders.
8. Providing logistical support such as food, lodging, rest intervals and equipment
maintenance as appropriate, for mutual aid personnel. (Cont)Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 19
PRACTICAL ISSUES (Cont):
The responding agency is responsible for the following:
1. Properly equipping its personnel.
2. When possible, assigning a supervisor to maintain unit integrity.
3. Completing response rosters.
4. Dispatching personnel to the staging area.
5. Providing relief for assigned personnel at protracted events.
6. Record keeping as to dates and times of arrival and departure, rank, timekeeping,
mileage, damage and expended resources.
Mutual Aid within SEMS
Mutual Aid is intended to augment local resources that have become overwhelmed as a result of
unplanned circumstances requiring an emergency response. In California the organizational
structure adopted to manage responding resources for all disciplines is the Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS). SEMS includes the field level Incident Command
System (ICS). (8607 GC)
Incident Command
For a detailed description of the Law Enforcement Incident Command System (LEICS)
including mutual aid operational procedures, it is recommended that the Law Enforcement Guide
for Emergency Operations be reviewed. The five command staff functions of Incident
Commander, Operations, Planning/Intelligence, Logistics, Finance/Administration and their
subordinate components are discussed in detail.
Planned Events
Planned events are not mutual aid incidents for planning purposes. Scheduled events that by their
nature are potentially beyond the ability of local control require the affected jurisdiction, as a
matter of responsible planning, to meet with the promoters, the sheriff and any other appropriate
government entity to ensure that the law enforcement presence is adequate and that public safety
is protected. Such planning may result in a Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] or contract
between the local government hosting the event, specific law enforcement agencies involved and
the event promoter.
The mutual aid system is not intended to prevent MOU agreements between concerned parties to
ensure an adequate law enforcement presence. Policing costs are frequently recovered through
event revenues and this should be considered during the planning process. (Cont)Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 20
PRACTICAL ISSUES (Cont):
Even with adequate planning, some events are inherently more likely than others to develop into
an unusual occurrence. During the planning process, it is not only appropriate but recommended
that the mutual aid organization be alerted to this potential. By doing so, those agencies which
can be expected to provide support in such an eventuality will be afforded the opportunity to plan
and deploy accordingly during the dates of the event. Proper planning will ensure an optimum
mutual aid response should it become necessary.
It is recommended that the pre-event planning participants be organized according to the SEMS
organization structure. By doing so, each entity can see exactly where it fits in a well defined
organizational relationship. At multi-agency events, all levels of event staffing must be
knowledgeable of the command hierarchy. If addressed prior to the event, it minimizes confusion
and createsa seamless transition from planning to operations.
These things having been said, an unforeseen emergency may occur at a planned event that
results in a mutual aid response. Mutual aid does not occur until the local law enforcement
authority with jurisdiction determines that an emergency is in progress, that local resources have
been reasonably committed or are unavailable and mutual aid assistance is required to restore the
peace.
Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch personnel are available for event planning consultation and
will staff appropriate positions during the event to facilitate mutual aid response and ensure that
the Governor’s office is appraised of situational developments. Some events will be of a nature
that the federal government will declare them National Security Special Events [NSSE]. In these
cases, the US Secret Service will convene a multi-agency planning team, to include local law
enforcement. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also assigns Special Event Response Levels
[SERL] to certain events. Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch staff can describe the NSSE and
SERL processes, and put local law enforcement officials in touch with appropriate officials for
further information.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 21
Reserve Officers
Mutual Aid normally consists of sworn officers, technical personnel (sworn and non-sworn) and
other resources. Many agencies use reserve officers to augment local field policing. In a law
enforcement mutual aid response, reserve officers may best be utilized within their own
jurisdiction to backfill vacant positions created by regular officers who have been deployed to
the emergency jurisdiction.
Those concerns notwithstanding, reserve officers, as defined by California Penal Code 830.6 (a)
1 & 2 and 836.2, as employed by a law enforcement agency authorized to field reserve officers,
may be utilized to enforce the law anywhere in the State of California.
Communications
An essential need during any emergency is the ability of an agency to communicate both
internally and with other agencies. With this requirement in mind, the problem of
communications should be a priority in mutual aid planning before an incident occurs.
The State of California has established the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Radio
System (CLEMARS) with special frequencies for emergency law enforcement mutual aid
purposes. For a detailed description of the California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Radio
System, it is recommended that the CLEMARS Plan be reviewed. This system is intended for
command and control purposes among agencies taking part in emergency operations. It is not to
be used as a primary local channel. Local departments may be allowed to use these channels in
theirday-to-day operations as an auxiliary to their primary frequency upon approved request.
In addition to CLEMARS, Cal OES Telecommunications is able to deploy interoperability
communications vehicles to incident command posts. These vehicles are capable of coordinating
dissimilar radio frequencies to facilitate communications among responding agencies.
Cal OES Telecommunications is also able to deploy satellite trailers to an Incident Command
Post that will permit a combination of up to ten satellite data and telephone links, even in remote
areas.
The Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch maintains a cache of handheld radios that are available
to law enforcement agencies for emergency deployment. These radios are programmable in the
UHF and VHF frequency ranges. Caches of encrypted radios for sensitive situations,
investigations or incidents are also available.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 22
Financial Assistance
Law enforcement agencies may be eligible for disaster related financial reimbursement from the
state and/or federal government. State financial assistance may occur through the California
Disaster Assistance Act (8680 through 8692 GC) when the Governor proclaims a state of
emergency. Federal financial assistance may occur under Public Law 93-288 as amended by the
Stafford Act. This requires a Presidential declaration of major disaster.
The Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) program was enacted to ensure that adequate
resources are available to control a fire incident before a major disaster occurs. FMAG
assistance must be requested by the local fire agency, through Cal EMA, and approved by
FEMA while the fire is burning uncontrolled and threatens such destruction as would constitute a
major disaster. If an FMAG is approved by FEMA, seventy five percent of direct emergency
response costs, including local law enforcement, may be eligible for federal reimbursement.
Authority for this program can be found in 44 CFR Parts 2, 9, 10, 204, and 206, The Fire
Management Assistance Grant Program, and in Public Law 106-390, the Disaster Mitigation Act
of 2000. Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch staff can advise and assist if a local agency wishes
to file a claim for these funds.
Should these proclamations occur, local agencies may be eligible for financial assistance to
reimburse a percentage of response costs (i.e., overtime, mileage, etc.), and restoration and
reconstruction costs for damage to agency facilities.
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services Recovery Branch administers both
state and federal claims for disaster assistance as a part of the state’s disaster recovery program.
Briefings on program eligibility are conducted periodically and immediately following disaster
proclamations or declarations. Auditors from the State Controller's Office are also available at
those briefings to assist agency personnel in documenting costs and identifying necessary
records.
Claims for reimbursement must withstand future state/federal audits, or funds advanced as part
of the initial assessment must be returned. Therefore, all responding law enforcement agencies
should keep accurate and complete records concerning personnel timekeeping, mission tasking
and resource expenditures during the period of any incident that may become eligible for future
reimbursement. (Cont)Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 23
Financial Assistance (Cont)
An additional federal program, the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Act
(EFLEA) administered through the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)
can assist state and local law enforcement agencies with funding, equipment, training,
intelligence information, and personnel to help alleviate emergency situations. The program is
not intended to be a routine source of federal financial assistance for criminal justice activities.
Detailed information about EFLEA may be found at Title 28, CFR, Chapter 1, Part 65. It is
codified at Title 42, USC, Section 10501. For details contact the Cal OES Law Enforcement
Branch.
This document does not discuss other grant programs for preparedness activities such as those
involving funds for terrorism equipment, training, and exercises. Contact the Cal OES Law
Enforcement Branch for information about these programs.
Interstate Assistance
In accordance with the Interstate Civil Defense and Disaster Compact as the basis for mutual aid
between states; the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services entered into a
Memoranda of Agreement with the neighboring states of Oregon, Nevada and Arizona for law
enforcement mutual aid under certain conditions. Most frequently, this form of mutual aid is
exercised during Searches and Rescues (see the Search and Rescue Annex to this plan). When
necessary, the chief of the Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch coordinates requests for out of
state law enforcement mutual aid through the governor’s office of the concerned neighboring
state.
In 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger signed legislation adopting the Emergency Management
Assistance Compact (EMAC) as the primary guidance for the exchange of resources between
States. This document allows for the prompt responses of necessary resources to other States
upon emergency declaration by the affected State’s Governor.
These provisions are in addition to the authorities and procedures in place within the California
Vehicle Code and California Penal Code for investigations, pursuits and other criminal matters
near state boundaries.
Federal Resources
Acquisition of federal resources in support of local law enforcement emergency operations can
be coordinated through the Cal OES Law Enforcement Branch. While day-to-day cooperation
from federal law enforcement agencies need not involve this office, during emergencies or major
unusual occurrences it is important to ensure that federal assistance is provided in a coordinated,
equitable basis –often to multiple locations.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

Specific State Agencies
Agency California Department of Consumer Affairs-Division of Investigations
Authority California Penal Code, California Business and Professions Code
Roles The Division of Investigation provides centralized law enforcement investigative
services for the various regulatory boards, bureaus, programs, committees and
commissions within the Department of Consumer Affairs. All investigators
employed by the Division of Investigation are P.O.S.T. certified sworn peace
officers who are authorized to conduct criminal and administrative
investigations, obtain and execute search warrants, serve legal processes and
make arrests anywhere within the State of California.
The goal is to protect the health, safety and welfare of California consumers by
conducting investigations and by filing criminal, administrative and civil actions
against licensees on behalf of the client agencies with the Department of
Consumer Affairs. Examples of such investigations include fraud, unlicensed
activities, assault and battery, narcotics and drug violations, sexual misconduct,
patient abuse, wrongful death, workplace violence, threat assessment,
enforcement of restraining orders, and theft. Investigators are also detailed for
dignitary protection, peacekeeping, security services at hearings, and public
meetings held by the client agencies.
Resources Approximately 58peace officers assigned to Division of Investigation offices
statewide.
Procedures Request for staff or resources should be directed through the office of the Chief
Investigator or the Deputy Chief Investigator. The contact telephone numbers
are: (916) 324-1534 or (916) 445-2537.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

Agency California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
Authority 8598, 8628 Government Code
Roles Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation employees of the correctional
series, responding under formal mutual aid, have the full powers of peace
officers as defined under Section 830.2 of the California Penal Code. Therefore;
when mutual aid response is authorized, missions accepted will not be limited to
operation of detention facilities.
Ensure that the mission tasking requested is consistent with the level of training
and experience of the responders by consulting with the Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation Emergency Operations staff.
Resources Approximately19,000 correctional peace officers at 92 facilities and institutions
throughout the state. Additional support may be available from 1,600 parole
agent personnel also stationed throughout the state. The Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation also maintains and operates a large fleet of
prisoner transportation vehicles which may also be made available on official
request.
Policy It is the policy of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to assist local
law enforcement in a manner consistent with the California Mutual Aid Plan
when sufficient resources are available.

Agency State Military Forces (California National Guard)
Authority California Military and Veteran’s Code
Roles To assist civil authority in thedischarge of lawful responsibilities by performing
tasks which include but are not limited to; restoration and maintenance of law
and order, protection of life and property, limited removal of debris, medical
evacuation and limited medical treatment, search and rescue, emergency
communications, and general logistics support.
Normally, the CNG will be placed in support of law enforcement agencies and
will not usurp or accept the responsibility or authority of civil authorities.
Military assistance once provided will be terminated at the earliest practical time
at the restoration of law and order,or the resumption of control of local law
enforcement.
In order for the Adjutant General, CNG, to properly evaluate the emergency and
the need to implement certain procedures that will reduce the reaction time of
CNG forces upon call-up, it is essential that early and frequent evaluations of the
disturbance or condition and its potential be made by senior law enforcement
officials and forwarded through the normal Cal OES communication channels,
or directly to the liaison detachment of the Military Department when on the
scene.
Resources Resource availability is dependent on federal deployments and other
commitments; numbers vary accordingly.
Policy The Governor may order the CNG to perform military duty of every description.
The Governor will normally commit the CNG resources in support of civil
authority, but only upon determination that emergency conditions exist or are
imminent, that all civil resources reasonably available have been or will be
committed, that civil authority cannot or will not be able to control the situation,
and that military assistance is required and has been requested as provided in
law. CNG resources cannot be used in violation of the Economy Act, which
requires civilian or commercial resources to be sought before considering use of
the Guard.
Under the provisions of Section 143 of the California Military and Veterans
Code, the Governor may commit CNG resources without a request from civil
authority only under highly perilous conditions where local civil authority no
longer exists or is unable or unwilling to employ available civil resources to
control or mitigate asituation. (Cont)Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
Page 28
State Military Forces (California National Guard) (Cont)
CNG in support of local law enforcement will receive and execute broad
mission-type orders of the civil officer in charge, but will at all times remain
under the military chain of command. The provisions of Section 365 of the
Military and Veterans Code assign all decisions as to tactical direction of troops,
type and extent of force to be used, and particular means to be employed to
accomplish the objective or goal specified by the civil officer in charge directly
to the military commander.
Procedures Any request for National Guard resources must be forwarded to the
Governor through the CalOES.
Note: Under the stress of emergency conditions, local officials occasionally
disregard the mutual aid system in requesting CNG assistance. This results in
unnecessary delays in providing a response. Requests must be directed through
the Law Enforcement Regional Coordinator to the Cal OES Law Enforcement
Coordinator to ensure that all available manpower has been reasonably
committed. If at that time it is determined that activation of CNG forces is the
most appropriate and expedient means of meeting the requirement, a Cal OES
mission number will be issued and military support rendered.
Response The CNG will make every effort to respond to the scene of an unusual
occurrence in the most expeditious manner.Some responses may require the
mobilization of additional personnel that are not on active duty at the time of the
request. In such cases the CNG will respond initially with liaison personnel and
upon gubernatorial approval, will expand deployment based on their assessment
of the situation and its potential to worsen. Depending upon global and statewide
commitments, additional CNG field resources can be expected to arrive on-scene
no later than 24 hours after approval of the initial request.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

within the operational area are coordinated.
Duties and Responsibilities
The Coordinator must have a working knowledge of the Law Enforcement Mutual Aid

System and the procedures that enable it to operate efficiently.
One or more points-of-contact should be identified at the coordinator’s employing agency.

This individual should serve as the Coordinator’s “subject matter expert” and should assist in
the actual development and maintenance of the Operational Area’s Law Enforcement Mutual
Aid capability.
The Coordinator should assess the mutual aid resources in the operational area, as well as the

level of training related to mutual aid.
The Coordinator should serve as a relaypoint for communication of threat, warning and

preparedness information to all law enforcement agencies in the operational area.
The Coordinator should ensure that links exist to share appropriate threat, warning and

those for fire and EMS.
 Develop a dispatching procedure for mutual aid use of law enforcement resources,
both for in-county and out-of-county response.
The Coordinator is responsible for coordinating response of all law enforcement resources

within the operational area on major mutual aid operations.
The Coordinator also evaluates requests for assistance from local agencies; determines the

resources within the operational area that can provide timely assistance, and initiates their

REGIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID COORDINATOR ELECTION
PROCESS
Background
Consistent with the Standardized Emergency Management System, California’s Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid System consists of inter-related layers, from field operations through
state coordination. Key in this process are the roles of the Operational Area Law Enforcement
Mutual Aid Coordinator and the Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator.
The responsibility for monitoring law enforcement activities within each Operational Area is
vested in an Operational Area Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator. Similarly, the
Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator has the responsibility to monitor events and
incidents in the region’s operational areas, and to ensure timely coordination and provision of
law enforcement mutual aid resources in the region.
Much of the success of any system depends upon the capabilities of the individuals serving at the
various levels in the chain of command, and acceptance of their expertise by their peers. This
document outlines the process for the election of Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid
Coordinators.
Term
Elections for Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinators should be conducted at least
once every four years, to coincide with the Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid
Coordinator’s term of office as Sheriff. If a Regional Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator
leaves office as Sheriff during an un-expired term, notification must be made to the State Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator so that a special election may be held. When such a
vacancy occurs, the State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator will appoint an "Acting"
Regional Law Enforcement Coordinator to serve until the formal election process is completed.
Election Process
Regional Law Enforcement Coordinator elections will be conducted by mail ballot, or at a
special regional law enforcement mutual aid meeting called by the State Law Enforcement
Mutual Aid Coordinator. Nominations will be sought from the Operational Area Law
Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinators. If the majority of nominations are for the same
individual, that person shall be declared elected. If there is no clear winner, a written or voice
vote will take place. In the event of a tie the State Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Coordinator
will cast the deciding vote. Note that elections will be documented with written records of the
proceedings.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan

19 CCR 2401 (California Code of Regulations) These regulations establish the Standardized
Emergency Management System (SEMS) based upon the Incident Command System (ICS)
adapted from the system originally developed by the Firefighting Resources of California
Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE) program including those currently in use by
state agencies, the Multi-Agency Coordination System (MACS) as developed by FIRESCOPE
program, the operational area concept, and the Master Mutual Aid Agreement and related mutual
aid systems.
SEMS is intended to standardize response to emergencies involving multiple jurisdictions or
multiple agencies. SEMS is intended to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of all emergency
responders in California. SEMS requires emergency response agencies use basic principles and
components of emergency management including ICS, multi-agency or inter-agency
coordination, the operational area concept, and established mutual aid systems. State agencies
must use SEMS. Local government must use SEMS by December 1, 1996 in order to be
eligible for state funding of response-related personnel costs pursuant to activities identified in
California Code of Regulations, Title 19, §2920, §2925, and §2930. Individual agencies' roles
and responsibilities contained in existing laws or the state emergency plan are not superseded by
these regulations.Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan
